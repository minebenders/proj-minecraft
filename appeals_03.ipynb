They, however, rejected the submission made on behalf of the appellants that bringing drugs into Singapore with a view solely of exporting them would not be an offence under s 7 of the Act. They also rejected Ko’s defence that he did not know that what he was carrying was diamorphine. Accordingly, they convicted the appellants. Against the convictions, this appeal was brought. At the conclusion we dismissed it, and we now give our reasons.Ground (a) can be disposed of very briefly. By s 18(2) of the Act a rebuttable presumption arose that Ko knew the nature of the drug that he was carrying. Once the presumption arose, the onus of discharging it was on Ko. Having heard Ko’s defence, the trial judges were satisfied that he had not discharged the presumption. We have reviewed the record and it is clear that the trial judges were entitled on the evidence before them to arrive at this finding. We saw no reason to interfere.and submitted that s 7 was applicable only when it was sought to punish a master or captain who had contravened s 20. We could not accept that submission. In common with a number of other similar provisions in the Act, what s 20 does is to raise a presumption as to knowledge. By s 20, if it is proved that a drug was found in a ship or aircraft, then the presumption would arise that the drug was imported in the ship or aircraft with the knowledge of the master or captain. No doubt, in such a case, a master or captain may be charged for violating s 7 of the Act but that does not mean to say that s 7 is confined in its operations only to the master of a ship or captain of an aircraft used for the import of drugs. We see no reason why s 7 should not operate against (say) a passenger in a ship or aircraft who was importing drugs. Against such a passenger the presumption under s 20 as to knowledge would obviously not be applicable but (as in this case) the presumption under s 18(2) would apply.\",\n",

      " In the premises, we found the charge against the appellant established beyond a reasonable doubt and dismissed the appeal. Wan quite clearly stated that he received only one red plastic bag that day on the ground floor lift lobby of Block 106. There was no other transaction. The evidence of the CNB officers as to what they witnessed that day at Block 106 was consistent with that. By the operation of s 30 of the Evidence Act, the confessions of Wan could be used to incriminate his co-accused, the appellant: see Chin Seow Noi v PP[27] supra). In the light of Wan’s statements, as well as the statement of the appellant that he did pass a red plastic bag to Wan (albeit that he said it contained clothes), the inference which could reasonably be drawn was that the plastic bag which the appellant had given to Wan had, to his knowledge, contained the prohibited drugs. We, therefore, agreed with the trial judge that a prima facie case had been established that there was a common intention between the appellant and Wan to put the latter in possession of the said drugs. The appellant was rightly called upon to enter his defence. The last sentence in the above extract clearly had the test propounded in Ang Sunny v PP [1965–1967] SLR(R) 123 in mind, where it was held that before circumstantial evidence could be used to secure an accused’s conviction, it must lead to the irresistible inference and conclusion that the accused committed the crime. But that test was only applicable at the close of the trial and not at the stage of the close of the case for the Prosecution. This was the important distinction drawn in Tan Siew Chay ([41] supra), which was affirmed in PP v Oh Laye Koh [1994] 2 SLR(R) 120. In the light of the authorities on how s 163(1) should be applied, we held that the trial judge did act correctly when he allowed the amendment of the charge. The principle stated in Lee Ngin Kiat v PP ([27] supra) remains applicable. But it should be viewed in the right perspective as in Lee Ngin Kiat this court was concerned with the situation where an appellate court proceeded to amend the charge well after the trial had been concluded. Obviously in that situation, even greater caution must be exercised in permitting an amendment.\n",

      " For these reasons, we dismiss the appeals. Mr Jayaratnam also noted that the appellant is not eligible for caning. This is another factor that the court may take into account in adjusting the prison sentence. The appellant also faced a number of other charges that he consented to being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. This too is a factor that the court may have regard to in enhancing the sentence (Re Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh [2019] 5 SLR 1037 at [48]–[49]). Finally, the appellant had a number of related antecedents. Taken together, it did not appear to be the case at all that the sentence imposed by the Judge was excessive, much less manifestly so. We therefore had no hesitation in dismissing the appeal against sentence. Taking these pieces of evidence together, we are amply satisfied that it was Akebal that handed the bag to Andi. That would mean that he had actual possession of the bag with the drugs, that he handed it to Andi and so engaged in the act of trafficking. The Prosecution is entitled to invoke the presumption of knowledge, which has not been rebutted. Akebal’s appeal is therefore without merit and accordingly dismissed. First, there is the consistent testimony of Andi. As we have noted above, Andi identified Akebal as the man who handed him the orange bag that contained the drugs in his contemporaneous statement, which was made several hours before Akebal’s arrest. He subsequently repeated this in his long statement. There was no reason for Andi to falsely implicate Akebal and, prior to the appeal, this had not been suggested. At the appeal, Mr Seah for the first time, attempted to suggest that there might have been a conspiracy to which Andi was a party, to frame Akebal. This had never been explored or suggested at trial. Mr Seah accepted this and candidly admitted that he was just putting forward possible inferences that could be drawn from the evidence and suggested that this should be considered by us before dispensing with the appeal.

      " For these reasons, we dismiss the appeals. Mr Jayaratnam also noted that the appellant is not eligible for caning. This is another factor that the court may take into account in adjusting the prison sentence. The appellant also faced a number of other charges that he consented to being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. This too is a factor that the court may have regard to in enhancing the sentence (Re Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh [2019] 5 SLR 1037 at [48]–[49]). Finally, the appellant had a number of related antecedents. Taken together, it did not appear to be the case at all that the sentence imposed by the Judge was excessive, much less manifestly so. We therefore had no hesitation in dismissing the appeal against sentence. Taking these pieces of evidence together, we are amply satisfied that it was Akebal that handed the bag to Andi. That would mean that he had actual possession of the bag with the drugs, that he handed it to Andi and so engaged in the act of trafficking. The Prosecution is entitled to invoke the presumption of knowledge, which has not been rebutted. Akebal’s appeal is therefore without merit and accordingly dismissed. First, there is the consistent testimony of Andi. As we have noted above, Andi identified Akebal as the man who handed him the orange bag that contained the drugs in his contemporaneous statement, which was made several hours before Akebal’s arrest. He subsequently repeated this in his long statement. There was no reason for Andi to falsely implicate Akebal and, prior to the appeal, this had not been suggested. At the appeal, Mr Seah for the first time, attempted to suggest that there might have been a conspiracy to which Andi was a party, to frame Akebal. This had never been explored or suggested at trial. Mr Seah accepted this and candidly admitted that he was just putting forward possible inferences that could be drawn from the evidence and suggested that this should be considered by us before dispensing with the appeal. We see no basis for mounting such a contention. Nonetheless, having regard to the fact that Andi was a co‐accused, we would have been prepared to reconsider the weight of his testimony had this been the sole basis for convicting Akebal. But any such possibility of a conspiracy or of false testimony being led against Akebal, as well as the suggestion that Andi’s identification of Akebal in his contemporaneous statement should be viewed with circumspection because he was having withdrawal symptoms at the time, is not weighty once the surrounding circumstances are considered.\n",

      " The Judges’ Rules referred to in the judgment are the Judges’ Rules then in force in England, and r 7 thereof was identical with r 8 of Sched E to proviso (b) of sub-s (5) of s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code then in force. But sub-s (5) (which was the precursor of the existing sub-s (6) of s 122) and Sched E were introduced to the Criminal Procedure Code by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 1960. Section 121 (now s 122) by sub-s (5) thereof for the first time allowed a statement made at any time by a person who is charged with an offence in the hearing of a police officer of or above the rank of inspector to be admissible in evidence at his trial, but such admission was expressly made subject to two provisos, namely: (a) proviso (a) which was in pari materia with the proviso to the existing s 122(5); and (b) proviso (b) which is as follows: In recording the statements from Tan and Lim respectively, SNO Vijakumar asked them several questions on the statements and the answers were given by them respectively. It was argued by counsel that SNO Vijakumar cross-examined them on the statements recorded, and such cross-examinations were improper and rendered the statements inadmissible. The trial judges considered the evidence and the explanation given by SNO Vijakumar for asking the questions, and held that the questions were not put to them by way of cross-examination. We are unable to agree with the views of the trial judges on this point. In our opinion, the questions asked were more than those truly required for clarification. They were asked with a view to eliciting answers from the maker of the statement which would be evidence favourable to the party questioning. SNO Vijakumar need not have asked, and ought not to have asked, those questions. The purpose of s 122(6) of the CPC is to inform the accused of the charge he is facing and to give him an opportunity of stating any fact on which he intends to rely in his defence in court and further to warn him that if he does not state it then, his silence may give rise to an adverse inference against him. The role of a recording officer is spelt out in s 122(6): to prefer and read out the charge to the accused or to inform him officially of the charge, to serve on him a notice in writing in terms as prescribed in that subsection, to explain the notice to him, and thereafter if the accused wishes to say anything, to record accurately what he says. It is no part of the duty of such recording officer to ask the accused any question in relation to what he said. In our opinion, any cross-examination conducted by a recording officer on the statement taken from the accused under s 122(6) is improper, and we disapprove it. Any other form of questioning, unless it is absolutely necessary, is wholly inadvisable and is to be discouraged. Assuming that there was an error made by the trial judges, as contended on behalf of the appellants, in our judgment, no miscarriage of justice at all has occurred in this case. The evidence against Sim was overwhelming, and so also was the evidence against Tan and Lim. Apart from the admissibility of the three statements of the appellants, there was substantially no dispute on the evidence adduced by the Prosecution in any material respect. As for those statements, their admissibility was challenged but the trial judges, after the trial within a trial, were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were made voluntarily, and, accordingly, they were admitted in evidence. In our judgment, on such evidence, the trial judges could not have reached any other conclusion than that the guilt of the appellants had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Plainly, this is a case where the proviso to s 54 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) is applicable. Having reached that conclusion and in view of the fact that the Defence had not tendered any evidence by the appellants or any other witness the trial judges probably considered that it would be tautologous to repeat the same exercise. It seems to us that for that reason they said they had no alternative but to convict the appellants.\n",

      " and submitted that s 7 was applicable only when it was sought to punish a master or captain who had contravened s 20. We could not accept that submission. In common with a number of other similar provisions in the Act, what s 20 does is to raise a presumption as to knowledge. By s 20, if it is proved that a drug was found in a ship or aircraft, then the presumption would arise that the drug was imported in the ship or aircraft with the knowledge of the master or captain. No doubt, in such a case, a master or captain may be charged for violating s 7 of the Act but that does not mean to say that s 7 is confined in its operations only to the master of a ship or captain of an aircraft used for the import of drugs. We see no reason why s 7 should not operate against (say) a passenger in a ship or aircraft who was importing drugs. Against such a passenger the presumption under s 20 as to knowledge would obviously not be applicable but (as in this case) the presumption under s 18(2) would apply. Ground (a) can be disposed of very briefly. By s 18(2) of the Act a rebuttable presumption arose that Ko knew the nature of the drug that he was carrying. Once the presumption arose, the onus of discharging it was on Ko. Having heard Ko’s defence, the trial judges were satisfied that he had not discharged the presumption. We have reviewed the record and it is clear that the trial judges were entitled on the evidence before them to arrive at this finding. We saw no reason to interfere. The trial judges accepted that both the appellants had come into Singapore only with a view to boarding a flight to Amsterdam the next day. They, however, rejected the submission made on behalf of the appellants that bringing drugs into Singapore with a view solely of exporting them would not be an offence under s 7 of the Act. They also rejected Ko’s defence that he did not know that what he was carrying was diamorphine. Accordingly, they convicted the appellants. Against the convictions, this appeal was brought.

      " Accordingly, for the reasons given above, we dismissed the appeals and confirmed the sentences imposed by the High Court. In the course of his argument, Mr Lim cited a hypothetical case: John departs from Sydney on board a flight bound for London. He has with him a packet of diamorphine; his intention was to hand over the diamorphine to someone in London. The flight stops over as scheduled in Singapore for refuelling and John remains in the aircraft. On information received, the CNB searches John while he is in the aircraft and finding the diamorphine, charges him with importing drugs. Counsel contended that it would be unjust to convict John of importing drugs. We disagree, for to accept counsel’s argument would be to allow the movement of drugs through Singapore. It is a problem that, if not peculiar to Singapore, is heightened by our geographical location. In our view, to construe “import” so as to exclude the hypothetical example would be to shirk from our responsibilities under the Convention. We see no distinction between the hypothetical example and the situation in Salvador ([28] supra) and agree with the decision in that case. A person does not enter Singapore involuntarily simply because the flight that he is on makes a scheduled stop in Singapore either for refuelling or for picking up passengers or both. He books himself for that flight fully aware that it will enter the territory of Singapore. The meaning of the word “import” in s 5 of the Narcotic Control Act was also considered in R v Salvador, Wannamaker, Campbell and Nunes (1981) 59 CCC (2d) 521; the facts of that case highlight the width given to the natural and ordinary meaning of “import” by the Canadian courts. The accused persons in that case were the captain and members of the crew of a yacht which had sailed from Morocco with a cargo of 8,300lbs of cannabis resin, intending to import it into the United States. The yacht encountered bad weather and suffered damage to its rudder. At the material time, the yacht was just off the coast of Canada and the transcript of the radio transmissions between the yacht and the coastguard showed that the accused accepted the coastguard’s offer of a tow to safe harbour in Canadian waters. The evidence of the accused did not contradict the fact that they knew that the tow would bring them into Canadian waters. The cargo of cannabis was discovered when the yacht was in safe harbour and the accused were charged and convicted of importing the cannabis into Canada contrary to s 5 of the Narcotic Control Act. The accused appealed to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, contending that the trial judge had erred in his direction to the jury inasmuch as he did not direct them that the entry into Canada had to be voluntary. The court reviewed the authorities on the meaning of import and approved, inter alia, Geesman ([9] supra) and MacDonald JA, delivering the main judgment of the court, stated the following essential elements of the charge of importation under s 5 (at 540): It is helpful in the present discussion of the Convention to consider the decisions in other jurisdictions which are signatories to the Convention on the meaning of “import”. In R v Geesman ([9] supra), the accused was arrested at an airport in Canada following the discovery of hashish on him. He was charged with having imported a narcotic drug into Canada contrary to s 5 of the Narcotic Control Act 1961. His defence was that he had brought the hashish into Canada for the sole purpose of carrying it across the country in order to transport the substance across the border with the United States. Counsel for the accused contended that this intention was an intention merely to transit through Canada and not to import drugs into Canada, and that on a strict construction of s 5 of the Narcotic Control Act, the charge was not made out. That Act did not define “import”. O’Meara JSP rejected the argument and held that the word “import” had to be given its natural and ordinary meaning. The learned judge said (at 244):\n",

      " Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. We affirm the verdict and the mandatory sentence passed by the trial judges. Another point raised by Cheuk is that the trial judges should not have allowed a joint trial as it has in this case occasioned a miscarriage of justice. Section 176 of the Criminal Procedure Code permits a joint trial where more than one person is accused of the same offence or of different offences in the same transaction. Her counsel submitted that Tse and Cheuk were not charged for the same offence nor were the offences committed in the same transaction. He submitted that though the accused did not object to the joint trial it was no less a nullity. He said that the joint trial prejudiced Cheuk in two ways. First, the unfavourable view which the trial judges took of Tse’s case would have adversely affected hers. Second, since Tse chose to remain silent, Cheuk could not compel Tse to give evidence which would support her case. The only additional case which has been cited to us here and which was not cited to the court in Ng Kwok Chun ([1] supra) is the Australian case R v Bull (1974) 131 CLR 203. There, four men were charged with having committed certain offences against the Australian Customs Act 1901–1974. They were found guilty by the jury of, inter alia, importing into Australia a prohibited import, cannabis, contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Act. The master of the vessel was also convicted of knowingly allowing the vessel to be used in the importation of goods contrary to s 233A of the Act. All the acts and events relied upon by the Prosecution occurred at sea within three miles off the coast of the Northern Territory of Australia. While the vessel was within that limit, it was intercepted by a helicopter and a launch of the Australian authorities. The accused threw into the sea 31,000g of cannabis, which were being brought from Bali to Australia. Before pronouncing judgment, the trial judge stated a case for the consideration of the Australian High Court. Five questions were posed. However, for our present purpose, only question 5 is of relevance: The two appellants herein were tried and convicted before the High Court of the following separate charges:\n",

However, in view of our decision to dismiss the appeal, and in the absence of full argument on the nature and extent of the court’s inherent jurisdiction over its criminal procedure, we would decline to express any definitive view on Mr Sant Singh’s contentions although we are of the preliminary view that such a power to stay criminal proceedings in circumstances where it can be shown that the accused could not have a fair trial exists. The learned DPP conceded in his reply that the appeal would fail if we found against him on the issue of joint custody or joint possession of the Gucci bag. However, in view of counsel’s arguments on the question of common intention, we will deal briefly with the views we formed on this element of the charge against the respondent. In R v Strong The Times (26 January 1989), the English Court of Appeal had to consider the question of what the Prosecution has to prove in order to make out the charge of joint possession of cannabis where the cannabis was found concealed in the car in which the accused were travelling. Lord Lane LCJ is reported as having said: The distinction is thus between inculpatory and exculpatory parts of a statement. We did not see how the statements as regards the plan to smuggle contraband could be taken as inculpatory with reference to a charge of attempting to export controlled drugs. If the truth of her statement that the contraband was Du Pont pens and lighters could not be accepted at this stage, then equally we could not accept that there was a plan to smuggle. On that basis, by the DPP’s own concession that the events in Singapore alone did not prove joint possession of the diamorphine, the Prosecution had not made out its case.\n",

      " Having perused the record of appeal, however, we feel it necessary at the same time to add our observations as regards the decision in the court below to disallow the admission of the appellant’s s 122(6) statement recorded by Senior Narcotics Officer Chew. Two reasons were given for this decision. Firstly, the fact that the appellant had not been given any food or drink after his arrest and up to the time the s 122(6) statement was being recorded (a period of about seven hours) was held to have “sapped” his free will. Secondly, there was apparently some confusion as to whether the appellant had been taken to hospital for his post-statement medical examination immediately after his statement was recorded (as the appellant claimed) or whether there had been a delay of about half an hour (as Chew claimed); and this confusion was held to have thrown the integrity of the recording process into question. Having regard to the reasons given above we dismissed the appeal. We were also of the view that in any case the learned judicial commissioner did not actually rely on the evidence of Koh’s pocket book entries in coming to his decision. Although he set out the contents of the pocket book entries in his judgment, this was done as part of the process of setting out the relevant background to the case. He referred to Koh’s evidence again when rejecting the appellant’s defence of duress but this reference was made after he had examined the evidence given by the appellant in court and found that on the basis of the appellant’s own evidence, the defence of duress was not made out. Indeed, the reference to Koh’s pocket book entries was somewhat perfunctory since by that stage it was eminently clear that, in dismissing the defence of duress, it would be unnecessary to rely on the evidence of the pocket book entries. We were of the view therefore that the admission of Koh’s pocket book entries as evidence did not occasion the appellant such prejudice as to deprive him of a fair trial. Since neither defence raised by the appellant was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case, the appellant was convicted of the charge against him.\n",

      " Having found the respondent’s acquittal to be against the weight of the evidence, we accordingly allowed the appeal, convicted the respondent and sentenced him to death. As was held by Spenser-Wilkinson J in Tara Singh v PP [1949] MLJ 88 at 89, the principle is that an impression as to the demeanour of the witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence. Thus in the present case, we were not satisfied from the reasons given in his findings that the trial judge had in the present case sufficiently considered all the evidence against the respondent, especially the contradictions and lies told by the respondent, when he came to a conclusion as to his veracity. In fact, as we have already observed, the respondent’s evidence at some points was quite incredible. We were firmly convinced that he was not a credible witness and had not succeeded in rebutting the presumption of knowledge, and the trial judge ought to have rejected his innocent bailee defence. A reading of the above section shows that the powers that this court can exercise on an appeal from an acquittal are not subject to any express limitation. As the appeal in the present case is primarily an appeal on fact, we turn to the Privy Council decision of Sheo Swarup v King-Emperor AIR 1934 PC 227 where the Board succinctly set out the principles that a High Court should consider when dealing with acquittals on a matter of fact from the sessions court. There, the relevant provision in the Indian Criminal Procedure Code under consideration was s 423 which is similar to our s 54 in that there was no limitation or restriction on the High Court in the exercise of its power as an appellate tribunal. We therefore consider the observations of the Board highly instructive. It was our view that at the close of the prosecution case, the prosecution evidence against the respondent was actually the strongest as compared to that against the other conspirators as quite apart from the other evidence adduced against him, the respondent had to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the drugs in his car boot on a balance of probabilities while the other three only had to raise a reasonable doubt.\n",

      " Kong, in his defence, did not give any explanation at all – not to mention any plausible explanation – that his involvement in the matter was purely coincidental and had nothing to do with the transportation of the drugs by Tan and Yeap. He met Warren Lee at Mandarin Hotel on the morning of 16 July 1989; he did not explain the purpose of such meeting and no evidence was given as to how long he had known Warren Lee. He went with Warren Lee to Plaza Hotel to meet Tan and Yeap, and there he alone went up to Room 634 and introduced himself to Tan and Yeap. His explanation was that Warren Lee asked him to do that but there was no explanation why he should or would do such a thing at the mere bidding of Warren Lee. On his evidence, he did not know Tan and Yeap and they were Warren Lee’s friends; yet at the mere request of Warren Lee, he would go to their room to meet them unaccompanied by Warren Lee. Later, he and Warren Lee boarded a taxi at Plaza Hotel and led Tan and Yeap in Yeap’s car to Mandarin Hotel and on arrival, both he and Warren Lee alighted at the entrance. He then went into Yeap’s car and led Tan and Yeap to the car park in Mandarin Hotel, collected the car key and then parted company with them. Again, no explanation was given for this somewhat devious exercise. What was the purpose of leading Tan and Yeap to Mandarin Hotel, showing them the car park and collecting the key to the car from them? Assuming that he did this at the request of Warren Lee, then the inevitable question was: What was his reason or explanation for doing all these at the request of Warren Lee? By taking over or collecting the key from Tan and Yeap, he took possession of the car. Under s 18(1) of the Act, he is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have possession of the drugs at the time, and under s 17 he is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking therein. In these circumstances, it is incumbent on him to show that he did not know that the drugs were in the fuel tank and that his involvement was purely coincidental. That he has not succeeded in doing. The evidence of Tan and Yeap therefore is not required to be corroborated and the court is not required to warn itself about convicting Kong on the uncorroborated evidence of Tan and Yeap. It has not been suggested that that part of the evidence of Tan and Yeap implicating Kong was self-serving and for the purpose of exonerating themselves at the expense of Kong or was given with any improper motive. At any rate, there was no evidence of this nature. We therefore reject the second main argument that the trial judge erred in relying on the evidence of Tan and Yeap in making his findings against Kong. We now turn to the first main argument. The first oral statement was said to have been made by Kong to SNO Peter Lim in his office in CNB with NO Ng acting as the Mandarin interpreter. Counsel submitted that evidence adduced to prove that the statement was made was wholly unsatisfactory and should not have been accepted by the trial judge. Firstly, NO Ng was the arresting officer and should not have acted as the interpreter and a wholly independent person against whom no allegation of bias could be made should have acted as the interpreter: R v Mitchell [1970] Crim LR 153 and Cheong See Leong v PP (1949) 15 MLJ 67; (1948–49) MLJ Supp 56. This argument has no merit. SNO Peter Lim was at that time investigating a serious offence and it was clearly in order for him to interview Kong with the help of NO Ng as the interpreter in Mandarin. There is no principle of law which requires that on such occasion an interpreter not involved in the investigation should be called upon to interpret. There is no allegation of bias against either SNO Peter Lim or NO Ng, and we cannot see any objection in NO Ng acting as the Mandarin interpreter for SNO Peter Lim in such an interview. The case of R v Mitchell is wholly irrelevant. There, at the trial, the judge allowed a waiter of the restaurant, the proprietor of which had complained against the accused, to act as the interpreter and it was held that such act amounted to an irregularity of such a character as to make it unsafe in the circumstances to let the conviction stand. In Cheong See Leong the accused was convicted of an offence under the emergency regulations. At the trial evidence was given of a statement of the accused alleged to have been made to the inspector through the interpretation of a detective sergeant who was a member of the investigation team. It was held that the use of the police sergeant as an interpreter who was fully conversant with the material facts and was subsequently called by the Prosecution offended against the elementary ideas of justice and therefore no reliance could be placed on the accuracy of the statement. This case was reported in a note form which is not at all adequate, and we are unable to ascertain precisely the reasoning for the decision. We are not persuaded that the principle laid down in Cheong See Leong is applicable on this occasion when SNO Peter Lim was interviewing or questioning Kong with the assistance of NO Ng acting as an interpreter. On these facts, which were not disputed, the following presumptions under the provisions of the Act arise. Firstly, as the drugs were found in the car which was owned by Yeap but which at the material time was driven by Tan, under s 21 the drugs are presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be in the possession of Yeap as the owner of the car and Tan as the person in charge of the car for the time being. Secondly, under s 17 they are presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have had the drugs in their possession for the purpose of trafficking and under s 18(2) of the Act, they are presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have known the nature of the drugs. They transported the drugs all the way from Haadyai to Singapore and in Singapore from Plaza Hotel to the car park in Mandarin Hotel. Proof of the act of transporting plus the presumption under s 17 would constitute a prima facie case of trafficking which, if unrebutted, would warrant their convictions: Wong Kee Chin v PP [1977–1978] SLR(R) 628 at [33]. The only question therefore is whether Tan and Yeap have rebutted this prima facie case on the balance of probabilities.\n",

      " Counsel for the appellant referred the court to Sarkar on Evidence (14th Ed, 1993) and submitted that the onus of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt was always on the Prosecution. Suspicion, it was argued, cannot take the place of legal proof. This argument was premised on a misunderstanding of s 18 of the Act. It is accepted that the onus is always on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt but, in the context of the Act, the law has provided the Prosecution with presumptions and the court must have regard to them. Once the presumptions were triggered in this case the onus was on the accused to discharge the presumptions. It would then be up to the court to decide whether or not to believe him; to assess his credibility and veracity; to observe his demeanour; to listen to what he had to say; to go through the evidence and determine whether his story was consistent; and finally to make a judicial decision. By his counsel’s own concession, the appellant’s conduct was suspect and indeed that he might have suspected that something was amiss. Given this scenario, the appellant’s task of rebutting the presumptions on a balance of probabilities must surely have been rendered extremely difficult from the outset. We are therefore of the view that it was impossible to fault the trial judge’s decision. Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal. By s 18 of the Act, rebuttable presumptions arose that the appellant had the drug in his possession and that he knew the nature of the drug he was carrying. Once the presumptions arose, the onus of discharging them was on the appellant. Having heard the appellant’s defence, the learned trial judge was satisfied that he had not discharged this onus. On reviewing the record we are of the view that the trial judge’s finding was clearly ineluctable. The appellant’s reason for adducing additional evidence at this stage of the proceedings was that these documents were retained by the prison authorities despite his instructions that they be handed to his lawyer. Without expressing any opinion as regards the first condition of “non-availability”, we are of the view that the second and third conditions of “relevance” and “reliability” have not been met. Counsel for the appellant conceded that the additional evidence sought to be admitted had no bearing on the question of guilt or innocence of the appellant. The additional evidence was instead adduced for the rather tenuous reason that, had they been available at the trial, the trial judge’s impression of the appellant would have been different. The test of relevance is more stringent than that. We reiterate that the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case. As for the condition of “reliability”, we note that one of the certificates of guarantee was actually made out to “Mrs E Van Damme” and more significantly, was dated “26 September 1991”. Nowhere in the appellant’s testimony regarding his movements on 26 September 1991 did he mention visiting the jewellers. As for the business cards, there was absolutely no evidence as to when they might have been procured by the appellant. Accordingly, we found that there was no merit in the application and we dismissed the motion. The appellant was charged under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) for importing two packets of substance containing not less than 4,320g of diamorphine into Singapore. The appellant’s defence at the trial was that he did not know that diamorphine was concealed in the suitcase. He claimed that he was an innocent custodian of the suitcase and that he was carrying the bag from Bangkok to Athens as a favour for one John U Obiefuna (“Obiefuna”) who said it contained children’s clothes and clothes for his wife. The learned trial judge rejected the appellant’s defence that he did not know that diamorphine was concealed in the suitcase. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant.

Counsel submitted that if the judge had properly directed himself he might well have found that the appellant had raised a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case. Fourthly, counsel pointed out that the two colourful bags together weighed 60kg, far in excess of the applicable 40kg baggage allowance, but the appellant had only $12 on him, only enough to pay the airport tax and not any charge for the excess baggage. Counsel asked: Appellant’s counsel submitted that there were a number of unsatisfactory aspects in the prosecution case tending to show that the Prosecution had not established the issue of possession beyond reasonable doubt. Firstly, he pointed to the unsatisfactory evidence as to the hotel register. The appellant said that he checked out of the Four Seas Hotel and not the Lion City Hotel, on the day in question. The Lion City Hotel did not have the appellant’s name, and the Four [South] Seas Hotel register had amendments, raising doubts as to the date on which he had checked out of that hotel. Secondly, counsel refers to the list of articles seized from the appellant by the CNB officers. The incriminating colourful bag, Exh P31, and the key said to have been produced by the appellant were not on the list.\n",

      " On appeal, the same arguments that were canvassed before the learned judge were canvassed before us. Just as the learned judge found no merit in them, we too did not find any merit in the appellant’s contentions and accordingly we dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence of death passed by the learned trial judge on the appellant. Firstly, the appellant said he signed his Republic of Niger passport in June 1993, but there were endorsements in the passport dated between January and March 1993, which were unexplained. If the passport had been obtained to allow the appellant to go to Thailand in June 1993, there was no reason for those endorsements. If the endorsements were genuine, then the passport must have been used before it was signed. Secondly, the learned judge could not understand why the appellant signed the passport with a name that was not his own which he claimed he used for signing invoices. If this was true, the learned judge also had difficulty understanding why the appellant would sign invoices with a name which was not his. No explanation for this conduct was given. Thirdly, the inconsistencies in the date of birth and height of the appellant in his two passports were not resolved. Fourthly, the learned trial judge concluded that the false endorsements in the appellant’s Nigerian passport must have been inserted to enable the appellant to travel without revealing that he had visited Thailand and to give the impression that he had left Hong Kong on 8 July 1993 rather than Bangkok. The appellant’s travelling with this passport in his possession contradicted the picture he sought to paint of being an innocent dupe. Fifthly, the conduct of the Udo brothers must have made the appellant suspect that the representations they had made to him were not true. Sixthly, the appellant failed to inform the narcotics officers at the airport, or to state in his cautioned statement, that the bags concerned did not belong to him. All he stated was that a man had given him the bags in Bangkok. In this regard, the learned judge did not accept that Insp Jeyaraje had refused to record all that the appellant had said. Finally, the learned judge was prepared to accept that the appellant did not notice the hidden packets of drugs concealed in the bags. The appellant was charged and convicted of importing into Singapore, on 8 July 1993, not less than 8,968g of diamorphine contrary to s 7 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). He was duly sentenced to death. We heard his appeal against conviction on 15 August 1994 and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.\n",

      " In the circumstances, there were more than substantial grounds to reject the appellant’s evidence as incredible. The learned trial judge had clearly and carefully considered the evidence before him in coming to his conclusion that the appellant was not an innocent carrier without knowledge of the drugs concealed in the bag. The appeal had no merit and accordingly, we dismissed it and confirmed the sentence of death passed by the learned trial judge on the appellant. In our judgment, the learned trial judge was fully justified in coming to that conclusion. The appellant’s evidence was clearly that Sunny knew her by her nickname “Noi” and that she had never told Sunny her full name. However, it was also her evidence that she did not know whether he knew it or not. This being so, we considered an aspect of her evidence which was clearly related. This was the question as to how Sunny’s friend was to contact the appellant in Singapore. The appellant admitted that she did not know how save for the fact that Sunny had told her that his friend would come and look for her at the hotel. She said that she would have given the bag to anyone who came to her and introduced himself as Sunny’s friend. In her evidence, the appellant had also admitted that Sunny did not provide her with any description of his “friend”. It was indeed illogical for the appellant to agree to deliver a bag to an unknown stranger in a foreign country when the intended recipient was unknown to her and the appellant herself did not know if Sunny’s friend knew her full name. It was therefore not unreasonable for the learned trial judge to have concluded that Sunny would not have known the full name of the appellant. On reviewing the evidence, the learned trial judge found several incredible aspects of the evidence of the appellant as to her purpose in coming to Singapore. The learned trial judge disbelieved the appellant’s evidence that she did not know that there were drugs hidden in the leather bag and concluded that the appellant had not, on a balance of probabilities, rebutted the operative presumptions. He was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly convicted her. The learned trial judge was not satisfied that the appellant had, at any time, denied knowledge of the drugs when they were discovered. He noted that the alleged conversation with the Director-General of Excise in Thailand was never properly proved. He held that even if the appellant had told him that she did not know that there was heroin in the bag, “having regard to the prosecution evidence, which I accepted, that she at all times remained silent, nothing turns on her denial”.\n",

      " Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence of death passed by the learned judge on the appellant. We were unable to see how much more random the sampling and analysis procedure could have been. As such, we were entirely satisfied that the scientific tests which were carried out on the nine 5g samples were representative of the entire plant material and it was unnecessary for Ms Granroth to carry out tests on at least 500g of the plant material. As the tests had shown that all nine samples belonged to the plant of the genus cannabis from which the resin had not been extracted, we had no doubt that the Prosecution had proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that the plant material seized from the appellant was not less than 1,026g of cannabis as defined by s 2 of the Act. Mr Almenoar took issue with the learned judge’s comments that to analyse the whole of the contents or a substantial part of it was “an absurd proposition” and “an impossible task no chemist should be required to do”. He referred us to the case of PP v Ang Soon Huat [1990] 2 SLR(R) 246, where Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) had held that, due to the unsatisfactory nature of the scientific analysis of the drugs, there had been a reasonable doubt as to the exact weight of diamorphine which the accused had been charged with trafficking. Mr Almenoar submitted that the Prosecution had failed to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the entire plant material was 1,026g of cannabis since Ms Granroth had only carried out tests on 45g out of the entire 1,026g of plant material.\n",

      " Accordingly we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the verdict and the sentence passed by the judicial commissioner. We were, therefore, of the view that the good character evidence of the appellant, even if accepted, would not affect her conviction as she had admitted that she knew she was carrying cannabis into Singapore. She had even suspected that the substance might have been heroin instead. We found therefore she had failed to rebut the presumptions stated in s 18 of the Act. Counsel for the appellant cited the case of R v Taaffe [1984] 1 All ER 747 for the contention that when the state of an accused person’s mind and his knowledge were ingredients of the offence he was charged with, he had to be judged on the facts as he believed them to be. In our opinion, R v Taaffe was inapplicable for two reasons. Firstly, Taaffe was caught importing a controlled drug. His defence was that he thought that he was smuggling currency and had mistakenly believed this to be an offence. Hence it was held by the House of Lords that even though he had committed the actus reus of importing a controlled drug, he did not have the mens rea of being “knowingly concerned” within s 170 of the English Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. The mere fact that he thought that smuggling currency was illegal (when it was actually legal) could not establish a guilty mind. In the present case, the appellant had admitted that she thought she was carrying cannabis. Unlike the smuggling of currency in Taaffe, which was not a crime in England, cannabis is a controlled drug under the Act, and importation of cannabis is itself a crime in Singapore. At the conclusion of the trial, the judicial commissioner found that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumptions under s 18 of the Act and was thus guilty as charged. The appellant was sentenced to death.\n",

      " Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the court below. As can be seen, s 122(5) of the CPC lays down only two conditions for the admissibility of any statement: that it be made to an officer of a specified rank, and that there be no threat, inducement or promise of the kind which the section makes provision for. Once those conditions are satisfied, the plain words of the section specify that the statement “shall be admissible at his trial in evidence”. Even more to the point, immediately after these words, the section then makes provision for the special case where the accused does in fact testify in his own defence: “if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit”. The clear implication, therefore, is that the statement is admissible as evidence whether the accused gives evidence or not. For these reasons, it is our view that s 122(5) of the CPC allows the Prosecution to use the statement as part of the prosecution case. If the accused does testify, then the Prosecution can go on to cross-examine him on the statement or impeach his credit. The purpose of the s 122(6) warning, then, is merely to warn the accused of the power given to the court by virtue of s 123(1) of the CPC to “draw such inferences ... as appear proper” from an accused person’s refusal to explain any fact which he may reasonably be expected to explain. We were, therefore, of the view that the trial judge erred in not admitting in evidence the appellant’s s 122(6) statement before the defence was called. A s 122(6) statement can and should be admitted as part of the Prosecution’s case. Counsel for the appellant emphasised repeatedly that the third sentence of the s 122(6) statement was “I now know it is a drug”, not “I know it is a drug” and was, therefore, indicative of the absence of knowledge on the part of the appellant. He also stressed most strenuously that the interpreter Wu Nan Yong agreed with him. Wu Nan Yong did, in fact, agree with him that the Cantonese word for “now” had been used by the appellant. However, counsel did not manage to establish that Wu thought the word “now” indicated recent knowledge. Wu appeared to use it to mean the present tense. On re-examination, he stated, “I did not use the word ‘now’ but I used another word ... I used a present tense to indicate that he has knowledge at that time” [emphasis added]. When the deputy public prosecutor repeated the italicised sentence to him he confirmed it. In our view, if the appellant had indeed wished to communicate the idea that he only came to the realisation that the vest contained heroin after his arrest and not at any time before, he could well have stated thus in less subtle language. In our view, this inference was eminently sensible, especially in light of the fact that the appellant did make a cautioned statement. He could easily have given all the facts rather than three brief sentences. In addition, we found the trial judge’s rejection of the appellant’s version of events sound. The appellant’s story was far-fetched, to say the least. There was no reason for Law, if indeed it were Law who instructed the appellant, to have placed another man on the flight just to hand over the vest to the appellant on the plane’s touch-down in Singapore. The appellant’s story as to the unknown Chinese man who handed him the vest was vague and not supported even by a description of the man. In our view, the appellant clearly imported the diamorphine himself.\n",

      " The second ground of appeal is that the trial court admitted and considered evidence which was not relevant to the charge. We do not think there is really any merit in this point. Sections 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act allow such evidence to be admitted. See also John Makin and Sarah Makin v The Attorney-General for New South Wales [1894] AC 57. The learned judicial commissioner was fully conscious of the issue. At two places the judicial commissioner specifically addressed this aspect of the matter. The judicial commissioner did not think that the omission of the words “or presumed” in the later version of the section was significant. He felt that the words “any person who is proved to have had in his possession” in the section did not preclude the Prosecution from relying on the presumption in s 17 even in a case where possession of the drug itself was presumed under s 18. This was how he reasoned ([21] supra): It is now well-established law that, at the close of the prosecution case, it is necessary that there be some evidence, not inherently incredible, which, if it were accepted to be accurate, could establish each essential element of the charge, before the defence may be called: Haw Tua Tau v PP [1981–1982] SLR(R) 133. Counsel for the accused attacked the findings and decision of the trial judge on a number of fronts. Broadly, they may be reduced into three main issues. First, whether the Prosecution had established a prima facie case to warrant calling upon the accused to make his defence. This in turn raises the question whether there was some evidence to prove the elements of “possession”, “knowledge” and “trafficking”. Second, whether the trial judge was wrong to have admitted certain prejudicial evidence which did not have anything to do with the charge. Third, whether the trial judge was wrong to have held that the accused had not shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the drugs were meant to be for his own consumption.\n",

      " That precisely was what had happened in the instant case. In the oral judgment the trial judge stated the charge, the prosecution case, the defence and his findings that the Prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, that he had no doubt that the appellant knew that diamorphine was concealed in the rice cookers, and that, accordingly, the appellant was guilty of the charge. Following what we have said in Goh Lai Wak ([19] supra), we could see no objection to the trial judge in this case providing, subsequent to his oral judgment, his written grounds of decision. In our judgment, these grounds of decision could certainly form part of the record for consideration by this court. Before us, counsel for the appellant raised three main arguments. First, as a preliminary point, he argued that the trial judge had already delivered an oral judgment on 20 September 1993 and erred in law in writing his grounds of decision on 20 December 1993. He submitted that the grounds of decision therefore ought to be disregarded and the court ought to have regard only to the reasons given in the oral judgment. Counsel relied on Ankur Nath Ganguli v PP [1956] MLJ 206, Lorraine Phylis Cohen v PP [1989] 2 MLJ 288 and s 46(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322). Similar argument as this has been canvassed before us very recently in Goh Lai Wak v PP [1994] 1 SLR(R) 563, and, in disposing of such argument, this court said at [34]: The appellant’s passport revealed that he was a Nigerian civil servant. HCO Michael sought confirmation from the appellant in English as to his profession and he replied “civil servant” in English. The appellant was then brought into the customs office where his luggage was searched. HCO Michael asked him if he had anything to declare and the appellant answered in the negative. Upon further questioning, the appellant stated that he came from Bangkok and would be staying two to three days in Singapore after which he would return to Bangkok for a month. He explained that the reason why he carried so much luggage for a short trip was because he intended to send them by special delivery. He replied that he did not have any cigarettes, liquors or drugs. HCO Michael then opened the appellant’s luggage. The black briefcase revealed clothings, coins, a Bible and a Book of Psalms. The grey plastic bag was then searched but only stainless steel items were found. After that, HCO Michael turned his attention to the colourful bag with the verticle stripes. In it were the following: a Kando light weight iron, a National electric pot and frying pan, a Sharp rice cooker and a Zojirushi rice cooker. He then examined the base of the Zojirushi rice cooker and noticed that one of the screws had been tampered with. CCO Tanahgobar was informed of this discovery. HCO Michael took a screwdriver from CCO Tanahgobar and was about to unscrew the base of the rice cooker when the appellant said that he felt like vomiting and tried to leave the room. He was stopped by CCO Tanahgobar from doing so. The appellant was given a plastic bag by CCO Tanahgobar to vomit into but the appellant only spat into it. HCO Michael asked the appellant if the rice cooker was new. The appellant answered in the affirmative and added that he had purchased it in Thailand. When the base of the rice cooker was removed, there was some asbestos lining, and when the lining was removed, there was a blue plastic bag containing a white powdery substance. HCO Michael pointed to the plastic bag and asked him twice what it was. The appellant remained silent. CCO Tanahgobar then checked the Sharp rice cooker and also noticed that the screws at the base had been tampered with. When the base was removed, a white plastic bag containing a white powdery substance was retrieved. When he was asked what it was, the appellant initially remained silent but then uttered “Hallelujah!” twice as well as words which nobody understood. He then said twice: “You can kill me!” The appellant, a Nigerian national, was tried before the High Court on a charge for importing into Singapore six packets of substance containing not less than 2,199g of diamorphine on 29 November 1990 at about 8.00am at Keppel Railway Station, contrary to s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). He was convicted and was sentenced to suffer death. Against his conviction this appeal was brought. We heard the appeal and, at the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed it.

      " For the reasons given above, we also dismissed the second appellant’s appeal. Having regard to all the foregoing, we were of the considered view that there was no merit whatsoever in the first appellant’s appeal and we therefore dismissed it. In effect, therefore, neither Lee Mau Seng ([47] supra) nor the Malaysian cases constituted support for counsel’s submission that the first appellant suffered an injustice in not being granted immediate access to a lawyer following his arrest. There is a world of difference between “within a reasonable time” and “immediately”; and, in our view, two weeks in the present case was a reasonable period of time. In any case, as pointed out by the deputy public prosecutor, the recording of a statement under s 122(6) of the CPC does not compel an accused person to make any statement which incriminates him. The notice given under s 122(6) states only that he has to state any fact which he intends to rely on in his defence in court, and informs him of the consequences of any omission to do so. Wee Chong Jin CJ, in giving the above judgment, did not elaborate on what he considered a “reasonable time” to be. However, since the only exception he allowed was that categorically enacted by statute, it may be surmised that he intended the element of allowance for police investigations and procedure to be already built into the “reasonable time” time-frame. In short, the Lee Mau Seng criterion really led to the same practical result as that set by the Malaysian courts in the above-mentioned cases. In fact, this court preferred the Lee Mau Seng criterion since, with all due respect, it seemed to us somewhat elliptical to say on the one hand that an arrested person had a right to see counsel immediately but to stipulate on the other hand that the police could deny him that right if they needed time to complete investigations.\n",

      " Before concluding our judgment, we wish to note the dilemma the Public Prosecutor was in this case as, without any doubt, there was imported into Singapore, by one or more of these five persons, a quantity of cannabis of an amount which would have resulted in the death sentence being passed on those found guilty. The dilemma he was in was whether to charge all five of them with the importation of the cannabis, in which case he may have lacked the evidence to secure a conviction against any one or more of them. He chose to charge Sugianto and Abdullah against whom it appeared that he had the best evidence. After a careful scrutiny of the evidence as it unfolded at the trial, we have concurred with the learned judicial commissioner that the charges of importing and abetment were not proved against them respectively. The real culprit or culprits have gotten away with it. We can only hope that the Public Prosecutor will be untiring in his efforts to bring the real culprit or culprits, if there was more than one, to answer to the law. Accordingly, the Public Prosecutor’s appeal against the acquittal of Abdullah of conspiring with Sugianto to import the cannabis into Singapore is also dismissed. We can conceive of no alternative charge against Abdullah on the evidence before the High Court. In our judgment, it logically follows from the acquittal of Sugianto of the charge of importing the cannabis into Singapore concealed in the bed quilt packed in P31 that the charge against Abdullah of having conspired with Sugianto to import the cannabis into Singapore concealed in the bed quilt packed in P31 must also fail. The whole of the Prosecution’s case was premised on the fact that P31 belonged to Abdullah; that Sugianto took possession of P31 off the conveyor belt at the arrival hall at Terminal Two, Changi Airport and carried it on the trolley he was pushing; that in his s 122(6) statement Sugianto said that the cannabis belonged to Abdullah; that Abdullah paid Sugianto’s expenses for the visit to Bangkok; that Sugianto stayed in the same room with Abdullah at the Alpine Inn in Bangkok; that Sugianto was told that Abdullah might be bringing back “ganja”; to state some of the allegations presented by the Prosecution and which they sought to prove. Except for Sugianto’s s 122(6) statement, all of the above emanated from the evidence of Najeeb, Edros and Darus. We have pointed out that the learned judicial commissioner took a poor view of the credibility of these three witnesses and, for that reason, not all of the above allegations can be said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Most important of all, we have noted from the evidence that a very serious doubt has been cast on Abdullah’s ownership of P31. We concur with the learned judicial commissioner, therefore, that no great reliance can be placed on the above.\n",

      "relevant paragraphs:\n",
      " For the reasons given above, we were of the view that there were no merits whatsoever in the appeals and we therefore dismissed them. Counsel for the first appellant raised substantially only two grounds of appeal. Firstly, that the trial judge had not given proper consideration to the first appellant’s defence that he was merely an innocent carrier and a “fall guy” for the conspiracy between the second appellant and Ram Babu to traffic in drugs. Secondly, that the trial judge erred in finding a common intention between the appellants to traffic in the drugs. We were of the opinion that the first ground of appeal was without merit. The trial judge rightly and properly rejected this defence. He found as a fact that the first appellant played an important role in the sale of the drugs to the extent that he determined the price and went to India to bring in the drugs. The trial judge disbelieved the first appellant’s evidence that he did not know English. There is absolutely no reason to disagree with the trial judge’s findings of fact on these matters, especially since he had the advantage of being able to observe the witnesses and to assess their credibility. We also reject counsel’s contention that the trial judge put words into Michael’s mouth that on the question of price of the drugs the second appellant conferred with the first appellant. The evidence was that when the issue of price came up in the negotiations between Michael and the second appellant, the latter would quote a price only after conferring with the first appellant in “an Indian language” which Michael admittedly did not understand. The evidence is therefore really irresistible that the first appellant played a role in the sale of the drugs to the extent that the second appellant had to confer with him before any price could be quoted. The trial judge found that the second appellant was not a truthful witness. Accepting Michael’s evidence as the truth of what took place at the two meetings in Mandarin Hotel, the trial judge found that it was the second appellant who principally negotiated with him in the sale of the drugs. His use of the words “thing” or “the things” served only to hide the truth which was that the meetings were with Michael and to sell drugs to him. The trial judge also found that the second appellant knew that the first appellant had with him ten cans of opium and two cans of diamorphine on 16 June 1990. The second appellant had consented to the first appellant carrying the drugs for delivery to Michael pursuant to the agreement to sell the drugs to Michael. The judge therefore held that the appellants had joint possession of the cans of opium and diamorphine. He was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants had together trafficked in drugs. At trial the Prosecution relied on ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”) which provide for the presumption of possession of the drugs in question and the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs. Reliance was also placed on s 18(4) which states that where one of two or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them. At the close of the prosecution case, the trial judge found that a prima facie case had been made out against both appellants with regard to the two amended charges and called upon their defence.\n",

      " Counsel for the second appellant took issue with the trial judge’s judgment on three grounds. First, he argued that the trial judge should have found that the Prosecution had not made out a prima facie case against the two accused. Second, he asserted that the trial judge had erred in failing to address the burden of proof upon the Prosecution of the second appellant’s guilt, ie proof beyond reasonable doubt. Third, he contended that the trial judge had erred in rejecting the second appellant’s defence. In his grounds of decision, the trial judge held that as the appellants had travelled by flight SQ57 from Hong Kong to Singapore and had the drugs strapped on them from Hong Kong until the time of their arrest, the actus reus of importing the heroin into Singapore had been established beyond reasonable doubt. He rejected the defence of the appellants that they did not know that they were carrying the prohibited drugs and that they did not know the destination of their flight from Hong Kong to Singapore until shortly before the plane landed. As regards the first appellant, the trial judge rejected the explanation that Ah Keung had asked him (the first appellant) to carry what purported to be tranquillizers in order to evade taxes. The trial judge did not believe that the first appellant did not know he was carrying heroin, given the manner in which the drugs were to be smuggled as well as the reward offered by Ah Keung. Furthermore, there was also no mention of the defence of tranquillizers in his cautioned statement. On the question of whether the first appellant knew he was coming into Singapore, the trial judge rejected his evidence that he only knew of this fact when the plane was just about to land. At the close of the prosecution case, the trial judge rejected the submissions of counsel for both the appellants that the appellants had no case to answer. He held that, on the evidence adduced by the Prosecution, a prima facie case had been made out against both appellants on their respective charges. The two appellants, both Hong Kong nationals, were jointly tried on separate charges of importing not less than 1,674.3g and 1,466.5g of diamorphine respectively into Singapore under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”). They were convicted and were sentenced to suffer death. Against their convictions they appealed. We dismissed the appeals and now give our reasons.\n",

      " Accordingly, we allow the appeal of the third appellant, set aside the conviction and acquit and discharge her. In our judgment, the evidence adduced as against the third appellant was much too scanty to warrant a finding that the third appellant abetted the first and second appellants in the commission of the offence by conspiring with them. In our judgment, there was no sufficient evidence for the court to infer any conspiracy between the third appellant and the first and second appellants in the sale and delivery of the drugs to Tan on 10 January 1993. The charge against her has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Here again, the trial judge has not erred in reaching this finding. The second appellant’s appeal therefore must fail and is dismissed. Even if such evidence is entirely excluded, there was ample evidence adduced before the trial judge which fully justified the conviction of the first appellant. Disregarding entirely the evidence of the earlier events and concentrating only on the events from 7 to 10 January 1993, we find that there was the following material evidence against the first appellant. First, there was the evidence of Tan on (a) his negotiations with the first appellant on 7, 8 and 9 January 1993; (b) the actions of the first appellant on the evening of 10 January 1993; and (c) the delivery of the bag that contained the cannabis. Next, there was the evidence that the $500 marked note given to him by Tan in part payment for the drugs was seized from him after his arrest. Thirdly, there was the cautioned statement recorded from him by the investigating officer in which he admitted to the charge. Lastly, although he did not carry the black bag that contained the cannabis, he was with the second appellant who carried the bag at the material time, and together they went and met Tan, and at Tan’s instruction, the bag was placed in the boot of Tan’s car. On the evidence adduced, he clearly knew that the bag contained cannabis, and under s 18(4) of the Act he was deemed to be in possession of the drugs found in the bag. Confronted with all this evidence, he had elected to remain silent; nor did he call any evidence in his defence. In our judgment, the charge against the first appellant has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. His appeal is plainly unsustainable and is dismissed.\n",

      " For all the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal. This argument had no merit, and we rejected it. The trial judge had carefully weighed the evidence in respect of each of the objections raised and found the objections to be without merit. We were not able to find any basis to say that the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence was faulty or that he erred in refusing to allow any of these objections. The trial judge was fully entitled on the evidence to accept the evidence of the investigating officer and the interpreter that they had taken time to go through the full process of reading, explaining and interpreting the charge to the appellant, that in explaining the charge to the appellant, they had interpreted the word “import” as “bringing heroin into Singapore” without any reference to the word “traffic”, and that the evidence did not support the appellant’s contention that her s 122(6) statement did not fully record all that she had said to the police. In any event, even if this statement was excluded, on basis of the evidence before the trial judge and his evaluation therefore, the appellant had not rebutted the presumptions under ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the Act. As for the second objection, the trial judge found that the interpreter had clearly testified that he had interpreted the word “import” as “bringing heroin into Singapore”, without any reference to the word “traffic” and held that he was satisfied that the charge was properly interpreted to the appellant and what was interpreted was sufficient to enable her to understand the charge that she faced before she gave her statement. None of these objections were sustained before the trial judge. In so far as the first objection was concerned, the trial judge held that he was satisfied on the evidence that sufficient time had been given to the appellant to enable her to comprehend fully the charge that she faced. He said that counsel’s argument was clearly at variance with the uncontroverted evidence of the investigating officer and the interpreter that they had taken time to go through the full process of reading, explaining and interpreting the charge and its nature and consequence to the appellant.\n",

      " Taken together with the statements which we decided were correctly admitted as well as the testimonies of the officers who were present at the material time, we were satisfied that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in drugs and had failed to rebut the operative presumptions contained in s 18 of the MDA. We found that the grounds of the appeal raised were without merit and accordingly we dismissed the appeal. Following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311, it is settled law that the burden rests on the appellant to prove on the balance of probabilities that he was not in possession and did not know the nature of the controlled drug which was contained in the bag. For the following reasons below, we were not convinced that the appellant had discharged his burden on the balance of probabilities. As regards the allegation of “you had better tell the truth”, it has been held in Lim Kim Tjok v PP [1977–1978] SLR(R) 403 that those words or equivalent expressions have always been held to import a threat or inducement. However, in a recent pronouncement of Chao Hick Tin JC, as he then was, in PP v Ramasamy a/l Sebastian [1990] 2 SLR(R) 197, the facts of each case have to be looked at individually. This was the position adopted by the House of Lords in DPP v Ping Lin [1975] 3 All ER 175 where Lord Hailsham stated that the question should be approached in a common sense way and in the context of the individual case. To this extent, we agree with the pronouncements of Chao JC and Lord Hailsham and find that, even if the allegation in the present case was true, we do not see how the expression could amount to a threat or inducement in the circumstances. Although those words were coupled with further statements to the effect that the appellant would be beaten up and sent to the gallows and verbal abuses which supposedly caused the appellant to shed tears, we are of the view that it was not sufficient to give the appellant any reasonable grounds for supposing that he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature by giving the statements. In any event, we would not disturb the trial judge’s finding that the appellant was lying and that there were no such threats or inducements as he had the opportunity to assess the demeanour of the appellant. We were not persuaded that the trial judge had made a wrong assessment of the evidence before him. In relation to both statements, the main complaint was that they were not given voluntarily but on account of an inducement or promise held out by both IO Cheong and Abdul Razak. The appellant was alleged to have been told that, if he should admit to the offence, he would receive a lighter sentence. Another complaint to that effect was that he was warned to tell the truth, otherwise he would be beaten up and sent to the gallows. Both IO Cheong and Abdul Razak were emphatic in denying that any promise or inducement was uttered.\n",

      " In conclusion, in our judgment, at the close of the Prosecution’s case, there is some evidence, not inherently incredible, which, if unaccepted, would establish all the essential elements of the charge against the respondent. His defence therefore ought to have been called. We have so ordered. Next, we turn to the s 121 statement made by the first accused, the material part of which has been set out above, and it is not necessary to repeat it. Briefly, it said that the third accused brought the respondent to the flat and through the third accused’s introduction the respondent sold a quantity of drugs to the first accused, for which the first accused paid the respondent the sum of $3,600. This statement is clearly a confession; and the trial judge has so found. Here again, this part of the statement is not inherently incredible in the circumstances. Thus, there is some evidence that the first and third accused, at the material time, had possession of the drugs with the knowledge and consent of the respondent. By selling and delivering the drugs to the first accused on the introduction and in the presence of the third accused the respondent had knowledge of and consented to the first and third accused having possession of the drugs. Hence, on the basis of this statement and the other evidence adduced, the essential elements of the charge have been established against the respondent. The test was approved of by this court in Chin Seow Noi v PP ([19] supra). In our opinion, having regard to the terms of the charge and reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made, the statement is a confession. The inference suggested by the statement was that the first accused was in possession of drugs. The content of this statement is not inherently incredible in the circumstances. That being so, there is evidence that the respondent took the drugs to the flat for packing and that the drugs were in the possession of the first and third accused at the time of their arrest. Thus, the first and third accused had possession of the drugs with the knowledge and consent of the respondent, and consequently under s 18(4) the respondent is deemed to be in possession of the drugs. Following from this, under s 17 all three of them are presumed to have the drugs in their possession for the purpose of trafficking. Whether a sale was contemplated or not at the same time is besides the point. This statement, if accepted, together with the other evidence adduced by the Prosecution establishes the essential elements of the charge against the respondent. Before we proceed further, it is necessary to focus on the charge that has been brought against the three accused. The charge in substance is that they, in furtherance of a common intention, had in their possession the quantity of diamorphine in question for the purpose of trafficking and by virtue of ss 5(2) and 17 of the Act trafficked in that quantity of diamorphine. In preferring this charge, the Prosecution has invoked s 34 of the Penal Code and ss 5(2) and 17 of the Act. All these provisions are well known and it is unnecessary to set them out verbatim. Suffice it here to say that the Prosecution relies on s 34 of the Penal Code to establish the liability of all the accused for the criminal act alleged to have been committed by one or more of them in furtherance of their common intention. The criminal act was the trafficking in the quantity of drugs. In proving trafficking in this case the Prosecution needs only to show that the accused had possession of that quantity of drugs at the material time. Once possession is proved, s 17 of the Act comes into operation and the accused are presumed to have the drugs in their possession for the purpose of trafficking, and unless this presumption is rebutted, under s 5(2) of the Act they committed the offence of trafficking. On the question of possession, the Prosecution relies on s 18(4) of the Act which provides:\n",

      " In summary, we are of the view that the trial judge correctly concluded that all the accused persons were guilty of the offences as charged owing to the overwhelming evidence against them as well as their inability to rebut the presumptions under the Act on the balance of probabilities. We are of the view that he had given due consideration to all the evidence before arriving at his findings. We see no reason to disagree with his decisions and accordingly we dismiss all the appeals. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from all the circumstances was that Yakoob knew of Lee’s drug trafficking activities. It was telling that Yakoob never enquired about the quantity of drugs to be deposited with him. He also claimed to find it strange that Lee himself did not hand him the drugs but that Choo was the one delivering it. Yet he insisted thrice that he could not simply refuse to take the bag and turn Choo away since the bag did not belong to Choo. This was allegedly only because Yakoob mentioned Choo’s name. Even though he felt frightened that the bag was so heavy, his first reaction was not to try to return the drugs to Choo or to keep the drugs in his locker. Instead, he walked into the “ZONE” shop to ponder over whether to keep or return the bag. Yakoob also chose to remain silent when called to give a cautioned statement, declaring that he had nothing to say. He claimed to have been confused and frightened. It did not occur to him to exculpate himself in any way and he also did not want to implicate Lee. Yakoob’s silence in the face of the weighty evidence against him permitted an adverse inference to be drawn, in the light of all the circumstances. Crucial aspects of his evidence were less than convincing and certainly fell short of discharging his burden of rebutting the presumption of trafficking. Accordingly, we dismiss his appeal. We shall deal first with the cases cited by counsel. It should be noted that the amendments to the Act in December 1993 have changed the complexion of s 17 and also introduced s 5(2). Thus, we do not see how the statements of the Privy Council in Ong Ah Chuan ([58] supra) could have any relevance in the current statutory climate. The definition of “traffic” in s 2 of the Act has not been amended. The Act itself makes no reference to “end-users” or promotion or distribution of drugs, apart from the fact that “distribute” comes within one of the seven definitions of “traffic” in s 2. There is no requirement that the person found in possession must be shown to be a “dealer” or “supplier” in order for the presumption of trafficking in s 17 to operate. There is also no requirement in the Act for any directly proximate connection between any particular end-user and an accused who is found in possession of a quantity of drugs which attracts the presumption of trafficking in s 17. R v Carey ([58] supra) appears to be factually analogous to the present case. The court’s reasoning may, however, be easily distinguished on the point that s 25(1) of the New South Wales Act makes the supply of prohibited drugs an offence. The relevant offence of “supplying” drugs, as defined in the Australian legislation, may carry the necessary connotation that there must be some element of provision, distribution or promotion of drugs. The same cannot be said of the local offence-creating provisions and the definition of “traffic” in s 2 of the Act, which are worded in quite dissimilar terms. As for Wan Yue Kong’s case ([59] supra), it must be emphasised that this case was decided within the framework of the existing law prior to the 1993 amendments. Counsel did not advert to the important fact that, in that case, the court expressly found that the Prosecution had not adduced any evidence to show that the first and second respondents were involved in any overt acts of trafficking. They were merely found in possession of the drugs and hence could only have been convicted of the offence of possession. In the present statutory regime, however, s 17 as it now stands would give rise to the presumption that the first and second respondents had the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, and unless they succeeded in rebutting the presumption, they would have committed the offence of trafficking in the drugs. Delivering the judgment of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, Hunt J was of the view that the above definition of “supply” did not include the mere transfer of physical control (ie return) of drugs to their owner or to the person reasonably believed to be the owner. As such, the defence of the accused was accepted and her conviction was quashed. Counsel also referred the court to PP v Wan Yue Kong [1995] 1 SLR(R) 83 in support of his contention that keeping drugs for the purpose of returning them to their owner would not constitute the offence of trafficking. In Wan Yue Kong, the first and second respondents were convicted on the lesser offence of possession of controlled drugs. They knew of the presence of drugs in the flat but the drugs were left there by one Loo Koon Seng (“Loo”) who was their rightful owner and who had intended to retrieve them from the premises. Based on his primary submission that “trafficking” must connote promotion or distribution of drugs, counsel contended that mere bailees like Yakoob were not truly intended to be captured by the scope of the wide-ranging presumptions in the Act. He cited the example of an unsuspecting cloakroom attendant who is handed a coat which he knows to contain drugs and later returns it to its owner with the drugs intact. He argued that the attendant is not trafficking drugs in the sense that he has not actively promoted the distribution of the drugs. He has merely returned them to the owner and is therefore not a trafficker in what counsel submits is the “true” sense of the word.\n",

      " In coming to my conclusion, I appreciated the fact that the respondent had been a very consistent witness. His long statement made shortly after his arrest and his evidence in court were substantially similar. Moreover, the independent evidence obtained by counsel for the respondent supported many aspects of his evidence. Nevertheless, I was of the opinion that the corroboration of his evidence and his consistency must be viewed with caution. The matters so substantiated, including the existence of Maung Maung, the Haroon Mosque, the McDonald’s Restaurant, the existence of Yusoof, the flight to Hatyai, the stay in Haadyai International Hotel and finally the flight to Singapore were features common to the operation of any smuggling outfit, whether of drugs or of gems. They were relevant to show that the respondent was a courier, which was in any event undisputed. However, these aspects were immaterial to the question of the respondent’s knowledge of what he was smuggling. As such, his truthfulness in these matters should not, in my view, be accorded undue weight when dealing with the question of knowledge. Accordingly, I would have allowed the appeal and convicted the respondent. The respondent, Hla Win, was acquitted of the charge of importing into Singapore 3,468g of diamorphine. His acquittal was appealed against by the Prosecution. At the conclusion of the hearing, I found the appeal to be of merit and was unable to agree with the majority decision to dismiss the appeal. The following are my reasons. It was not in dispute that the respondent was in possession of the bag and the bag contained the drugs, the subject matter of the charge. Accordingly, by virtue of ss 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the Act, the respondent was presumed to have the drugs in his possession and further, to know the nature of the drugs. The burden therefore shifted to the respondent to rebut the presumptions on a balance of probabilities. On this burden of proof, the learned trial judge had this to say ([1995] SGHC 65 at [64]): The respondent was acquitted of the charge of importing into Singapore not less than 3,468g of diamorphine, an offence under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”). Against his acquittal the Prosecution appealed. By a majority, with the Chief Justice dissenting, we dismissed the appeal. We now give our reasons\n",

      " There was, therefore, ample evidence against both the appellants. They had abetted Tan by conspiracy to export a large quantity of heroin to Spain, in consequence of which Tan attempted to do so but was arrested at the airport. Both the appeals were without merit and were dismissed. This submission raised two points for consideration. The first was whether the learned trial judge was right in postponing his determination of the admissibility of Goh’s statements until he had concluded the hearing of Ko’s voir dire. We think that generally it is desirable that a trial judge, having conducted a voir dire to determine the admissibility of a statement made by an accused, should at the conclusion of the voir dire make a ruling on the admissibility of that statement. That obviously is the most convenient stage to make the ruling. However, this is not an immutable rule. It is essentially a matter of procedure which is best left to the trial judge to decide. If a trial judge, in conducting more than one voir dire to determine the admissibility of statements of two or more accused, finds that it is more convenient to make the determination at the conclusion of all the voir dires, there could not be any objection to such a procedure. It is not vitally important at which stage he should make the determination. What is vitally important is that if the trial judge at the time when he makes the determination harbours any doubt whether the statement has been caused by any inducement, threat or promise, then he must exclude it, as in such a case the Prosecution has not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the statement has been voluntarily made. Hence, we do not see anything seriously wrong in the learned trial judge postponing his decision on the admissibility of Goh’s statements until the conclusion of Ko’s voir dire, although, quite candidly, we cannot see any reason why he could not have done so, and indeed should not have done so, at the conclusion of Goh’s voir dire. He found that the Prosecution had proved its case against all the three accused beyond any reasonable doubt and he convicted each of them on the charge they each faced. The appellants and one Tan Seng Kim (“Tan”) were jointly tried before the High Court on charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”). Tan was charged for attempting to export to Spain 226 rubber pellets containing not less than 871.77g of diamorphine and the appellants were both charged for abetting Tan in the commission of that offence. All of them were convicted. Only the appellants appealed against their convictions. We dismissed their appeals and now give our reasons.\n",

      " The next question is whether the presumption under s 17 arises, since possession of the drugs by Tan is established only by virtue of s 18(4). It has been decided in Low Kok Wai v PP [1994] 1 SLR(R) 64 that the presumption under s 17 would only arise if possession of the drugs has been proved, and it may be said that possession under s 18(4) is not possession that has been proved. In our opinion, the answer to this is twofold. Firstly, it has been proved that Tan had brought the drugs to the flat and sold them to Foong pursuant to an arrangement made by or through Lim. There is no question that Tan knew that what he had sold to Foong were drugs. His knowledge and handling of the drugs had been proved. It is true that at common law as he had sold and delivered the drugs to Foong, he no longer had possession of the drugs. But by virtue of s 18(4) and on the facts of the case he was deemed to be in possession of the drugs: he had knowledge of and consented to Foong and also Lim having possession of the drugs. In that sense, possession has been proved. Secondly, even without the presumption under s 17, there was sufficient evidence to show that the drugs were in the possession of all three of them for the purpose of trafficking. After the sale and delivery, ten sachets of drugs were packed from the quantity sold by Tan, and Foong went out to deliver them to George. There were 31 similar sachets also packed by Foong or Lim or both of them from the same source. The inference is that these were intended for trafficking. Tan was present throughout and could hardly say that he did not know the intended purpose of the drugs. It is true that as Foong was the only one who had bought the drugs and therefore he was the only one who was capable of trafficking in the drugs. Neither Tan nor Lim could do so, as the drugs did not belong to them. That however is immaterial. All three of them had possession of the drugs and the intended purpose of the drugs was for trafficking. It does not matter if only one of them would or could traffic in those drugs. Section 34 is an enabling provision, and it was invoked to render all three of them liable for the criminal act committed by one or more of them. If, however, the criminal act was committed by all of them then it is unnecessary to invoke s 34. In this case, even without invoking s 34, the Prosecution has proved the charge against all the three appellants, ie that they trafficked in the quantity of drugs in question. The basis for this is s 18(4) which states: Reverting to the facts, counsel submitted that clearly there was an absence of any pre-arranged plan which was a requisite in establishing the presence of a common intention. Further, assuming that all three of them had joint possession of the drugs, such joint possession does not amount to common intention to traffic in the drugs in question. Accordingly, there was no criminal act committed in furtherance of a common intention and the charge founded on s 34 was erroneous and all the three appellants had been wrongly convicted on the present charge. We turn finally to the issue of common intention. It was contended on behalf of all the appellants that there was not in existence the common intention entertained by all the three of them, in furtherance of which the offence they were jointly charged was committed, and accordingly an essential ingredient of the charge has not been proved. This argument was advanced principally by counsel for Foong, with whom the counsel for the other appellants associated themselves. His submission was briefly this. Assuming that the evidence adduced by the Prosecution was accepted, each of the three appellants had different intention at all material times. Before the drugs were brought to the flat, the intention of Foong was to buy the drugs, that of Tan was to sell them and that of Lim was to introduce and procure Tan to come to the flat and sell the drugs to Foong. After the drugs had been sold, Tan had no further interest in the drugs he sold and he merely remained in the flat to have a chat with Lim and was not engaged in repacking the drugs. Lim was engaged in repacking the drugs at the request of Foong. His intention was merely to assist Foong. Foong having bought the drugs became the owner thereof. His intention was to keep them for his own consumption and to sell a part thereof to George. Hence, at all material times, the intention of each of the three parties was manifestly different. They were not acting in concert at any material time and there was thus no pre-arranged plan.

      " In our judgment, there was no credible evidence that the appellant was then still suffering from any drug withdrawal symptoms which prevented him from applying his mind to giving the statement. On the basis of all the evidence before him, the learned trial judge was satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the appellant made the s 121 statement voluntarily. We agreed with the learned trial judge’s finding. The trial judge held that the appellant’s repacking of the heroin into smaller and identical packets and the presence of a weighing scale showed that the packets of heroin were for trafficking. The fact that there was a large amount of cash and jewellery found on the appellant, in spite of the fact that the appellant claimed he was unemployed, and his admission in cross-examination that he actually did not make any winnings in lotteries, all went to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was not just in possession of but also a dealer in the heroin. The trial judge therefore held that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking on a balance of probabilities and convicted the appellant. The trial judge found that the gist of the appellant’s defence was that: (a) he did not know the presence of the heroin and the other drug paraphernalia which were hidden in the false ceiling of Room 113; (b) it was Botak who checked into Room 113 on 28 December 1995; (c) Botak was the person who occupied the room all the time and consumed drugs there with his friends; and (d) he went there occasionally on the invitation of Botak, and at most he spent only three nights there as Botak’s guest. The trial judge, however, found on the evidence that Botak had been made use of by the appellant to check into Room 113 on the appellant’s behalf on 28 December 1994 using a false identity card. Thereafter, from that day the appellant had begun to occupy the room, the key being given to the appellant by Botak. The presence of the only key to Room 113 on the appellant, his oral statement to S/Sgt Thng, his s 122(6) and s 121 statements had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession of the heroin. The appellant was convicted of the offence of trafficking in not less than 75.19g of diamorphine contained in 67 sachets and two straws of substance on 9 January 1995 at about 1.45pm in Room 113 of Balestier Hotel, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).

      " Accordingly, we amend the charge as proposed and dismiss the appeal. The next question is whether the proposed amendment of the charge would operate to the prejudice of the appellant in any way. We think not. First, as we have said, the essence of the charge has been clearly spelt out, and the particulars of the charge have been set out in the charge and, apart from the reference to possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking and the reference to ss 5(2) and 17, are substantially correct. The material facts which have been narrated are not in dispute. It may be said that if the charge had initially been framed in the way as we now propose, the appellant might or would not have agreed to the statement of facts as admitted. But with or without that agreed statement, the Prosecution was in a position to adduce overwhelming direct evidence from the narcotics officers to prove that they saw the appellant carrying a white plastic bag and walking from the car park to the void deck of Block 614, Bedok Reservoir Road, at about 8.30pm on 17 February 1995 and that the appellant was arrested by the narcotics officers when he was about to deliver the white plastic bag to a male Chinese, a CNB informer. In his s 121 statement the appellant admitted that he had the white plastic bag at the time and he was on his way to deliver it to the male Chinese. The white plastic bag was found to contain two styrofoam boxes which in turn contained yellowish substance with a diamorphine content of 38.52g. There was therefore clear and direct evidence which established all the ingredients of the offence of drug trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the Act. Before we conclude we need to say a word with regard to the charge that has been framed. In essence, the charge against the appellant is for trafficking in the quantity of drugs concerned and the charge was made on the basis of the appellant having possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, and it refers to ss 5(2) and 17 of the Act. On this the Prosecution was in error. Section 5(2) should not be invoked in this case, as, on the agreed facts, the appellant was transporting and was in the process of delivering the white plastic bag containing the drugs to a male Chinese; his acts clearly fell within the definition of trafficking. As for s 17, it is, in any event, wholly unnecessary to make any reference to that section in the charge; indeed it is not necessary to refer to it at all in any charge under the Act, whether or not s 5(2) is invoked. It is an evidential section; it raises a rebuttable presumption of a certain fact and is no different from the other sections raising rebuttable presumptions of certain facts, eg ss 18–22 of the Act. Hence, even if s 5(2) of the Act is invoked it is still unnecessary to refer to s 17 at all. Having regard to the undisputed facts in this case we need to amend the charge (a) by deleting the words: “by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking” and substituting therefor: “by transporting for the purpose of delivery to a male Chinese”; and (b) by deleting the words: “by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act” and “read with s 5(2)”. The material facts in the instant case are, in substance, similar to those in Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311. There the accused, Tan Ah Tee and Low Hong Eng, were observed by narcotics officers walking towards a car near Block A, Far East Mansion, Kim Yam Road. Tan Ah Tee was seen holding a plastic bag and on approaching the car he was seen handing the bag to Hong Eng. They both went into the car: Ah Tee was the driver and Hong Eng the passenger at the front seat. Ah Tee drove the car all the way to Dickson Road where he stopped. At that point Hong Eng came out of the car holding the plastic bag. The narcotics officers then went up and arrested both of them. The plastic bag was found to contain 459.3g of diamorphine. Both were charged for trafficking in that quantity of drugs. At the trial, after the defence was called, both the accused did not give any evidence in their defence. They were convicted of drug trafficking and on appeal this court dismissed the appeal. Wee Chong Jin CJ referred to the contention advanced on behalf of the accused at [18] as follows:\n",

      " Even though we found that the trial judge erred in relying on the evidence of the paraphernalia found in the Ghim Moh flat as well as that of his previous trafficking activities, we were unable to disturb the conviction. It was patently clear that the trial judge would have been justified in convicting the appellant even had the challenged evidence not been relied on. The appellant had not rebutted the presumptions of possession and knowledge of the nature of the drug. These two elements of the offence were thus made out. He had also given evidence that he was in possession of the package so that he could hand it to M2. This was sufficient to convict without the evidence of the paraphernalia or the similar facts. As such, we were unable to hold that there had been a miscarriage of justice that would have justified quashing the conviction. Applied to the present facts, while due deference should be paid to the trial judge’s own judgment in these matters, we are nevertheless of the opinion that the balance was wrongly struck. The cogency of the evidence is not in doubt since, although the appellant had neither been convicted nor charged with those acts of trafficking, the source of this evidence was his own testimony. The relevance of the evidence is also not in doubt – it was pertinent to the mental state of the appellant when he was transporting the drugs. Where the objection to its admissibility arises is when we consider whether the strength of inference to be drawn from the similar facts is strong enough to tilt the balance. We think not. In Boardman, the House of Lords referred extensively to the test of “striking similarity”. It is now the position of the common law in England that this particular test is only one expression among many of the underlying principle. In R v P, the Lord Chancellor had this to say: While the plain wording of the Evidence Act does seem to adopt a categorisation approach to similar fact evidence, we think it quite clear, without deciding whether similar facts adduced for other purposes can ever be relevant, that at least where the similar facts are being adduced to prove one of the matters identified in ss 14 and 15, a balancing process must take place. Explanation 1 to s 14 states that the similar fact “must show that the state of mind exists not generally but in reference to the particular matter in question”. Illustration (o), in this respect, is instructive. The fact that a person has the habit of shooting at people with intent to kill is irrelevant where he is being tried for the murder of a specific person. The fact that he has previously tried to shoot the same person is, however, relevant. The illustration gives us some guidance as to how the balance should be struck. Similar fact evidence is always prejudicial. In the instant case, the fact that the appellant had previously trafficked in drugs, if allowed to exercise any influence on the mind of the trier of fact, would undoubtedly prejudice the appellant. It is only when the evidence corresponds materially to the present facts that the interests of justice demand that they be admitted. Be that as it may, we are of the opinion that the admission of similar fact evidence, at least for the purposes identified in ss 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act, should be governed by the balancing test adopted by the House of Lords in Boardman’s case. Such an approach is warranted both in principle as well as on the wording of the legislation itself. As to the former, it has been argued above that the rationale of the rule excluding similar fact evidence is so that every person charged with an offence may only be convicted upon being proved to have committed the acts within the charge. It would be subverting established jurisprudence to allow conviction based on the particular disposition of the accused – based on the contention that the accused is that type of person who would commit such an offence. On the other hand, there may be cases where the interest of justice clearly outweigh any prejudicial dangers inherent in the evidence. No doubt, in this jurisdiction, the trial judge being the trier of fact will have to be familiar with the similar facts in order to rule as to its relevance. However, we think ingenuous the argument that a strict enforcement of the similar fact rule is futile if the evidence has already been allowed to infiltrate the mind of the trial judge. All we say in response is that we are far more confident in the ability of judges to disregard prejudicial evidence when the need arises and we refer in this respect to the remarks of this court in Tan Chee Kieng v PP [1994] 2 SLR(R) 577.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, both appellants were rightly convicted of trafficking in 590.23g of cannabis and sentenced with the statutory penalty. Accordingly the appeal of both appellants is dismissed. It follows that the argument that the appellants were wrongly charged for trafficking in 832.3g of cannabis and convicted for trafficking in 590.23g of cannabis when they should have been charged for trafficking in 982.38g of cannabis mixture must fail. In our judgment, therefore, what Dr Lee’s evidence amounts to is that when he had broken down the compressed block of greenish vegetable matter which weighed 982.38g nett, only 852.35g satisfied the macroscopic and microscopic examinations he carried out for cannabis. The chemical tests were carried out on 590.23g of the 852.35g which showed the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol above the average of 0.5% and were proved to be cannabis. Since this was over the 500g of cannabis which attracts the death penalty no chemical tests were carried out on the remainder 362.12g, which had been returned to the investigating officer. In the circumstances the learned trial judge rightly amended the trafficking in cannabis charge from 852.3g to 590.23g. The “fragmented vegetable matter” being small broken pieces from the whole branches (intact branches), as Dr Lee explained in his evidence, did not conclusively satisfy him from the macroscopic and microscopic examinations that they exhibited the characteristic features of cannabis, but on chemical analysis, he detected the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol. All three tests must prove satisfactory to qualify the plant material as cannabis. As the “fragmented vegetable matter” had satisfied only the chemical test, Dr Lee certified it to be cannabis mixture, although strictly speaking the “fragmented vegetable matter” was not a “mixture of vegetable matter”, as we have already explained the scientific evidence clearly showed. It was composed of the same vegetable matter as the “intact branches” but failed to satisfy the macroscopic and microscopic examinations for cannabis. In all correctness Dr Lee should not have certified the “fragmented vegetable matter” as “cannabis mixture” and in our view should have certified that the “fragmented vegetable matter” did not satisfy all three tests he carried out for cannabis, although he found the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol in the “fragmented vegetable matter”. However this does not and could not detract from his evidence that 590.23g of the “intact branches” satisfied all three tests for cannabis.\n",

We do not find it necessary to refer to the other issues canvassed before us on the appeal. They do not bear on the defence of “own consumption” and in any case are not relevant or are without merit. We should, however, mention that an issue was raised that as the capital charge of trafficking was a “common intention charge” and the learned judge having acquitted the other conspirator, Tay Bee Hoon, the conviction of the appellant without amending the charge was irregular. True, the learned judge did not amend the charge; he found that the appellant alone was in possession of the 40 sachets of heroin and that he failed to make good that he was in possession of the 40 sachets for his and Tay Bee Hoon’s consumption. Suffice it to say that “s 34 of the Penal Code does not create a substantive offence; it lays down only a rule of evidence to infer joint responsibility” (per Thean J (as he then was) in Chota bin Abdul Razak v PP [1991] 1 SLR(R) 501). Accordingly there was nothing irregular about the appellant’s conviction on the capital charge of trafficking. In anticipation that the defence would be that the 40 sachets of heroin found by the CNB officers on top of the wardrobe in the appellant’s bedroom were for his own consumption and that of Tay Bee Hoon, and as already contended by the appellant in his investigation statement, the Prosecution called Dr Leow Kee Fong, the registrar of the Changi Prison Hospital to give expert evidence on drug addiction in general and with reference to the appellant in particular:\n",
      "(a)     The appellant was arrested on 14 July 1995 at about 6.00pm. He was admitted to Changi Prison Hospital on 15 July at about 3.30am for treatment of drug withdrawal. Dr Leow examined the appellant later at 9.15am. The appellant complained of cold sensation, gastric pain and vomiting. He had no diarrhoea. Dr Leow found that, clinically, the appellant’s condition was fair although he appeared lethargic and his pupils were dilated. He was also yawning, with tearing in the eyes and the presence of goose flesh. An examination of his ears and lungs showed normal results. Dr Leow treated the appellant symptomatically for gastric pain and vomiting. He was of the opinion that, clinically, the appellant was suffering from moderate withdrawal symptoms.\n",
      "(b)     Dr Leow examined the appellant again on 17 July. The appellant claimed that he had vomited the day before but this had now stopped. Dr Leow found that the appellant had goose flesh but otherwise he was normal. His pupils were back to normal. There was no dehydration, running nose or tearing of the eyes. The appellant’s condition had clearly improved.\n",
      "(c)     Dr Leow saw the appellant again on 18 July. The appellant had no complaints. There was no goose flesh. The appellant requested to be discharged from the hospital and Dr Leow finding his condition fair duly discharged him.\n",
      "(d)     However at 7.25pm the same day, 18 July, the appellant was referred back to the hospital for psychiatric assessment as the appellant had attempted to assault a CNB officer who was trying to record a statement from him.\n",
      "(e)     Dr Leow saw the appellant at 9.30am on 19 July 1995. He found that the appellant was not experiencing any drug-withdrawal symptoms. From this day to 1 August 1995 Dr Leow saw the appellant on a few occasions and on none of these occasions did the appellant complain of any drug-withdrawal symptoms and Dr Leow also did not find any evidence of the appellant experiencing drug-withdrawal symptoms. The appellant appealed on the conviction of the capital charge of trafficking. We heard his appeal on 23 September 1996 which we dismissed. We now give our reasons.\n",

      " In our judgment, the appellant was rightly convicted of the amalgamated charge, and we dismissed the appeal. The trial judge found that the drugs in the master bedroom and the second bedroom were in the appellant’s possession. He had not rebutted the presumption that he had the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. Consequently, he amalgamated the two charges into a single charge. The trial judge noted that a portion of the 22 sachets in the master bedroom might well have been intended for the appellant’s own consumption. However, there was no evidence that enabled that portion to be quantified. In any case, any adjustment would not affect the mandatory sentence in this case, bearing in mind the total weight of the diamorphine in the amalgamated charge. The appellant and Kua were jointly charged and tried in respect of the first charge and the appellant was charged and tried in respect of the second charge. At the conclusion of the trial, Kua was acquitted, and there is no appeal by the Prosecution against his acquittal. As for the appellant, the trial judge found that he had the two quantities of drugs, the subject matters of the first and second charges, in his possession for the purpose of trafficking and amalgamated the two charges into a single charge to the effect that he had in his possession for the purpose of trafficking not less than 491.19g of diamorphine and convicted him of that charge. Against the conviction the appellant appealed. We dismissed his appeal and now give our reasons. The appellant was convicted in the High Court on a charge of drug trafficking contrary to s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”). At the commencement of the trial, there were two charges preferred against him. The first charge was that on 2 August 1995, he and one Kua Tiong Ann (“Kua”), in furtherance of their common intention, trafficked in 17 packets of substance containing not less than 480.1g of diamorphine by having the drugs in their possession for the purpose of trafficking. The second charge was brought solely against the appellant, and it averred that he had 22 sachets of substance containing not less than 11.09g of diamorphine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.\n",

      " It was for these reasons that we dismissed this appeal. As for point (b), admittedly the tactics employed by the learned deputy public prosecutor at the trial (who was not the deputy public prosecutor at the appeal) were criticised by the learned trial judge but in truth the learned deputy public prosecutor could not be faulted. We have read the transcripts of the evidence and we are satisfied that the learned deputy public prosecutor was not attempting to supplement the Prosecution’s evidence or to withhold material evidence but genuinely desiring to impeach the appellant’s credibility as a witness in view of many inconsistencies in his evidence. We therefore see no substance in this point also. Finally, the learned trial judge invoked the presumption under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act that the appellant’s possession of the six packets of heroin in the white nylon sack containing not less than 294.5g of diamorphine was for the purpose of trafficking and convicted him as the presumption had not been rebutted. But the charge was one of “trafficking by transporting” and not of “trafficking by being in possession”. However that may be, no submissions were made to us that the appellant was transporting the heroin other than for trafficking. The gravamen of the appellant’s defence was that he was duped by Ah Poh into transporting the heroin and that when he discovered that what he was transporting was heroin and not spare parts as he was made to believe, he decided to confront Ah Poh and re-directed the taxi driver to proceed to Golden Mile Complex and not to People’s Park Complex. Presumably what the appellant intended was to return the heroin to Ah Poh and if this was so it would still be trafficking by transporting. See Tan Meng Jee v PP [1996] 2 SLR(R) 178; see also PP v Goh Hock Huat [1994] 3 SLR(R) 375. The appellant was convicted on a charge under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) of trafficking by transporting six packets of heroin containing not less than 294.5g of diamorphine in taxi SH 2894G from Bishan Street 22 to Ophir Road between 11.45am and 12.00noon on 19 July 1996. He was sentenced to death. We heard his appeal on 17 March 1997 which we dismissed without calling on the deputy public prosecutor. We now give our reasons.\n",

      " For the reasons given above, we dismiss Tan’s appeal but we allow Tong’s appeal. We acquit and discharge Tong. In our judgment, a prima facie case has not been made out against Tong at the close of the case for the Prosecution and his defence ought not to have been called. We would therefore allow his appeal. In PP v IC Automation (S) Pte Ltd [1996] 2 SLR(R) 799, the accused was charged with various offences of sales and/or distributions of infringing copies of the complainants’ programs under s 136 of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 1988 Ed). The evidence adduced by the Prosecution was wholly circumstantial. It was held that although it had been proved that the accused had in their possession infringing copies of the complainants’ programs there was no evidence of any sale or distribution and accordingly the learned magistrate held that no prima facie case had been made out at the close of the case for the Prosecution and he acquitted the accused. On appeal Yong Pung How CJ dismissed the appeal. The learned Chief Justice in the course of his judgment said, at [17]–[18]: Clearly, it was for this reason that the Prosecution amended the charge by enlarging the period so as to encompass the earlier alleged act of delivery of the drugs by Tong to found the element of common intention. The Prosecution says that at some point in time during the period between 11 January and 17 January 1996 Tong wrapped the drugs in ten bundles with newspapers and delivered them to Tan at his apartment and at the time of delivery there was in existence the element of common intention, ie to put Tan in possession of the drugs. If these facts were established, the case would be on all fours with Foong Seow Ngui ([20] supra) and the Prosecution would have proved the essential element of common intention. The question then is whether there is any evidence, not inherently incredible, which if accepted, would show that Tong delivered the drugs to Tan at a point of time within this period, ie between 11 and 17 January 1996.\n",

It would have a direct impact on his view as to the credibility of the appellant, especially in relation to his consumption of drugs. The appellant’s entire defence was totally dependant on the credibility of his testimony. If he was believed, then he would have discharged the burden placed on him by statute as against the subjective assessment of Dr Leow Kee Fong. The reasoning employed by the trial judge in evaluating the appellant’s evidence was flawed and the appellant therefore should be given the benefit of the doubt. This was an appeal against the decision of the High Court convicting the appellant of the charge of trafficking in one plastic bag, six sachets and five plastic straws of substance containing in total not less than 43.98g of diamorphine by having them in his possession for the purpose of trafficking at the common corridor on the ninth floor of Block 23, Chai Chee Road, Singapore on 22 December 1996 at about 3.55pm, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“the Act”).

What we have said in [9] above is a summary of those arguments. On 7 July 1997 we dismissed the appellant’s appeal against his conviction on a charge of trafficking in not less than 454.90g of diamorphine contained in ten packets of substance by transporting the same for the purpose of delivery to an unknown person at about 12.55pm on 3 August 1996 at Block 753 Yishun Street 72, Singapore, an offence under s 5(1)(a) and punishable with death under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).

      " For all these reasons we dismissed the appeal. In our view the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had possession of the drugs in question. This triggered the presumption of drug trafficking under s 17 of the Act. As the entire defence of the appellant centred on whether or not he was in possession of the drugs, once possession was proved, there was nothing to rebut the presumption of drug trafficking. Accordingly the appellant was rightly convicted of the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug, ie under s 5(1)(a) of the Act read with s 5(2). The essential question in this appeal is whether or not the Prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession of the drugs in question. Clearly in order to prove that the appellant was in possession, he must have physical control over the drugs. It is a matter of fact whether someone has physical control over an item. Here the storeroom was meant for the appellant and Sgt Soh. Only the appellant and the Sgt Soh were given the keys to the storeroom and the access to the storeroom was through the office shared by the appellant and Sgt Soh. The fact that Sgt Soh can gain access to the storeroom does not mean that the appellant did not have physical control over the drugs. We were satisfied that in this case the appellant had physical control over the drugs in question. Sgt Soh was absent on medical leave that day. Counsel for the appellant submitted that Tan and Kua may have known where the appellant kept the key to the storeroom and that the appellant was used to leaving open the window to his office. If it were the appellant’s case that Tan and Kua may have planted the drugs in the storeroom, then the mental element of possession will not be satisfied, but this will not affect our view as to whether the appellant had physical control over the drugs. Counsel for the appellant contended before us that the procedure was irregular because the effect of it was to place the burden on the appellant to prove that the s 121 statement was involuntary instead of the Prosecution proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the s 121 statement was made voluntarily. This reversal in the order of adducing evidence in the trial within a trial was highly prejudicial to the appellant and resulted in a mistrial of the admissibility issue of the s 121 statement.\n",

      " It was for all these reasons that we dismissed the appeal. We feel that in every case, depending on the circumstances, it is for the trial judge to use his discretion as to whether to order separate trials or to order a joinder of the offences. This is provided for in s 171 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (“CPC”). There are express provisions in the CPC to guide the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion. They are ss 169, 170 and 172. Therefore in all cases, the trial judge should bear in mind the rule of practice that a capital charge should not generally speaking be coupled with a non-capital charge in the same trial. However, if the trial judge feels that the circumstances of the case before him falls within one of the provisions of the CPC relating to the joinder of offences in the same trial and thinks that no prejudice is caused to the accused, it is open to him to allow the offences to be tried together even if one is a capital offence and the other is non-capital. It is of utmost importance that the trial judge must determine that no prejudice is caused to the accused. We take cognizance of this rule of practice and agree that it is a sensible rule of practice and is one that has been incorporated into our common law. We felt however that in the present case, the appellant had not suffered any prejudice by the joinder of the capital charge with the non-capital charge. Both the charges against the appellant were drug-related except that they were for different quantities, one being an amount sufficient to warrant the death sentence and the other not. We think that the trial judge was right in allowing the appellant to be tried for the two offences together and later for amalgamating them into one charge as there was a nexus in terms of proximity in time and location and both the offences also arose from the same set of facts. Furthermore, the standard of proof and the statutory presumptions are the same for the non-capital drug charge as for the capital drug charge. Both were offences under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Act. Only the difference in the quantities made one a capital charge and the other non-capital. The appellant submitted that the rule existed because a capital charge is too serious a matter to be complicated by having alternative counts in the same trial. The appellant relied on the cases of Lee Ah Cheong v R [1958] MLJ 242 and Cheng Seng Heng v Public Prosecutor [1949] MLJ 175 for this proposition. In Lee Ah Cheong v R, there was an appeal against the conviction and sentence of the offences of abduction and the using of a firearm with intent to cause physical injury. The main ground of appeal there was that the jury which tried the case was not summoned according to law. One other matter the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to in that case was the fact that counsel for the appellant had referred to the rule of practice stated in [41] above which was a rule of practice in England. The court felt that as this rule of practice had long been established in the English courts, it was desirable that it should be followed. This view had also been expressed obiter in Cheng Seng Heng’s case.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, we had no hesitation in dismissing the appeal. We noted that in the instant case, the twin presumptions under s 21 and s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act arose and were relied upon to establish the facts of possession and knowledge. The Prosecution could not therefore rely on the presumption under s 17 that the appellant had been in possession of the heroin for the purpose of trafficking, as the presumption under s 17 only arises where possession of the drugs has been proved and not merely presumed under ss 21 and 18: Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP [1995] 3 SLR(R) 689. The appellant contended that the trial judge had erred in admitting the appellant’s cautioned statement recorded on 10 January 1997 as the charge notified to the appellant when he made the statement was different from that which he faced at trial. The main differences lay in that the charge notified to the appellant when he made the statement referred to the gross weight of granular substance found (6,882g) whereas the charge he faced at trial referred to the nett weight of diamorphine (81.89g). Also, the charge notified to the appellant had been one of “trafficking” whereas the charge he faced at trial had been one of “trafficking by transporting”. We saw no merit in this contention. The cautioned statement was admitted so that the statements contained therein could be used to impeach the credit of the appellant under ss 147 and 157 of the Evidence Act, and not for the purpose of drawing an adverse inference under s 123(1) of the CPC from the appellant’s failure to mention particular facts in response to the charge set out in the notice to the appellant or in evidence of the charges against the appellant. The voluntariness of the cautioned statement was also unchallenged. The fact that the charge notified to the appellant when he made the statement was different from that which he faced at trial was therefore irrelevant. In any case, there were no material differences between the two charges. The charge the appellant faced at trial was in substance the same as that notified to him when the cautioned statement was taken, and we did not think that the appellant was misled or prejudiced in any way by the amendments to the charge. It is settled law that an appellate court will not interfere with a trial judge’s finding of fact based on the credibility and veracity of the witnesses whom the trial judge has seen and observed, unless the findings are clearly against the weight of the evidence and unsupportable: PP v Hla Win [1995] 2 SLR(R) 104. In our judgment, the appellant had failed to show that it would have been improbable or impossible for the narcotics officers to have seen what they claimed to have seen. It cannot therefore be argued that the trial judge’s findings were against the weight of the evidence and unsupportable. On the contrary, we were of the view that the trial judge was fully entitled, on the evidence before him, to prefer the evidence of the narcotics officers over that of the appellant. We would add that we refused an application by appellant’s counsel to adduce further evidence to refute the evidence of Cpl Ivan Tan and WNO Delphine Tan by the affidavit evidence of a witness who had since experimentally constructed the observation of a car at the multi-storey car park at Block 505 Bishan Street 11, Lot 118 Deck 3 under similar conditions to 7.05pm on 9 January 1997. Suffice it to say that this “evidence” would not have satisfied any one of the three Ladd v Marshall [1954] 3 All ER 745 tests.\n",

Even if the lies in his police statements did not corroborate his guilt, his testimony in court would still have been riddled with inconsistencies which affected his credit. There also remained the incredible version of his entering Singapore to deliver a motor car for rental. Since Ariff had to rebut the presumptions triggered, on the totality of the evidence against him, we took the view that this burden had not been discharged. Our earlier conclusion of his guilt therefore did not change despite the further evidence. Mindful of the Prosecution’s onerous burden of proof (no presumptions were triggered against Azman), we unanimously concluded that this burden had not been discharged beyond a reasonable doubt. Based on the circumstantial evidence (see Nadasan Chandra Secharan v PP [1997] 1 SLR(R) 118), we were unable to draw the inexorable and irresistible inference that Azman had abetted Ariff by having engaged in a conspiracy with him to import the drugs. Therefore, we had to ask ourselves whether the totality of the evidence against Azman was sufficient to prove the case against him beyond a reasonable doubt.

      " Appellant’s counsel obviously had not comprehended what the learned judge meant. What the learned judge meant was that if at the close of the Prosecution’s case the factual evidence of possession of the drugs was not inherently incredible, ie a prima facie case of possession of the drugs was made out, the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the Act would arise. But the Prosecution’s case, to warrant a conviction, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. So, possession, at the end of the trial, whether the appellant gave evidence or not, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If at the end of the trial possession was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt the presumption of trafficking, even if not rebutted, would cease to operate. This lack of comprehension led to defence counsel belabouring “the no case to answer” point. It is clear that this is what the learned judge meant for towards the end of his grounds of judgment he says: The learned judge dismissed the point as being one without merit but defence counsel persisted in it and it was also the main point of his submissions before us. In substance his submission was that P74 was a statement recorded under s 122(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. This could not have been further from the truth as ASP Chew’s evidence is crystal clear that the first lot of questions were asked of the appellant at the void deck on the ground floor of Block 438 immediately following the appellant’s arrest. The second set of questions were asked in the master bedroom of flat #04-1341 as soon as the appellant, ASP Chew and the escorting narcotic officers had arrived there and the appellant had indicated with his chin to the wardrobe as to where “the anything” was. It was plainly and simply a contemporaneous note of the oral statements made by the appellant immediately following his arrest, no doubt prompted by the questions put to him. “Investigation” as one understands it, in the context of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) or otherwise could hardly have begun so immediately following the arrest. In our view, the oral statements are relevant as they go to show that the appellant had the knowledge of the nature of the substances he was in possession of and form part of the transaction of being in possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking. They are therefore relevant and admissible under ss 6 and 5 respectfully of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (see Chi Tin Hui v PP [1994] 1 SLR(R) 313 at [27]). P74 was but a contemporaneous record of the oral statements. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death on a charge of trafficking in a controlled drug specified in class “A” of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1997 Ed) (“the Act”) by having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking at his flat at Block 438, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, #04-1341, Singapore, not less than 32.31g of diamorphine, without any authorisation under the Act or the regulations made thereunder, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Act.

In his cross-examination, the appellant made a reversal of his earlier evidence, and admitted that the evidence he had put up during his examination-in-chief was made up by him. Although the appellant’s admission of lying affected the appellant’s credibility, it was not safe to rely on it as supporting evidence for either Cpl Shadikin or Mohd Khermi’s identification evidence. An admission from the appellant that he told lies about where he was at the material time does not by itself prove that he was the one who placed the black plastic bag containing the heroin into the dry riser compartment at the Plaza. It is only where the judge is satisfied that the sole reason for the fabrication is to deceive him and there is no other explanation for its being put forward can fabrication provide any support for identification evidence. If so, the second question should be this. Is the identification evidence of good quality, taking into account the circumstances in which the identification by the witness was made? A non-exhaustive list of factors which could be considered include the length of time that the witness observed the accused, the distance at which the observation was made, the presence of obstructions in the way of the observation, the number of times the witness had seen the accused, the frequency with which the witness saw the accused, the presence of any special reasons for the witness to remember the accused, the length of time which had elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police and the presence of material discrepancies between the description of the accused as given by the witness and the actual appearance of the accused. In considering the circumstances in which the identification was made, the judge should take note of any specific weaknesses in the identification evidence. If after evaluation of the identification evidence, the judge is satisfied that the quality of the identification is good, he may then go on to safely assess the value of the identification evidence.\n",

Briefly stated, the charge against the first appellant was for delivering ten packets of drugs containing not less than 290.4g of diamorphine to the second appellant at about 7.55pm on 9 June 1997, an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1997 Ed) (“the Act”) and punishable under s 33 of the Act.

      " In the premises, counsel’s submission that the learned judicial commissioner had erred in drawing an adverse inference against the appellant for electing to remain silent without first satisfying himself that the Prosecution had made out a case which if unrebutted would warrant the appellant’s conviction was simply unsustainable. The failure of the appellant to call any evidence had the result that the confession of the first accused and the statement of Goh were not out-weighed by any other evidence in favour of the appellant capable of raising a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we dismissed this appeal. In other words, the court in deciding whether a case has been made out warranting the conviction of the accused will act on the presumptions that: (a) all evidence of primary facts is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and (b) there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or the state of mind of the accused that would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation: see the landmark case of Haw Tua Tau v PP [1981–1982] SLR(R) 133. L P Thean J (as he then was), delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Sim Ah Cheoh v PP ([53] supra) at [29]–[30], referred to Haw Tua Tau and thereafter clarified as follows: Counsel for the appellant had sought to argue in the court below that the learned judicial commissioner should adopt the approach to s 30 of the Evidence Act as enunciated in Tan Siew Chay v PP ([32] supra). This approach, which was also followed by the court in Sim Ah Cheoh v PP ([53] supra) and Ramachandran a/l Suppiah v PP [1993] 2 SLR(R) 392, was that the confession of a co-accused could only play a supportive role in a criminal prosecution and could not by itself form the basis of a conviction. It was therefore submitted that the learned judicial commissioner should consider the other evidence adduced by the Prosecution and only after that could he refer to the statements of the first accused. This line of cases (of which Ramachandran was the most recent) has, however, been overruled by the Court of Appeal decision in Chin Seow Noi v PP ([34] supra). The position now is that s 30 allows the conviction of an accused to be sustained solely on the basis of a confession by his co-accused, provided that the evidence emanating from that confession satisfied the court beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt. Although counsel for the appellant did not seek to advance the pre-Chin Seow Noi approach again before this court, we felt compelled to reaffirm that the correct approach to the application of s 30 was as stated by this court in Chin Seow Noi. In any event, s 30 was not of immediate importance in the present case. Although the confession of the first accused was crucial in implicating and convicting the appellant, it was not the only evidence relied upon by the Prosecution. There was also the statement of Goh and the circumstantial evidence, all of which when taken together were more than sufficient to justify the finding of the learned judicial commissioner that the Prosecution had made out a case which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction. On the facts of our case, there was no reasonable doubt that the appellant had abetted the first accused by conspiring with the latter to export the drugs. The evidence of the first accused taken together with the statement of Goh and the other evidence adduced by the Prosecution, were unambiguous and clearly implicated himself and the appellant. Indeed, the circumstantial evidence in this case alone more than justified the inference that the appellant had committed the offence with which he was charged. In a case such as the present, the question that the court must ask itself was stated succinctly by Huggins J in R v Chau Sau Tai [1969] HKLR 214, which is whether, in respect of each alleged conspirator, the court is satisfied that, on the evidence as a whole, he must have conspired with one or more of the others. The answer, in the present case, must be in the affirmative.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal of both Cheng and Sum and upheld their convictions. In light of the inconsistencies in, and the inadequacy of, Sum’s explanation as to how he came to be in possession of P93 and P98 and the reasons for his trip to Singapore on 22 July 1997, there was no basis for contending that the learned trial judge erred in rejecting Sum’s defence and in finding that the latter had failed to rebut the statutory presumptions operating against him under the Misuse of Drugs Act. We therefore dismissed Sum’s appeal. Thus, we dismissed Cheng’s appeal as the elements which constitute the offence of drug trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, namely, the accused (a) has possession of the controlled drug in question, (b) has done the act of trafficking in one of the forms set out in s 2 of the Act, and (c) has knowledge of the nature of the drug which he was in possession of (Tan Meng Jee v PP [1996] 2 SLR(R) 178), had been made out. In the present case, since Cheng was presumed to have had possession of the diamorphine by virtue of having been found in possession of P93 and P98 which contained the drugs (s 18(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act), the statutory presumption in s 17 that he had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking could not be invoked as it was not proved that he had the drugs in his possession (Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP [1995] 3 SLR(R) 689). It could, however, be inferred that Cheng had been transporting the drugs for the purpose of trafficking based on the alternative line of reasoning enunciated by Lord Diplock in Ong Ah Chuan v PP ([40] supra at [14]):\n",

      " We therefore concluded that all the elements of the offence with which the appellants were charged had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly we dismissed the appeal and confirmed the mandatory sentence of death passed on them. The Prosecution’s case was that the common intention of the appellants was to put the first appellant in possession of the drugs, pursuant to the prearranged plan of them both. The learned judicial commissioner found that the acts of both appellants went even further in that they resulted in both of them having possession of the drugs. We agree. Both appellants obviously knew that what they were handling were drugs, specifically, heroin. In the circumstances, there was simply no room for the argument that they lacked the requisite knowledge. Both had acted in concert in moving the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop. In addition, both had access to the shop in the form of the key to the door. They thus had physical control of the drugs. Both appellants had unpacked the drugs from the three sports bags and repacked them into one sports bag and a carton. They had also placed some drug-trafficking paraphernalia into the sports bag. The second appellant had returned to the shop on four separate occasions between 7 and 9 March 1998, the period when the drugs were stored in the shop. The conclusion that possession had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt could not be faulted. Counsel did not explain the relevance of the question whether it was Nor Azman or the first appellant who had asked the second appellant to move the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop, nor were we able to discern it ourselves. Surely it was immaterial whether it was Nor Azman or the first appellant who was responsible for asking the second appellant to move the drugs, as what was crucial was that the second appellant had indeed done so in pursuance of his common intention with the first appellant. This was not disputed. As for the other alleged inconsistencies, we did not think they were at all material. The train of events leading up to and resulting in the removal of the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. In this respect, the appellants’ statements essentially coincided on material points. We have already set these out at [65] above when dealing with the similar submission of counsel for the first appellant that there were numerous inconsistencies between the statements of the first and second appellants, and see no need to repeat what we have said here. We had no doubt that the first appellant had physical control over the drugs. He had access to the shop in the form of the key to the lock to the door. The oral answers given by him to Insp Krishnan in the shop on the day of the arrest showed unequivocally that not only did the first appellant know that the drugs and drug-trafficking paraphernalia were present in the shop but also the weight of the drugs in the sports bag and the number of packets in the carton. His long statement described how the drugs were packed. Possession had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.\n",

      " In the circumstances, a case of trafficking in 147.58g of heroin had clearly been made out against the appellant and the trial judge had in our view rightly convicted the appellant of the offence. Accordingly we dismissed the appellant’s appeal and confirmed the sentence of death. In light of the above, it was clear that the two contentions put forward by the appellant were totally without merit. On the other hand, the Prosecution had proven all the necessary ingredients of the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant was found to be in possession of no less than 147.58g of heroin, inclusive of the amount in the five packets of drugs contained in the grey Bata bag. There was consequently a presumption under s 17 of the MDA that the appellant had such drugs for the purposes of trafficking. Applying the law to our facts, we were of the view that the failure by the Prosecution to call SSgt Tai and Sgt Phao as witnesses should not lead to an adverse inference being drawn against it under s 116 illus (g). It was clear from our earlier discussion that the two named officers were not material or indispensable witnesses in the Prosecution’s case. The chain of evidence concerning the drug exhibits had been established beyond a reasonable doubt even without relying on their testimonies as there was other independent evidence in the form of Insp Goh’s testimony which would point conclusively to the fact that the drugs placed in the boot of the CNB car were those seized from the flat. The calling of the two officers would in the circumstances have been unnecessary and redundant and the failure on the Prosecution’s part to do so should consequently not lead to an adverse inference being drawn against it. We noted that counsel for the appellant did not contend that there were any further breaks in the chain of evidence during any other period of time. Indeed the evidence below shows no mishandling of the drug exhibits subsequent to the time they were placed in the boot of the CNB staff car. Insp Goh personally removed the plastic bag containing the drug exhibits from the boot after its arrival at the MIB and carried it to her office where she locked it up in her personal steel cabinet, to which only she had the keys. She also testified that there were no other drug exhibits in her cabinet at the material time since this was her first drug trafficking case. She also personally oversaw the weighing of the drugs and undertook the marking and sealing of the drugs herself, taking care to ensure that the drug exhibits were locked away as soon as the tasks were completed. She further personally handed the drug exhibits to Dr Lee of DSS for analysis. Dr Lee also properly stored the drugs in his steel cabinet pending analysis and, during analysis, found the seals to be unbroken. We further noted that the drugs seized and photographed at the appellant’s flat consisted of a total of 160 sachets, seven packets, one bowl and one phial – see para 5 of Insp Goh’s statement marked PS 19. The drugs re-marked and sent to the DSS for analysis also consisted of a total of 160 sachets, seven packets, one bowl and one phial of drugs. It was clear that the figures tallied down to the last sachet. In the circumstances, we were satisfied that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drug exhibits analysed by Dr Lee were the same drugs that were seized from the appellant’s flat. The defence of breach in the chain of evidence accordingly failed.\n",

      " In summary, the thrust of the arguments mounted above missed the point. Even if Raseed was an unreliable witness who failed to account for money in his possession, he was not under the burden of discharging any presumption raised against him. The matters raised by the appellant did not found any proper basis for the inference that Raseed was the true mastermind of the operation to the exclusion of Aziz. At most, it only suggested his complicity in the events. The court below was however not satisfied that this was proven beyond a reasonable doubt in the absence of compelling direct evidence implicating Raseed. In contrast, the direct evidence and incredibility of Aziz’s testimony weighed heavily against him. Accordingly, he failed on a balance of probabilities to rebut the relevant presumption. We wondered whether the learned trial judge ought to have amended the charge before convicting Aziz of the charge of trafficking by being in possession of the cannabis and the cannabis mixture. Counsel for Aziz did not suggest any prejudice to Aziz by the learned trial judge not amending the joint charge before convicting Aziz. In fact our careful perusal of the record of proceedings revealed that the mode of trial and Aziz’s defence were not prejudiced by the joint charge not being amended. In the circumstances the conviction of Aziz on the joint charge was perfectly proper. It will be remembered that Aziz and Raseed were jointly charged that pursuant to the common intention of them both they had committed the offence of trafficking in controlled drugs by being in possession of cannabis and cannabis mixture. At the end of the trial the learned trial judge found as a fact that Aziz alone was in possession of the cannabis and the cannabis mixture. Accordingly he acquitted Raseed of the joint charge as common intention had not been proved against him and proceeded to convict Aziz on the joint charge. Possession having been proved against Aziz, the presumptions under ss 17 and 18(2) then operate. There was also no challenge that the vegetable matter found in his possession were controlled drugs within the meaning of s 5(1) read with s 2 of the Act, namely, cannabis and cannabis mixture. Thus, subject to Aziz’s successful rebuttal of these presumptions, the Prosecution had established all the elements of the offence in question.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal. In view of the large quantity of drugs and the existence of paraphernalia commonly associated with trafficking, we were satisfied that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption under s 17 of the Act. Accordingly, there was no question in our minds that all the elements of the charge of trafficking under s 5(2) of the Act had been established and that the appellant was properly convicted. In the circumstances, we were satisfied that the appellant was in possession of the paraphernalia. He admitted in court that he knew of the existence of the electric sealer and digital weighing scale found in the living room, which he alleged were brought to the flat by Lau some three weeks before his arrest. Further, as we indicated above, we agreed with the trial judge’s finding that the appellant was the sole occupier of the flat. The trial judge therefore did not err in holding that the electric sealer and digital weighing scale found in the living room belonged to the appellant, as did the other paraphernalia found in the flat. In our opinion, the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the drug-trafficking paraphernalia found in the flat was in the appellant’s possession. However, before such evidence could be relied on, the Prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the paraphernalia was in the appellant’s possession (Tan Meng Jee v PP [1996] 2 SLR(R) 178). In the present case, the appellant’s defence was that these items did not belong to him. He claimed that the electric sealer and digital weighing scale found in the living room were kept at the flat by Lau for a friend, while he disclaimed any knowledge of the second electric sealer and digital weighing scale found in the kitchen, as well as the packet of empty plastic sachets. The trial judge did not believe the appellant’s claims. It was significant that one of the electric sealers, the one found on the shelf in the living room, was plugged into the power socket, indicating that it was being used. The appellant could only offer the lame explanation that when he saw the sealer, it was not plugged in. As for the digital weighing scale, it was found in the same plastic packet as the blue notebook which the appellant admitted belonged to him. The appellant also could not offer an explanation as to how they came to be found together. While none of the items, including the sealer and digital weighing scale found in the kitchen, were sent for fingerprint testing, this was not fatal to the Prosecution’s case. Insp Krishnan testified that in his experience it was practically impossible for fingerprints to be lifted off the surface of similar electric sealers. He also explained that the powders used in fingerprint tests would interfere with any trace of drugs which might be on the items.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the court below. Apart from the inherent improbabilities highlighted above, the appellant’s incriminating statements to the CNB officers clearly contradicted his assertions in court that the drugs had been placed there by Razak. He admitted to SSgt Rusdi that the drugs found in the car belonged to him and stated in his cautioned statement that he was solely responsible for the drugs. It was puzzling why the appellant would have made such admissions if indeed Razak was the one responsible for all the drugs. The appellant’s explanations were unsatisfactory. He alleged that the officers would not have believed him even if he had told them that the drugs did not belong to him. We were unable to find any logical basis for the appellant’s unilateral assumption that it would have been futile to deny ownership of the drugs. Even if the officers might have been sceptical about such assertions considering that the appellant had been caught red-handed with the drugs in the boot of his car, it was certainly unnecessary for the appellant to further claim in his statement to SSgt Rusdi that the drugs belonged to him if the truth was that Razak had placed the drugs in the boot. His other explanation for taking responsibility for the drugs in order to absolve his wife of any liability was equally unconvincing. As rightly pointed out by the trial judge, the appellant could have simply stated from the outset that the drugs were placed there by Razak without implicating his wife. In our view, the appellant’s failure to raise his defence until the trial seriously affected his credibility and rendered his testimony less likely to be believed. Hence, in our opinion, the trial judge was fully justified in drawing the irresistible inference from his various admissions that the appellant, being fully aware that the diamorphine was in the boot of his motorcar, had intentionally brought and therefore imported the diamorphine into Singapore. We found no reason to disturb this crucial finding of fact. It was undisputed that the appellant must possess the requisite actus reus and mens rea at the time the offence was committed before he could be convicted of the offence. Hence, if the appellant could raise a reasonable doubt that he did not know that the drugs were in the car at the time he entered Singapore, the Prosecution would not have proven its case. However, this is not an easy burden to discharge. The appellant did not deny that he had physically brought the diamorphine into Singapore. Thus, the sole issue on appeal was whether the appellant had intentionally imported the diamorphine into Singapore. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that there was a reasonable doubt that he was not aware of the presence of the drugs in the boot of the car at the time he arrived at Singapore and that he did not have the intention to bring the drugs into Singapore or that he did not do so knowingly. The defence counsel relied on the English case of R v Ingram [1975] Crim LR 457 where it was held that a defence of forgetfulness could effectively negative the element of mens rea in an offence for theft. It was submitted that the drugs had been placed in the boot of the car by Razak who subsequently alighted from the car without taking the drugs with him. The defence counsel further submitted that the appellant’s mind was so consumed with other thoughts at that time that he had failed to notice that Razak did not remove the drugs from the boot of the car. The appellant was allegedly distracted by thoughts of his appointment with Kamin, his squabble with his wife and his pending trip to the car repair shop. Thus, the first time the appellant remembered about the drugs in the boot was after his arrest at the Woodlands checkpoint.\n",

      " In the light of the foregoing reasons, we found the separate charges against the two appellants established beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore upheld the convictions and mandatory death sentences passed by the trial judge and dismissed both the appeals. In summary, we found that Boksenang’s allegations were self-contradictory and inherently improbable on the facts of the case. The evidence he gave to support his claims were inconsistent and the assertions were not otherwise sustained by objective evidence. On the other hand, Insp Muru’s evidence was clearly substantiated by the testimony of the interpreter, refuting the bare allegations raised by Boksenang. As the trial judge had the benefit of hearing and seeing the witnesses give evidence and was in the position to test their credibility and veracity in the witness box, the appellate court should be slow to disturb the findings that were reached by him. We saw no reason to depart from the findings made by the learned judge and affirmed his decision that the statement in P47 was made voluntarily and was admissible as evidence. After reviewing the evidence, the trial judge reached the finding that the alleged statements were never made by Insp Muru to procure the making of P47. He observed that Boksenang was not entirely consistent in his complaints and in the course of the voir dire, he even sought to embellish his allegations, adding that Insp Muru had also threatened him with indefinite detention if he failed to cooperate, even though this serious allegation was never mentioned before and neither was it put to Insp Muru or the interpreter. In the course of his oral testimony in the voir dire, Boksenang also gave somewhat contradictory accounts of how the recording of P47 took place. At first, he claimed that Insp Muru did not tell him what to say and would ask questions which he would then answer. However, he later said that Insp Muru had taught him the contents of nearly the whole statement and that Insp Muru was the one who provided the answers to the questions, which formed the details in the statement. In addition, although Boksenang alleged that he was compelled by Insp Muru to make a statement that was consistent with those made by Sharom, a careful perusal of P47 showed that it was not actually consistent since Sharom’s account of the events that took place on 19 March 1999 (Friday) at the Jelapang flat had significant differences from Boksenang’s version. This did not gel with Boksenang’s claim that he made P47 to satisfy the demands for consistency with and corroboration of Sharom’s statements. Furthermore, Sharom’s statements were all recorded before Boksenang’s first statement was even taken, therefore if Insp Muru had wanted consistency with Sharom’s statements, he could have demanded for it in Boksenang’s earlier statements and not wait until his third long statement. In any case, we noticed that his earlier statements were not contradictory to the events as recorded in P47 as all the statements each dealt with distinct events. Hence, there appeared to be little reason for Insp Muru to be displeased with Boksenang’s earlier statements, as was suggested, such that he had to resort to the use of inducement, threat or promise to procure P47 when none had been necessary in the recording of the earlier statements. The promise to procure a reduced charge would also amount to an obvious inducement to give a good statement in exchange for a non-capital charge. In Poh Kay Keong v PP ([47] supra), the court was of the view that if such a promise had indeed been made, it would have been clear enough to vitiate the confession. The same would apply for a threat of indefinite detention, which could certainly induce an accused to confess in order to avoid the punishment of prolonged confinement. On the other hand, we did not think that the same could be said of a mere reference to statements made by a co-accused, an accomplice or even a witness. It was argued by counsel for Boksenang that Insp Muru’s reference to Sharom’s statements during the recording of P47 induced Boksenang to make the statement when he would not have done so otherwise. We were unable to agree with this contention. It was difficult to see how an accused person could perceive gaining any advantage or avoiding any evil by making a self-incriminating statement simply because he was told what his co-accused had said. On the contrary, it would seem proper that the accused should be kept informed of what kind of allegations have been made against him by other accused persons or witnesses so that he may properly defend himself against such allegations. Indeed, references to such other statements would assist the accused in deciding on what he should say to best present his defence and therefore should not be regarded as an inducement rendering the statement involuntary.\n",

Nothing was raised in the court below and nothing raised on appeal which rebutted the s 17(c) presumption of drug trafficking triggered by the proof of the appellant’s possession of not less than 130.46g of diamorphine. For these reasons, we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the sentence. The appeal contested the trial judge’s finding that these two elements of possession were satisfied. In respect of physical control, the appellant argued that the trial judge erred in failing to give due weight to the fact that the appellant did not have exclusive possession of the flat and that there were visitors who went to play mahjong at the flat who could have entered the storeroom. We had several difficulties with this argument. The appellant was charged with trafficking in a controlled drug, an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”). Section 5(2) of the Act states that a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. Section 17(c) of the Act provides a presumption concerning trafficking. It states that any person proved to have possession of more than 2g of diamorphine shall be presumed to have that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose. The appellant’s assertion of total ignorance of the contents was rejected by the trial judge. In the trial judge’s view, the circumstances in which the appellant came into possession of the bag, if true, were so suspicious that it would require a totally mindless person to have done what the appellant claimed he did. Even if he did not suspect anything illicit, he surely would have enquired from Ah Beh or his two associates what the contents were. He would have needed to know if the contents were fragile or perishable in order to discharge his duties responsibly. At the least, he would have opened the bag for a peek, for it was not as if he had been instructed not to look. He did not bother to ask why the bag should be kept by him for a few days. All of this was compounded by the fact that the owner of the bag was not only someone unknown to him, but a former prison inmate. The trial judge therefore found that the appellant clearly knew that what he was receiving and keeping was a controlled drug.\n",

      " In this case, possession of 32.27g of diamorphine was proven beyond reasonable doubt. The presumption under s 17 MDA was triggered. The appellant’s election to remain silent, refusal to call any witnesses, failure to explain his possession of the drug and to present final submissions at the trial, made it impossible for him to discharge the burden of rebutting the presumption against him, or to cast reasonable doubt on the case. There was no compelling reason to fault the trial judge’s decision to admit the three long statements. For the above reasons, we dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction and sentence. In the circumstances, both the appellant’s physical possession of the haversack that contained the drug, as well as the appellant’s knowledge of the content of the haversack were proven beyond reasonable doubt. The statutory presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking under s 17 MDA was triggered. That made out the offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) MDA. The appellant’s silence and failure to adduce any evidence to show that the drug was not for the purpose of trafficking necessarily meant that a guilty verdict was amply justified. Counsel’s submission that the trial judge erred in drawing an adverse inference against the appellant was unsustainable. As seen in Murray v Director of Public Prosecutions [1994] 1 WLR 1 and Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP [1998] 3 SLR(R) 619, a proper inference under s 196(2) CPC included the drawing of an inference that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged. The trial judge would necessarily have borne in mind whether taking into account all the other circumstances, a guilty inference was justifiable. As evinced in Murray and Haw Tua Tau ([46] supra), it is a common-sense test. Intervention by an appellant court would only be exercised if it was obvious from the records that such negative inference was unjustifiable or unreasonable. There were objections to the admissibility of the evidence in these three statements. Voluntariness was made an issue. A voir dire ensued. On this, the law is settled, as seen in various authorities such as Gulam bin Notan Mohd Shariff Jamalddin v PP [1999] 1 SLR(R) 498, Seow Choon Meng v PP [1994] 2 SLR(R) 338 and Poh Kay Keong v PP ([20] supra). The Prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statements were made voluntarily. Section 24 of the Evidence Act governs the admissibility of the statements made to the CNB officers.\n",

      " In the light of the above, we found that the Prosecution had proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt and that the appellant was rightly convicted. We therefore dismissed the appeal. Even if it could be successfully argued that the Prosecution had failed to prove that the appellant had knowledge that the 32 slabs of substance contained opium, the appeal would still fail. The appellant was seen by the CNB officers driving his car from Dover Road to Jalan Kukoh, and at Jalan Kukoh when he was about to pick up Ang, he and Ang were arrested. At the time of his arrest, the officers found in his car 32 slabs of substance which, subsequently on analysis, were found to contain 49,168g of opium containing 990.05g of morphine. On these facts, the appellant was not only in physical possession of the drugs. He was doing more than that. He was transporting the drugs from a point unknown to Dover Road and from Dover Road to Jalan Kukoh and was in the process of delivering the drugs to various persons, including Ang. This was not a case of passive possession of the drugs on the part of the appellant, but one where the appellant was found to be transporting or delivering the drugs. On these facts, there was no necessity for the Prosecution to invoke s 5(2) of the Act and rely on the presumption under s 17 that the appellant at the material time had possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. On these facts, the Prosecution could have preferred a charge under s 5(1)(a) of the Act that the appellant trafficked in the quantity of opium by transporting or delivering it. If the Prosecution had done so, it could invoke the presumption under s 18 of the Act that the drugs were in the possession of the appellant as the owner of the car or as the person in charge of the car at the material time. In such a case, the possession of the drugs would be presumed and not proved. This presumption would operate against the appellant, and the burden would then rest on the appellant to rebut this presumption, on a balance of probabilities. In that the appellant had failed. The learned judge rejected his evidence that he did not know the contents of the 32 slabs of substance. We agreed with the learned judge. The appellant in his evidence sought to show that he was an innocent courier engaged by one Ah Seow to deliver “the goods” for a sum of $500. Purely on the basis of his evidence, the entire course of dealings between him and Ah Seow was gravely suspect. For a start, the appellant had only met Ah Seow once before he was engaged by the latter to deliver the goods in question. He was engaged by Ah Seow on the evening of 10 April 1999 (the day before his arrest), and at that time Ah Seow was for all intents and purposes a stranger to him. Having been so engaged by Ah Seow, he met up with Ah Seow, and trustingly allowed Ah Seow to load the bags of substance into the trunk of his car, apparently without even asking about their contents or checking them. While the bags were being loaded into the car he found that some smell was emitting from the bags; yet he did not check or ask what the goods were. He said that he thought they were herbs. After the bags were loaded, Ah Seow gave no clear and specific instructions as to the addresses of the persons to whom the bags were to be delivered. Instead he was given a slip with cryptic numbers or messages for delivery. Further, Ah Seow for some inexplicable reasons only gave instructions later as to the addresses of the persons to whom the deliveries were to be made. In these circumstances, it would have been obvious to even the most naïve of persons that there was something highly illicit in the goods he was asked to deliver. In this case, the appellant at the time of his arrest was found to have in his control the 32 slabs of substance, and that was proved by the Prosecution and was not disputed in the defence. It was also proved, and also not disputed that the 32 slabs of substance contained 49,168g of opium containing not less than 990.05g of morphine. What was clearly disputed, which the Prosecution had to prove, was the element of mens rea, ie that the appellant knew that the 32 slabs of substance contained opium. Only when that element was proved, would the presumption under s 17 of the Act arise, and the burden would then be on the appellant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the quantity of opium in his possession was for purposes other than trafficking.\n",

      " For the reasons we have given, we agree with the findings of the judge that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Suboh, at the material time, had physical custody of the drugs as well as the requisite mens rea, ie that he knew that the blue bag found in the flat contained the drugs. The Prosecution therefore had proved that Suboh had possession of the drugs, and as the quantity of the drugs in his possession exceeded 2g of diamorphine, there arose the presumption under s 17(c) of the Act that he had possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, and no evidence had been adduced by Suboh to rebut this presumption. Consequently, by reason of s 5(2) of the Act, he committed the offence of trafficking. Accordingly, Suboh’s appeal is also dismissed. We now turn to consider whether the Prosecution has proved that Suboh had possession of the drugs. In discharging this burden, the Prosecution has to prove (a) that Suboh had physical custody of the quantity of substance, and (b) that he knew that the quantity of substance contained drugs: Fun Seong Cheng v PP [1997] 2 SLR(R) 796, Su Chee Kiong v PP [1999] 1 SLR(R) 142 and Gulam bin Notan Mohd Shariff Jamalddin v PP [1999] 1 SLR(R) 498. In this appeal it is essential to bear in mind what the charge was that was brought against Suboh. The charge against him was that he had possession of the drugs in question for the purpose of trafficking, and under s 5(2) of the Act he thereby committed the offence of trafficking in the drugs. To make good this charge the Prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Suboh had possession of the drugs at the material time: Low Kok Wai v PP [1994] 1 SLR(R) 64, PP v Wan Yue Kong [1995] 1 SLR(R) 83 and Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP [1995] 3 SLR(R) 689. Once this burden is discharged, the presumption under s 17(c) that he had possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking is triggered, and the burden is then on Suboh to show on the balance of probabilities that the drugs were for purposes other than trafficking. At any rate, even if the judge had rejected Salam’s evidence on the ground that Salam was untruthful and unreliable, and convicted Salam of the charge, we do not see how such a result would or could have any effect or impact on the defence of Suboh. It certainly would not exonerate him from the charge. Salam’s lies, which were relied on heavily in the argument by Suboh’s counsel, concerned only Salam himself and does not impinge on Suboh’s defence or guilt. The judge certainly did not rely on Salam’s lies to convict Suboh. The evidence of Salam on which the judge relied in acquitting him has no bearing on the defence of Suboh in relation to the charge.\n",

      " In our judgment, the evidence against the appellant was overwhelming, and the trial judge’s finding that the charge against the appellant had been proved beyond reasonable doubt was fully supported by the evidence. We agree with his finding. We therefore dismiss the appeal. As regards the statement of facts, P46, he initially admitted, then denied that the statement of facts was read to him when he pleaded guilty to the drug trafficking charges. He admitted that the charges were read to him and that he had pleaded guilty to the charges against him but was not able to remember the subsequent proceedings; specifically, he could not remember whether he had admitted to the statement of facts. When he was asked by the trial judge, he confirmed that whatever he pleaded guilty to or admitted to was done out of fear. However, he conceded that the charges against him were true but asserted that the contents of P46 was untrue. When he was questioned by defence counsel, he agreed to the suggestion that he was prepared to admit to the statement of facts in order to escape the gallows, and was not concerned about the truth of the contents after the charges against him were reduced. When confronted with the statements, Katheraven proffered various explanations for the contradictions, and he retracted the material parts of the statements which implicated the appellant. He testified that he gave the statement, P29, in fear as the investigating officer told him that he would be hanged. He readily agreed to a suggestion to implicate the appellant as he wanted to save himself from the gallows, and to induce the investigating officer to believe him. He admitted, however, that the investigating officer had not promised him anything in exchange for implicating the appellant. When he was questioned further, he explained that the only reason he subsequently implicated the appellant in P29 was because he was afraid that something might happen to him. When he was pressed further as to why he chose to implicate the appellant, he explained that this was because “he’s my friend” and “[b]ecause he was arrested and taken to MIB with me”. Mr Sidambaram submits that the statement was pre-prepared and was brought to Katheraven while he was in the lock-up in the Supreme Court immediately after he had pleaded guilty to the charges, that Katheraven signed it out of fear and that he signed the statement even though the contents were false, and that at that time Katheraven would have signed any document placed before him. For this reason, he submits that P49 is unreliable and no weight should be attached to that document.\n",

      " In light of our findings above, we found that the judicial commissioner rightly convicted Ramis of the offence as charged. We therefore dismissed the appeal against conviction and sentence. Since it was our decision that Ramis had both physical control and knowledge of the drugs, we found that the element of possession was satisfied. The presumption under s 17 of the Act as to the purpose of possession then kicked in. Thus, by s 17(d) of the Act, he was presumed to have had the cannabis in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. This presumption had not been rebutted by Ramis. However, before the Prosecution could rely on this presumption, it first had to prove the element of possession. The meaning of “possession” was discussed by Lord Pearce in Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 2 AC 256, and followed by this court in the case of Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311. A long line of cases has since followed the ruling in these cases. Essentially, in order to prove possession, the Prosecution had to satisfy two elements: firstly, it had to prove that Ramis had physical control of the cannabis and, secondly, that Ramis knew that what he had under his physical control was cannabis: see Lee Lye Hoe v PP [2000] SGCA 55, Zulfikar bin Mustaffah v PP [2001] 1 SLR(R) 181 and Lim Beng Soon v PP [2000] 3 SLR(R) 213. To discharge its burden of proof, the Prosecution had to prove possession of the drugs on the part of Ramis for the purposes of trafficking.

      " For the above reasons, we dismissed the appeal. The reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the above observations was that the appellant’s story as to how he came into possession of the bag was obviously cooked up to distance himself from any knowledge that he might have had as to the bag’s contents. We were more inclined to draw the inference that the appellant knew what the five bundles contained. Such an inference would be supported by the fact that, at the time of his arrest, the appellant was found to be in possession of $4,890 in cash, denominated in S$10 and S$50 notes. His explanation that these were the proceeds from his gambling winnings was ridiculous. Firstly, it is highly unusual for an unemployed man to go around carrying such large amounts of cash in his pocket. Secondly, he claimed to have won the moneys two to three weeks before his arrest, so that did not explain why he was still carrying the moneys on the day he was arrested. Even Choo JC was still “not entirely satisfied with his account of how he came into such large sums of money given his financial and job records”. Rather, a more plausible deduction would be that the cash found on the appellant was payment for him to act as a courier for the five bundles. If this deduction were correct, then the appellant’s claim that he did not know what the five bundles contained would, in light of the large sum of money involved, be rendered a lot more difficult to believe. For the element of “possession” (within the meaning of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act) to be established, it must not only be shown that the accused had physical control of the drugs at the relevant time; the Prosecution must also prove that the accused possessed the requisite knowledge as to the contents of what he was carrying: see Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 2 AC 256; Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311. In the course of the appeal before us, counsel for the appellant relied heavily on the fact that the contents of the bundles were securely wrapped in newspapers and could not be identified. We were accordingly invited to draw the inference that the appellant had no knowledge of the contents of the bundles. Consequently, Choo JC held that the charge against the appellant had been made out. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to suffer the death penalty.\n",

      " It seemed to us clear that on the basis of statements C, D and E, the movements of Malik at Block 109 that fateful afternoon, and the confessions of Norazmi which unequivocally implicated Malik (which statements were admissible against Malik under s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed), as interpreted by this court in Chin Seow Noi v PP [1993] 3 SLR(R) 566), there was ample evidence to warrant the trial judge finding that it was Malik who placed the plastic bag with the drugs beside the abandoned washing machine on the ninth floor and that he was thus in possession of the drugs. Possession having been proven, he was presumed under s 17 to have the drugs for the purposes of trafficking. The charge was therefore established. In the premises, the findings and the verdict recorded by the trial judge were correct and should be upheld and which we did. In this appeal, besides reiterating the point that statement B (second part) and statements C and D should not have been admitted into evidence on the ground that they were not made voluntarily, and which we have dealt with above, what counsel for Malik basically argued was that the version of events as recounted by Malik in court was credible, or, at the very least, he had raised a reasonable doubt, particularly in the light of the fact that Norazmi had admitted at the trial that all the drugs belonged to him and that Malik had no connection with drugs. Norazmi also confirmed that he did borrow money from Malik for gambling. In the result, we agreed with the finding of the trial judge that the cautioned statement was admissible. Malik had failed to raise any reasonable doubt in relation to both the objective and subjective requirements in order to successfully plead that the statement was not given voluntarily. The appellant, Abdul Malik bin Abdul Jamil (“Malik”) was tried and convicted of the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug, namely, that he had on 31 January 2001, in his possession for the purpose of trafficking not less than 31.91g of diamorphine, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1998 Ed) and punishable under s 33 of the Act. Another person, Norazmi bin Morsit (“Norazmi”) was also jointly tried with him and Norazmi was convicted of aiding and abetting the appellant in the commission of the offence. Norazmi withdrew his appeal against his conviction and sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing of the appellant’s appeal, we dismissed it. We now give our reasons.\n",

      " As the appellants were not able to establish that the trial judge erred in convicting them, their appeals were dismissed. As far as Syed’s statements to the CNB are concerned, it ought to be reiterated that an accused person’s confession, though retracted, can be used against a co-accused so long as the court is satisfied after taking into account the explanation given for the retraction, that the confession is true and that it was made voluntarily. This was made clear by this court in PP v Rozman bin Jusoh [1995] 2 SLR(R) 879 and Panya Martmontree v PP [1995] 2 SLR(R) 806. Needless to say, there is a question as to the proper weight to be ascribed to the statement of one accused who implicates the co-accused. We are satisfied that the trial judge gave this question sufficient attention and see no reason to disagree with his conclusion. The other arguments advanced by the appellants against their conviction also lacked merit. Syed asserted that the trial judge failed to direct himself sufficiently on the issue of common intention under s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). We were satisfied that the trial judge, who relied on, inter alia, the decision of this court in Foong Seow Ngui v PP [1995] 3 SLR(R) 254 and other cases, including Mahbub Shah v King-Emperor (1945) 47 Bom LR 941 and Barendra Kumar Ghosh v Emperor AIR 1925 PC 1, carefully considered the applicable principles and case law on common intention. The judge was clearly right when he concluded that, on the basis of the finding that Syed and Roetikno handled and repacked the drugs in Room 406 of Taipei Hotel at the material time, they were in possession of the drugs in furtherance of the common intention to traffic in them. The admissions made by Syed and Roetikno in their statements to the CNB were undoubtedly confessions of their guilt. In innumerable cases, including Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP [1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 and Anandagoda v R [1962] MLJ 289, it was made clear that the test as to whether or not a statement is a confession is an objective one. It depends on whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstances in which it was made, it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or suggest the inference that he committed the offence (per Lord Guest in Anandagoda (supra at 291). An accused person who retracts during his trial a confession he made earlier on can still be convicted on the basis of the confession if the court is satisfied that it was made voluntarily and that it was true.

His conclusions could not be impugned. In our view both the appellants were knowing and willing participants in the crimes for which they were charged. Consequently, we dismissed their appeals. Despite Steven Ang’s attempts to exonerate Lim we found no reason to disturb the inferences drawn and conclusions reached by the trial judge in the present case.

      " We were of the view that Tay J was correct to have convicted the appellant. Firstly, the Prosecution had proved that the appellant had in his possession and control the keys to the flat and to the rented room. Thus, s 18(1)(c) of the MDA applied and the appellant was presumed to have had the drugs in his possession. Secondly, because he was presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession, s 18 (2) of the MDA applied. Thus, he was then presumed to have known the nature of the drugs (ie cannabis). Thirdly, the Prosecution proved that the drugs in the appellant’s possession were meant for the purposes of trafficking. The sheer quantity of the drugs (not less than 2,715.6g of cannabis) and the drug trafficking paraphernalia found in the flat went to prove that the drugs were meant for the purposes of trafficking. Fourthly, as regards s 5(1)(a) of the MDA, the trafficking of the drugs was not authorised. Fifthly, by virtue of s 5(2) of the MDA, the appellant had committed the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug since he had in his possession that drug (ie the cannabis) for the purpose of trafficking. Lastly, s 33 of the MDA, in conjunction with the Second Schedule, provides that where the quantity of cannabis being trafficked without authorisation is more than 500g, the punishment shall be death. Because the appellant and Bala were acting in concert in possessing the cannabis for the purpose of trafficking, s 34 of the Penal Code was correctly applied. For the reasons above we dismissed the appeal. On a strict interpretation of the section, there is no requirement that the Prosecution need prove when the drugs were put in the room or relevant premises. However, we would stress that, where the Prosecution has the evidence to prove the timing of the installation of the drugs, it should, as a matter of sound practice, adduce that evidence at trial. Section 18(1)(c) is the first presumption, followed by s 18(2), and thus must be invoked with circumspection and care. We were of the opinion that on the facts of this case, the Prosecution had proven its case sufficiently. In this regard, the evidence of Indra was crucial. Had there been no independent witness, no direct evidence of the key on the appellant’s person and no evidence as to when, no matter how rough an estimate, the drugs were put in the room, the Prosecution might not have discharged its s 18(1)(c) burden. The s 18(1)(c) gate in the MDA must be appropriately guarded. We were convinced that s 18(1)(c) was applied correctly in this case. What s 18(1)(c) does is to impose a presumption on a keyholder. Thus, the circumstantial evidence led “inevitably and inexorably to one conclusion and one conclusion only”: that for the purposes of s 18(1)(c), which was the first of the seven steps to conviction, the appellant was in possession and control of the keys to the flat and the said room. There was no other permutation of the evidence to persuade us that the appellant was not in possession and control of the relevant keys. For these reasons, we were convinced that Tay J had correctly found that the presumption under s 18(1)(c) applied. The appellant argued that it was in fact Bala who rented the room from Indra. The objective behind such an argument was to distance the appellant from the room and therefore from the drugs found therein. This argument lacked merit. It was clear that it was the appellant who negotiated the agreement for the rented room. Indra, a witness who had no reason to lie, testified that the appellant played the leading role in securing the room for rent. The following evidence from the verbatim notes illustrated this point. Here, Indra was recounting the conversation she had with Bala and the appellant about the rented room in her flat:\n",

      " Accordingly, for the reasons given above, we dismissed the appeal. Having considered all the arguments presented and the grounds appearing in Teo’s petition of appeal, we were satisfied that the Prosecution had indeed discharged its ultimate burden of proving its case against Teo beyond reasonable doubt. Although there was an error as to the correct application of the presumptions under ss 18 and 17 of the MDA in the decision by the trial judge, there was, as stated by the trial judge, overwhelming evidence to conclude that Teo was in possession of the drugs seized for the purposes of trafficking in them. Having reviewed the evidence in its totality, we too were satisfied that there was ample evidence to find Teo guilty of the charge against him, without resorting to any of the presumptions under ss 18 and 17 of the MDA. The finding by the trial judge that Teo was fully aware of the penalty he was facing was based on evidence before him and we saw no reason to disturb this. In any event, it was clear from the records that the charge and the notice of warning in due form, as prescribed under s 122 (6) of the CPC, were served on the accused. The charge ended with the words, “you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the [MDA] and punishable under Section 33 of the [MDA]”. The records also showed that the accused had confirmed by appending his signature to the charge that the nature and consequence of the charge was explained to him in Hokkien by an interpreter. In the circumstances, the contention that the punishment of death penalty was not brought to the attention of the accused was without merit.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed. These arguments overlap substantially with the grounds of appeal already considered above. As such, they will not be traversed again, save only to restate that the Privy Council in Reyes v The Queen did not pronounce mandatory death sentences absolutely unconstitutional, and to make the further point that their Lordships did allow that there might be circumstances in which the mandatory death sentence could be “sufficiently discriminating to obviate any inhumanity in its operation”. We agree with the trial judge’s reasoning on the effect of a conflict between a customary international law rule and a domestic statute. The trial judge held that even if there was a customary international law rule prohibiting execution by hanging, the domestic statute providing for such punishment, viz, the MDA, would prevail in the event of inconsistency. The trial judge cited Chung Chi Cheung v The King [1939] AC 160 and Collco Dealings Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1962] AC 1 in support of this proposition. The appellant’s submissions are therefore rejected. However, we are of the view that the mandatory death sentence prescribed under the MDA is sufficiently discriminating to obviate any inhumanity in its operation. It is therefore constitutional.\n",

      " The statutory presumption under s 17 being a presumption in respect of trafficking with the possibility that the death penalty might be imposed, must be read strictly. It is a provision to facilitate the application of s 5(2), whereas s 18 concerned presumptions in respect of the possession of controlled drugs, which (possession) is another principal (though not capital) offence under the Act. The Legislature would have made it clear had it wanted s 5(2) to be further reinforced by means of s 18(2). In the absence of such an express intention, we think it best to keep the presumptions under s 18 separate from that in s 17, as has always been the case. A person who is to be condemned to death under this Act must at least be proven to know that he had controlled drugs in his possession. For the reasons above, the appeals were dismissed. The court stopped there, but for reasons set out above, we now extend and hold that it could not have been the Legislature’s intention to have a crossover application of the presumptions under ss 17 and 18(2). Section 18(2) was a logical and direct complement to s 18(1); it is not an auxiliary provision to s 17. The phrase “proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession” in s 18(2) has a perfectly logical sense in the structure of the Act and in its proper place within s 18. That section provides the statutory presumptions of possession and knowledge of the nature of the controlled drugs found in any container where the drugs were not obvious to view. It clearly needed to apply to situations where the drugs were found in the possession of a person and were not obvious to view, in which event, it would be open to the trial judge to find as a fact that those drugs have been proven to be in the physical possession of that person. Hence, the phrase “proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession” in s 18(2) shifts the burden of proof to that person to show that he did not know the nature of the drugs and it may, therefore, not be sufficient for him to say merely, that he did not know that the drugs found in his room were in fact drugs. He will have to persuade the judge that he truly did not know. If he fails to rebut the s 18 presumptions he would be liable to a conviction for possession, unless an act of trafficking, as defined in s 2, is proved against him, in which event, he would be liable to a conviction for trafficking. If, a person is proved to know (as opposed to presumed to know) the nature of the drugs in his possession, then the presumption under s 17 applies and he would be liable to a conviction for trafficking even though he did not commit any act constituting the act of trafficking defined in s 2. The accused in Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP failed to persuade the trial judge that he was carrying counterfeit money in the white plastic bag and was convicted. The conviction was upheld by this court which also held that the application of s 17 was inappropriate where the presumptions under s 18 and an act constituting trafficking under s 2 had been proved, as was the case there. The presumption in s 17 applies only in situations where a person is, in the words of this court in Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP [1995] 3 SLR(R) 689, “proved” to be in possession of controlled drugs, but apart from mere possession, had not done any of the acts constituting trafficking as set out in s 2. It is contrary to the principles of statutory interpretation, and even more so, the interpretation of a criminal statute, especially one in which the death penalty is involved, to combine presumptions from two sections in an Act each serving a different function – in this case, shifting the burden of proof in one with regard to possession and the other, in regard to trafficking. Possession and trafficking are distinct offences under the Act, although possession may lead to the more serious charge of trafficking, while, trafficking itself might conceivably be committed without actual possession. The danger of mixing the s 17 and s 18 presumptions was anticipated by this court in some of its previous decisions which were not brought to the attention of the trial judge below because this was not an issue before him. The decision of this court in Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP expressed the view that for the s 17 presumption to apply, it must first be proved that the accused knew that he was in possession of the drugs.

      " For the reasons above, we dismissed both appeals. The appeals before us were entirely against findings of fact. The law presumes that a person caught in possession of prohibited drugs knows that he is in possession of such drugs, with the burden of rebutting that presumption on the person charged – what Lord Pearce would describe as “an improvement of a difficult position”: see Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 2 AC 256 at 307. Rebutting the statutory presumption is a matter of fact, and is no different from any other fact-finding exercise save that the law requires that a person rebutting a statutory presumption does so on a balance of probabilities. It is not sufficient for him merely to raise a reasonable doubt. In the present instance, the first appellant testified that he thought that he was carrying chocolates, later correcting his evidence to African herbs (that tasted like chocolate). This brought his case within the kind discussed in Shan Kai Weng v PP [2004] 1 SLR(R) 57, Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311, and the statement from Ubaka Chris Chinenye v PP cited in all the cases above as well as by the trial judge in the present case: “[I]gnorance is a defence only when there is no reason for suspicion and no right and opportunity of examination ...”. It was sufficiently clear to us, from the trial judge’s grounds of decision, that the court did not believe the explanation of the first appellant, and was thus not persuaded that he had rebutted the statutory presumption. It was a finding that the court was entitled to make on the totality of the evidence before it. The trial judge did not need to refer to thinly speculative evidence so long as it appeared clear that he had taken all the relevant and material evidence into account in making his finding. However, the word “abetment” in its ordinary sense and usage includes instigation, conspiracy, and aiding. Thus, we are of the view that the penal provision in the Act must be given the same meaning as that in the Penal Code. It would be more precise if the word “conspiracy” in the charge against the second appellant was replaced by “abetment” in conformity with the word used in s 12 of the Act. In the event, it made no material difference to the defence. The trial judge had not only found sufficient evidence connecting the second appellant to Smith and the first appellant, he had also found that the second appellant was connected with the name “Marshal”. He disbelieved the second appellant’s evidence that the initials “M.N.” written on the telephone book in his possession stood for “Malachy Nelson”, his name; or that the “Marshal” written on his laundry receipt referred to one “Joseph Marshal”. The court was satisfied “beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an arrangement between Smith and the two [appellants] for the second [appellant] to come to Singapore to collect the capsules from the first [appellant]” (at [61]). Accordingly, the second appellant was also convicted as charged. We were satisfied that on the evidence as found by the trial judge, including his rejection of the second appellant’s explanations, the court was entitled to find that there was no reasonable doubt that the second appellant was engaged in a conspiracy with the first appellant and Smith as charged. The next issue was whether an act of importing the drugs within the meaning of s 7 of the Act had been proved. There is no special definition of the words in s 7 which are clear and obvious: “Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person to import into or export from Singapore a controlled drug.” The evidence that was not disputed, and in our view, adequately proved, was that the first appellant had entered Singapore at the Changi International Airport with the sling bag and had not left the transit area of the airport from the time he arrived until he was arrested. There was no dispute that bringing the bag (and thus the drugs) into Singapore was an act of importing the drugs within the meaning of s 7. The first appellant proceeded with his defence on the basis that he came into Singapore with the bag containing the drugs. The trial judge thus had no difficulty finding that the act of importing the drugs was proved beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly, found the first appellant guilty as charged and convicted him.\n",

      " Looked at from another perspective, the present proceedings also deal with the appellant’s legal responsibility for his actions under the relevant provisions of the Act. As has been noted by the Judge, it is tragic that the appellant’s dire financial straits drove him – in part, probably in large part – to do what he did. However, each individual must take legal responsibility for his or her own actions. Unpleasant and painful though it is, this court has no choice but to decide on the issue of the appellant’s legal liability according to the law as applied to the relevant facts of the case itself. We had no choice but to find, on the evidence, that the appellant knew or was at least wilfully blind to the fact that he was transporting heroin. He had therefore not succeeded in rebutting the presumption (under s 18(2) of the Act) that he knew the nature of the drug concerned. Indeed, there was no need to invoke this presumption in the first instance. The respondent has, in the circumstances, proven its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. We find that, on the objective evidence before us, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant not only knew that he was carrying controlled drugs but also that he had actual knowledge that those controlled drugs he was carrying consisted of heroin. We should add that the appellant’s argument to the effect that he had been paid a pittance was neither here nor there. Indeed, his acceptance of the sum offered to him merely underscored the fact (which the appellant himself admitted) that he (the appellant) was in dire and desperate financial straits. Such an action is also consistent with the appellant’s professed ignorance of the respective values of the various controlled drugs. These points were, in fact, also noted by the Judge (GD at [59]); in addition, the Judge also noted (correctly, in our view) the fact “[t]hat the first – and only – mention of a fee surfaced while Uncle was strapping the drugs unto [the appellant] signifies that there was no genuine attempt whatsoever to negotiate a fee for transporting the drugs” (see GD at [60]). The following further general observations by the Judge are also, in our view, apposite (see ibid): While the appellant did claim that he had wanted to “end the matter fast” as the taxi driver had been grumbling that he had been dragged into the entire matter by the appellant, this still did not explain why the appellant did not also seek to exculpate himself after he knew he was being charged for an offence relating to heroin and which carried the death penalty. Indeed, in his evidence at trial, he said that if he had known that it was heroin, he would definitely have run away. The appellant did also claim that he was very tired but, again, given the gravity of the situation, no reasonable explanation was given by him as to why he had said nothing to exculpate himself. All this is, at the very least, consistent with the appellant having actual knowledge that the drugs he was carrying consisted of heroin. Furthermore, even on our finding that the appellant did not have actual knowledge that the drugs he was carrying consisted of heroin (based, it should be emphasised, solely on the appellant’s statements to Constable Phua and SI Ong), this is not the end of the matter, simply because there could be wilful blindness instead (which is the legal equivalent of actual knowledge (see at [123] above)). It is clear, on the evidence, that the appellant clearly suspected that the drugs he was carrying were heroin. It was for this reason that the appellant did not pursue the matter further with Uncle, lest he (Uncle) confirm beyond peradventure that the drugs (which were said to be “number 3”) were in fact heroin. It will be recalled that the appellant stated that Uncle had merely held up three fingers in response to his question as to what the packets he (the appellant) was being strapped with contained (see at [7] above). It will also be recalled that when the appellant then told Uncle that it was “a lot”, Uncle disagreed and used his fingers to indicate seven. Even at this juncture, it will be noticed that there is a discrepancy in the appellant’s own evidence as to what transpired between him and Uncle. It is clear that the appellant was attributing the quantitative element to the numbers which Uncle had indicated (here “three” and “seven”, respectively) (see also GD at [52]). However, it is equally clear that given the discrepancy in Uncle’s response within that brief moment, it was not reasonable to attribute the quantitative element to both his answers, as the appellant claimed. It is a reasonable inference, in our view, that the second response (“seven”) was quantitative in nature, whereas the first (“three”) was qualitative in nature inasmuch as it referred to the specific type as well as grade of the drug itself (here, “heroin number three”). Be that as it may, even if we assume an ambiguity, that ambiguity cried out for clarification. Yet, the appellant, according to his own testimony, did not follow-up with Uncle in this regard. Indeed, given (according to the appellant’s own evidence) Uncle’s extreme reluctance to elucidate the matter (which even bordered on caginess), a person in the appellant’s shoes would have had his or her suspicions aroused as it was clear that something was certainly amiss. This was a clear situation where following-up was not only desirable, but absolutely imperative, especially given the possible – and ultimate – sanction of the death penalty. Indeed, if satisfactory answers were not forthcoming from Uncle, a person in the appellant’s shoes still had the choice to abandon the deal they had altogether. However, it is unnecessary for us to even go so far. It is clear, as we have already noted, that the appellant did not follow-up with Uncle at all. Hence, even according the appellant’s evidence the broadest latitude, it is clear that, at the very least, the appellant was guilty of wilful blindness: He had deliberately refrained from making further inquiries and, hence turned a blind eye to what he believed to be the truth in order to avoid obtaining certain knowledge of that truth (that the drugs were such as would attract the death penalty).\n",

      " In the circumstances, we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the Judge’s decision. In our judgment, there was absolutely no plausible basis to suggest that the chain of custody of the appellant’s drugs had been compromised. We noted that the appellant never challenged the weight of those drugs when they were weighed in his presence. It also bears emphasis that the appellant’s actual possession of the yellow plastic bag and its contents was not disputed in court. Further, the appellant never suggested that the items appearing in the photographs of these exhibits were not his. Accordingly, we held that counsel had failed to establish a reasonable doubt that there could have been a mix-up of the appellant’s drugs with Lim Hock Kim’s drugs. The Judge noted (at [4] of the GD) that, crucially, the appellant had not challenged the admissibility of the statements made on 6 November 2006 and 11 November 2006. In those statements, the appellant had admitted unreservedly to his knowledge and ownership of the drugs in the yellow plastic bag. The Judge further observed (ibid) that “[the appellant] ... also admitted that he was paid to transport the heroin”. Accordingly, the Judge found that the Prosecution had made out its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant was therefore convicted. In his closing submission, Mr Ho contended that the Prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Mr Ho argued that the appellant’s drugs could have been mixed up with the drugs seized from Lim Hock Kim (“Lim Hock Kim’s drugs”). The Judge, however, was satisfied that the evidence showed conclusively that the two sets of drugs had been distinctly marked and accounted for (see the GD at [6]).\n",

      " In the light of the foregoing, we dismissed the appeal as there was nothing which suggested that the appellant’s conviction was unsafe. In the present case, no challenge was mounted against P67–P88 at the trial (see [5] and [24]–[25] above). In our view, having regard to the 12 August 2010 affidavit, we did not think that ordering a retrial so as to allow the Defence to cross-examine PW5 on the matters set out in that affidavit was likely to rebut the matters presumptively proved by P67–P88. There was one other material consideration in the present case which made a successful rebuttal highly improbable, namely: the appellant had confessed that he had indeed trafficked in 64.34g of diamorphine as charged. That quantity of diamorphine exceeded by more than four times the statutory threshold set for the imposition of the death sentence vis-à-vis the offence of trafficking in diamorphine, namely, trafficking in any quantity of diamorphine of more than 15g (see the Second Schedule to the MDA; cf Ang Soon Huat, where the difference between the statutory threshold and the amount of diamorphine trafficked as alleged by the Prosecution (which amount was eventually held by the court not to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt) was only in the region of 3.61g to 3.77g). In our view, the argument by Mr Masih would have been relevant, in the context of the Prosecution having to discharge the burden of proving an accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt, if the MDA had required the Prosecution to prove the matters contained in a s 16 MDA certificate. However, this is not the law as a s 16 MDA certificate, when admitted in evidence, is presumptive proof of the matters which it sets out unless the accused is able to prove the contrary of those matters. To quote the words of s 16 of the MDA, a s 16 MDA certificate signed by an authorised person “shall be admitted in evidence” in any proceedings for an offence under the MDA, and “on its production by the [P]rosecution without proof of signature and, until the contrary is proved, shall be proof of all matters contained therein” [emphasis added]. The effect of s 16 is that where a s 16 MDA certificate is admitted in evidence, the onus falls on the accused to prove that the matters contained in that certificate (eg, the type and the quantity of controlled drug in question) are, for whatever reasons, inaccurate and/or should not be relied upon. Given that a s 16 MDA certificate is presumptive proof (as opposed to conclusive proof) of all the matters stated therein, an accused who takes issue with the accuracy and/or the validity of a s 16 MDA certificate must cross-examine the authorised person who signed it if he (ie, the accused) wishes to take issue with the procedure or the circumstances surrounding the preparing, signing and issuance of the certificate. It bears emphasis that the appellant had the opportunity, at the trial, to rebut the matters presumptively proved by P67–P88 by cross-examining PW5 on the matters set out in those certificates and also by ascertaining from her how the scientific analysis of the White Substance had been conducted. PW5, if she had been questioned, would have been able to give evidence on how the aforesaid scientific analysis was conducted, the standard applied, the person(s) involved, the kind of equipment used and all the other matters that defence counsel would have needed to know in order to assess whether the scientific analysis of the White Substance had been properly conducted. As this was not done, the trial judge was fully entitled to assume, pursuant to s 16 of the MDA, that defence counsel was satisfied that P67–P88 did indeed prove the matters set out therein.\n",

      " For the above reasons, we agreed with the Judge’s decision, and dismissed this appeal. If, however, the fact or circumstance that is withheld will exculpate the accused from an offence, a court may justifiably infer that it is an afterthought and untrue, unless the court is persuaded that there are good reasons for the omission to mention that exculpatory fact or circumstance. This accords with common sense – if an accused believes he is not guilty of an offence that he might be charged with, he would be expected to disclose why he has such a belief. For a self-confessed trafficker like the Appellant, consumption would be an exculpatory fact. Furthermore, an exculpatory fact or circumstance has more credibility if disclosed to an investigating officer at the earliest opportunity after arrest. Thus, in Chou Kooi Pang v PP [1998] 3 SLR(R) 205, this court (without referring to Lim Lye Huat Benny ([10] supra)) held, in regard to one of the appellants, that his “failure to mention a material part of his defence at an earlier stage meant that it was less likely to be believed” (at [30]). It is necessary to add that the court is not always entitled to draw an adverse inference for failure to disclose a material fact in long statements. The reason is that s 121 of the CPC allows an accused to withhold mentioning any fact or circumstance that, if disclosed, may incriminate him. Section 121 provides as follows: These reasons alone would be sufficient to explain our dismissal of the appeal. However, for completeness, we will touch on the question of whether the Judge was correct to draw an adverse inference against the Appellant for failing to state the defence of consumption in his long statements.\n",

      " For the reasons given above, we dismissed the appellant’s appeal as we were satisfied with the Judge’s finding that the appellant had actual knowledge that the sports bag contained cannabis and cannabis mixture. In our view, the inference of actual knowledge raised by the strong circumstantial evidence in this case – including, in particular, the appellant’s failure to ask Sundar what was in the sports bag and to see what was in the sports bag when he had many opportunities to do so – was consistent with the appellant’s reply that the sports bag contained “grass” (at [38] above). We agreed with the Judge’s finding (see [40] above) that the appellant had the opportunity to see what was in the sports bag. The evidence showed beyond any reasonable doubt that he had many opportunities to see what was in the sports bag, if he had wanted to. The first occasion was at the SAS Temple when Sundar brought the sports bag to the appellant’s car. Sundar asked the appellant whether he should put the sports bag in the boot, whereupon the appellant told him to leave it on the back seat (see para 39 of the appellant’s 20 July 2006 statement (reproduced at [14] of the GD)). The appellant could have inspected the sports bag before Sundar put it on the back seat or before driving off. Another occasion arose when, according to him, Sundar suddenly wanted to get out of his car, which caused him to be suspicious of Sundar’s conduct. Instead of looking inside the sports bag at this point, the appellant drove off to his destination by taking a circuitous (and potentially risky) route. At any time during his car journey thereafter, the appellant could have stopped the car to see what was in the sports bag (since on his own account there was no car chase by the CNB officers). His stated reason that he dared not stop because he thought he was being tailed by gangsters or thugs obviously was not credible to the Judge, or to us. The Judge, in evaluating the truth or otherwise of this piece of evidence, also took into account the statement of Sundar made on 20 July 2006, which implicated the appellant. Counsel for the appellant contended that that was a self-serving statement made by Sundar to the CNB officers with a view to exonerating himself from the offence of trafficking. In his testimony given after he had been charged and convicted of a lesser offence, Sundar tried to explain away this statement by saying that what the appellant had said was “kanjapayya” and not “ganja” in order to tease Sundar. This explanation was also rejected by the Judge – in our view, rightly. The Prosecution’s response to the appellant’s arguments may be summarised as follows:\n",
      "(a)     As the Judge’s decision was based on findings of fact, it was trite that an appellate court would not disturb such findings unless they were plainly wrong or clearly arrived at against the weight of the evidence, or unless there was a misdirection as to the law (citing Public Prosecutor v Victor Rajoo [1995] 3 SLR(R) 189, Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 and Tan Kiam Peng).\n",
      "(b)     The appellant had physical control, and, therefore, physical possession of the sports bag when Sundar alighted from the appellant’s car: the appellant was transporting the sports bag back to his workplace to wait for Sundar or Abang to collect it.\n",
      "(c)     The appellant had actual knowledge of what was in the sports bag as he had admitted in his statement made at the trailer park shortly after his arrest that the sports bag contained “grass”. His explanation that he had no knowledge of the contents of that bag (and that he had said “grass” when asked about the sports bag’s contents merely because he had earlier heard the CNB officers say that the bag contained “grass”) was rejected by the Judge: if the appellant had not known what was in the sports bag, he should have maintained his earlier answer to the CNB officers that he was unsure what was in the sports bag (see [15] above). Further, when asked what was in the sports bag, the appellant had not replied that it contained “books” or “safety shoes” or “industrial things”, although those were the kinds of things that he was expected to transport for Kumar on 13 July 2006.\n",
      "(d)     The Prosecution had put to the appellant the proposition that he knew for a fact that the sports bag contained cannabis, which was why he replied “grass” when asked what the bag contained (which proposition the appellant denied).\n",
      "(e)     The appellant led the CNB officers on a prolonged car chase with a view to avoiding arrest. His explanation that he had thought he was being followed by “gangsters or thugs” in broad daylight on busy public roads was an affront to common sense as he could have called the police on his handphone for assistance if that had indeed been the case.\n",
      "(f)     Sundar implicated the appellant as to the latter’s knowledge of what was in the sports bag four days after his arrest. In contrast, he resiled from that statement implicating the appellant (by recalling that the appellant had said “kanjapayya” and not “ganja”) more than a year after his arrest, and only after he had been charged with and convicted of a non-capital drug offence in connection with his role in the material events. Accordingly, the Judge was entitled to rely on Sundar’s first statement, rather than on his testimony in court, to find that the appellant had informed Sundar that the sports bag contained ganja.\n",
      "(g)     The Judge was correct in finding that the appellant was wilfully blind about the sports bag containing cannabis on the basis of the appellant’s own statements in para 41 of his 20 July 2006 statement, where he said that he had “no intention to see the content inside”, that he “did not want to check the [sports] bag as [he] thought it was better not for [him] to see” and that “[he] suspected that something was not right, and the [sports] bag might contain something illegal”. What was admitted in this passage constituted wilful blindness as laid down by this court in Tan Kiam Peng.\n",
      "(h)     Furthermore, the factual matrix showed that the appellant had such a level of suspicion about what was in the sports bag that he should have inquired about or inspected its contents. The appellant’s previous interactions with Kumar and Anand, the surreptitious manner of the receipt and delivery of the items alleged to be “industrial boots” or “books” on the first and second occasions, the appellant’s acting on a call from an unidentified person to go to the Hawkerway Food Court, the appellant’s failure to clarify with Abang what he meant by “books” and the appellant’s agreeing to hand over $4,000 to someone who would deliver a bag to him, taken together, all showed that despite the presence of suspicious circumstances which should have prompted the appellant to look into the sports bag to find out what was in it, he did not do so.\n",

      " In conclusion, we would reiterate that our examination of the High Court GD shows that the Judge did not apply the ss 17(c) and 18(2) presumptions in convicting the Appellant of the Charge. In any event, on the evidence, we found that the Prosecution had proved the Charge against the Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt without having to rely on either of the aforesaid presumptions. We therefore dismissed this appeal. The Judge did not draw any adverse inference against the Appellant for remaining silent at the trial. In our view, there was hardly any need for the Judge to do so. The Prosecution’s evidence against the Appellant effectively stood unchallenged and it amply proved the Charge against him beyond any reasonable doubt. In our view, there was a further reason why the Judge was right to dismiss the aforesaid argument of the Defence. As this court noted in Nguyen Tuong Van v Public Prosecutor [2005] 1 SLR(R) 103 (“Nguyen Tuong Van”), there may be discrepancies between the weight of drugs recorded by a CNB investigation officer and that recorded by a HSA officer due to the difference in “the purpose of the weighing by each officer and the different levels of their expertise” (at [38]). For a CNB investigation officer, scientifically acceptable accuracy is not required. Instead, “what is crucially important is to ensure that there [is] no mixing of the drug exhibits or ... tampering of the contents” (see likewise Nguyen Tuong Van at [38]). Significantly, in the present case, the Appellant did not make any allegation that the 136 Packets had been tampered with, and also did not challenge the CNB officers’ testimonies regarding the chain of custody of those packets. At [12] of the High Court GD, the Judge addressed one of the sharper exchanges that took place during the Defence’s cross-examination of the Prosecution’s witnesses. This related to the cross-examination of I/O Aaron Tang in relation to his conditioned statement dated 20 June 2010 which contained his sworn evidence of his conduct of the investigation.[note: 28] In our view, the Judge rightly dismissed the Defence’s suggestion that “it was crucial that [I/O] Aaron Tang did not include in his own conditioned statement the weights of the [drug] exhibits that he recorded in his investigation diary” (see [12] of the High Court GD). The Judge accepted that I/O Aaron Tang’s explanation for this omission (namely, that the weights of the drug exhibits recorded in his investigation diary were not as accurate as the weights recorded in HSA’s reports) was reasonable. The Judge also pointed out that in any event, I/O Aaron Tang had rectified the omission by providing (during cross-examination) the weights of the drug exhibits recorded in his investigation diary. In addition, the Judge noted (likewise at [12] of the High Court GD) that “[c]ounsel did not highlight any particular aspect of [I/O] Aaron Tang’s evidence that ought to be given less weight as a result of his omission”.\n",

      " In so far as rebutting the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge is concerned, we have stated earlier that the accused only needs to prove that he had no knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug. Consistent with the burden which he has to discharge, the accused has to adduce sufficient evidence to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know the nature of that drug. This is a question of fact in each case, and turns very much on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility of the defence witnesses (especially that of the accused, if he chooses to testify). In Tan Kiam Peng at [141], this court held that s 18(2) of the MDA included both actual knowledge in its “purest form” (also referred to as “actual knowledge simpliciter” in PP v Lim Boon Hiong [2010] 4 SLR 696) as well as wilful blindness. However, one must be careful to avoid unnecessary refinement of the mens rea of knowledge. Wilful blindness (or “Nelsonian blindness”) is merely “lawyer-speak” for actual knowledge that is inferred from the circumstances of the case. It is an indirect way to prove actual knowledge; ie, actual knowledge is proved because the inference of knowledge is irresistible and is the only rational inference available on the facts (see Pereira v Director of Public Prosecutions (1988) 63 ALJR 1 at 3). It is a subjective concept, in that the extent of knowledge in question is the knowledge of the accused and not that which might be postulated of a hypothetical person in the position of the accused (although this last-mentioned point may not be an irrelevant consideration) (ibid). Wilful blindness is not negligence or an inadvertent failure to make inquiries. It refers to the blindness of a person to facts which, in the relevant context, he deliberately refuses to inquire into. Such failure to inquire may sustain an inference of knowledge of the actual or likely existence of the relevant drug. It must also be emphasised that where the Prosecution seeks to rely on actual knowledge in the form of wilful blindness, the alleged wilful blindness must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In our view, while there may be a conceptual distinction between the broad view (that the knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA refers to knowledge that the drug is a controlled drug) and the narrow view (that the knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA refers to knowledge that the drug is a specific controlled drug, eg, heroin or “ice”), the distinction has no practical significance for the purposes of rebutting the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug. To rebut the presumption of knowledge, all the accused has to do is to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know the nature of the controlled drug referred to in the charge. The material issue in s 18(2) of the MDA is not the existence of the accused’s knowledge of the controlled drug, but the non-existence of such knowledge on his part. The Judge found on the evidence that the appellant had actual knowledge of the contents of a packet wrapped in newspaper in his possession (“the Bundle”), and that, in the alternative, the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug under s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The Judge further found that the appellant could not rely on the defence of duress in s 94 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). Accordingly, he convicted the appellant of the offence charged and sentenced him to death as mandated by s 33 of the MDA read together with the Second Schedule to the MDA.\n",

      " In conclusion, we had no doubt that both Pang and Cheong knew that they were smuggling drugs. Their challenge in this appeal related to a finding of fact by the Judge, ie, that each of them had failed to rebut the presumption laid down in s 18(2). For the reasons discussed above, we were of the opinion that the Judge was eminently correct to hold that the s 18(2) presumption had not been rebutted. The appeals of Pang and Cheong were therefore dismissed. The Judge found both Pang and Cheong guilty of the respective charges which each of them faced and made the following findings of fact:\n",
      "(a)     In relation to Pang’s testimony that she was helping Teng Mor deliver precious stones, that she made a cursory check of A1 but could not find the articles and that she did not report this to Teng Mor, the Judge found that her story was unconvincingly narrated and not credible. The Judge also pointed out that she had two opportunities, including during the recording of her cautioned statement, to tell her story to CNB officers and yet she said that she did not know what the luggage bag contained. (See Judgment at [4].)\n",
      "(b)     In relation to Cheong’s evidence that he was helping Lau De bring gold bars to Singapore and that he did not report to the latter when he checked the bag and could not find the gold, the Judge found this testimony unconvincing and that it did not create any reasonable doubt as to whether he had been trafficking in heroin. (See Judgment at [5].)\n",
      "(c)     It was immaterial that the CNB did not make adequate efforts to trace Lau De or check his cell-phones. The absence of any trace of Lau De or Teng Mor was not taken as evidence in favour of or against either accused. (See Judgment at [5].)\n",
      "(d)     The only issue was whether there was any evidence that would create any reasonable doubt as to whether Pang and/or Cheong knew that A1 contained heroin. According to Pang and Cheong, both claimed to be carrying valuable goods for their principals. However, when they could not find the goods, neither raised an alarm with their principals. Either they lied about checking the suitcase, or they did not check because they knew what they were carrying, namely heroin. The Judge found that the evidence against Pang and Cheong was incontrovertible and that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. (See Judgment at [6].) The first appellant, Mdm Pang Siew Fum (“Pang”), a 56-year-old Malaysian, and the second appellant, Mr Cheong Chun Yin (“Cheong”), a 27-year-old Malaysian, were both convicted of trafficking in not less than 2,726g of diamorphine (“heroin”), and sentenced to death by Choo Han Teck J (“the Judge”) in Public Prosecutor v Pang Siew Fum and another [2010] SGHC 40 (“the Judgment”). Both of them appealed against their convictions and sentences. We heard and dismissed the appeals on 21 October 2010. We now give our reasons.\n",

      " These proceedings, it bears emphasis, relate to a capital charge on which the Appellant was found guilty. The judicial duty to give full reasons is therefore even more compelling in such a matter. It is, of course, never a light matter to order a retrial. Much anxiety, inconvenience and even hardship is caused all round and sometimes the ultimate decision may not be different. However, given the lack of clarity in the Judgment and our inability as an appellate court to assess the credibility of the Appellant, we have no alternative but to direct that there shall be a retrial instead before another High Court Judge, who will have the opportunity to closely scrutinise afresh the Appellant’s credibility in the context of all the relevant evidence. We would also emphasise that nothing in this Judgment should be taken as affecting any substantive determination in the subsequent trial and appeal, if any. Finally, we are also constrained to observe that we received little assistance from the Appellant’s counsel in the present proceedings. Their submissions fell well short of the standard that we ordinarily expect from counsel in matters of this nature. A brief judgment is not necessarily an inadequate one. There is always merit in conciseness and no virtue in prolixity. However, a judgment that does not explain the foundations for findings of facts and/or the basis for the determination of the witness’s credibility on pivotal issues is prima facie inadequate to justify a judicial outcome and could be seen as flawed. For the reasons given above, we are unable to affirm or overrule the Judge’s decision as we do not clearly understand how he arrived at certain primary findings of fact that led to his rejection of the Appellant’s defence. We also do not think it is proper in this matter for this court to scrutinise the evidence on record in a de novo manner in order to construct a case for the Prosecution or the Defence, much less to make definitive findings of fact without the benefit of observing the presentation of evidence and witnesses’ testimony firsthand. First, we are unable to ascertain what the Judge held was the precise mens rea of the Appellant. We cannot discern from the Judgment whether the Appellant was held to have actual knowledge of or was wilfully blind to the nature of the drugs he possessed; or whether he was convicted because the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA was not rebutted. Although any one of these possibilities is sufficient to satisfy the mens rea element of the offence, it is important that the Appellant knows what his precise mens rea was held to be, in order to exercise his right of appeal effectively, as the corresponding primary facts necessary to satisfy this mens rea can then be scrutinised by the appellate court. Regretfully, we do not think that the judicial duty to state reasons has been satisfied in the present case. In our view, the nature of the case here, which involved a capital charge, necessitated detailed reasons, especially in relation to the findings of fact made and application of the law to such findings of fact. It would enable the Appellant, members of the profession and the public to understand the reasons for the decision. In addition, detailed reasons were necessary to enable this court to understand the grounds for the Judge’s decision and to appraise its correctness. There were no other countervailing policy grounds that would militate against the duty to provide detailed reasons here. With this in mind, we turn to consider the areas in which the reasons provided were insufficient.\n",

      " For the reasons stated above, we dismiss this appeal where Chan’s conviction is concerned. As regards Sng’s conviction for the offence of abetment by instigation of the trafficking of not less than 17.70g of diamorphine, we amend this charge to that of abetment by aiding of the trafficking of the same quantity of diamorphine and convict him of the amended charge. In the result, this appeal is dismissed in respect of both Chan and Sng. We are unable to agree with this submission. In our view, the words “that offence” in s 12 of the MDA refer to the offence which the Prosecution is able to prove against an accused on the admissible evidence. In the present case, the offence that could have been proved against Choong Peng is that of trafficking in 30 packets of substance containing not less than 17.70g of diamorphine, and, accordingly, he too could have been charged with a capital offence. However, the commission of an offence by an offender does not necessarily result in his being charged for that particular offence. As fully explained by this court in Ramalingam Ravinthran v AG, the Attorney-General, as the Public Prosecutor, may exercise his prosecutorial discretion to charge two or more offenders engaged in the same criminal enterprise with different offences punishable with different punishments according to (inter alia) their culpability in the carrying out of that criminal enterprise. He is not required by law to charge all offenders involved in a criminal enterprise with the same offence, be it a capital offence or a non-capital offence, provided that his decision is neither biased nor made as a result of taking into consideration irrelevant matters (see Ramalingam Ravinthran v AG at [51]–[53]). The expression “that offence” appears twice in s 12 of the MDA. From a textual reading of the section, “that offence” refers to “any offence under this Act”. On this premise, Mr Wong contended that the words “that offence” in s 12 (and by extension, the words “any offence under this Act” as well) referred to the offence which Choong Peng committed. This, on Mr Wong’s reading of s 12 of the MDA, meant that the quantity of diamorphine in respect of which Sng was charged as an abettor in the present case must be the same as the quantity of diamorphine which Choong Peng was convicted of trafficking in CC 1/2009 (ie, “not less than 14.99 grams of diamorphine”[note: 46] [emphasis in original omitted]). Another ground based on which Mr Wong sought to challenge Sng’s conviction was that the Prosecution violated Art 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”) in charging Sng with a capital offence and Choong Peng with a non-capital offence when the charges arose from the same events that led to both men (among others) being arrested on 23 January 2008.[note: 45] This argument was recently rejected by this court in Ramalingam Ravinthran v AG, and we do not propose to repeat what this court stated at [70]–[72] of that judgment. As Mr Wong was unable to substantiate his case that the Attorney-General, in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor, had exercised his prosecutorial discretion based on irrelevant considerations, we dismiss this argument.\n",

      " For the above reasons, the Appellant succeeds in his appeal and we hereby set aside his conviction. Given that the Trial Judge found that there was insufficient basis for him to apply the statutory presumptions of possession and knowledge against Bala, the Appellant should not be in any worse position than Bala – absent the evidence in P97 and P132 – merely because the Appellant, Tamil and Bala were arrested only after the cannabis had been moved from SCQ 143 X to SGT 809 X. We might have been more prepared to apply the relevant statutory presumptions against the Appellant had the cannabis been placed directly in SGT 809 X from the outset, but that was not the case here. Further, just as Bala had possession of the cannabis for only a “short period of time” (see the Judgment at [145]), the position was the same vis-à-vis the Appellant as he (along with Tamil and Bala) was arrested shortly after the cannabis was moved to SGT 809 X. It can thus equally be said of the Appellant that, just as in Bala’s case, “[t]he events from the retrieval of the bundles in [the] bag [ie, the blue paper bag recovered from the boot of SGT 809 X (see [7] above)] to the arrest took place too quickly for him to make enquiries or to examine the bundles” (see the Judgment at [146]). In the circumstances, we see no reason why the law should find against the Appellant when Tamil and Bala were acquitted by the Trial Judge. Whatever its reasons might be, the Prosecution has not appealed against Tamil’s and Bala’s acquittals. We are thus placed in the difficult position of having to treat those acquittals as correct in law, and to assess the Appellant’s culpability on precisely the same evidential scales as those employed by the Trial Judge to acquit Tamil and Bala. After careful consideration, we cannot say that the evidence on record reveals that the Appellant is any more culpable than Tamil and Bala (who were both acquitted), especially given that traces of cannabis were found in Bala’s urine whereas no trace was found in the Appellant’s urine. We also note that unlike the Appellant, Tamil has an antecedent. Having said that, we are, as just mentioned, constrained by the Prosecution’s stance (in not pursuing appeals in respect of the Trial Judge’s decision to acquit Tamil and Bala) to deem Tamil’s and Bala’s acquittals correct in law, and, accordingly, we shall make no further comment in that regard. We would only mention that the evidence suggests that as between the Appellant, Tamil and Bala, one or more (or possibly all) of them knew that the blue paper bag recovered from the boot of SGT 809 X contained cannabis or, at the very least, some form of controlled drug. However, the evidence against the Appellant specifically is flawed, and we find it unsafe, based on such evidence, to convict him of the capital charge brought against him. In this regard, we would also draw attention to the reason given by the Trial Judge for acquitting Bala. At [145]–[148] of the Judgment, it was stated: If the three men had been arrested before the cannabis was moved to SGT 809 X, the presumption of possession under s 21 of the MDA (2001 Ed) could have been invoked only against Tamil (as the cannabis would then have been found in SCQ 143 X, which Tamil had borrowed from Sundrammurthy), but not against the Appellant. Given these circumstances, we do not think it justifiable to apply that presumption against the Appellant merely because it so happened that the CNB surveillance officers arrested him (along with Tamil and Bala) only after the cannabis had been moved to SGT 809 X. It follows that since the Appellant has neither been proved nor presumed to have had the cannabis in his possession at the material time, the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA (2001 Ed) cannot be invoked against him. In our view (and with respect), the Trial Judge failed to adequately consider the above facts in assessing whether, in the first place, the statutory presumptions of possession and knowledge could be applied in the present case. He merely proceeded on the basis that these presumptions were applicable and summarily concluded that they had not been rebutted by the Appellant (see [11] above). No factual examination was done (apart from making the bald statement that “the cannabis was recovered from SGT 809 X and ... [the Appellant] was in possession and control of the car” (see [121] of the Judgment)) and no reasons were given. In these circumstances, we are unable to endorse the conviction of the Appellant for the capital offence charged against him.\n",

      "relevant paragraphs:\n",
      " For the reasons stated above, Quek’s appeal is dismissed. Accordingly, we hold that there is nothing irregular in Quek being convicted on the amended charge. Since this court is not confronted with the slightly different scenario whereby Winai lacked the requisite knowledge of the full quantity of the seized drugs forming the basis of the criminal conspiracy alleged, whether the answer to the question of congruity in that scenario might be different is a question on which there is no necessity for us to offer a concluded view. There is however authority for the proposition that it is not necessary that all the conspirators must know each and every detail of the conspiracy as long as they are co-participators in the main object of the conspiracy – see Yash Pal Mittal v State of Punjab (1977) 4 SCC 540 at [9] and Nomura Taiji v PP [1998] 1 SLR(R) 259 at [110]. The question which must follow and remains unanswered is (a) whether knowledge of the precise quantity of the controlled drugs specified in the charges preferred against co-conspirators can be characterised as a mere detail as outlined by the case law cited above or (b) whether it should more rightly be viewed as an integral element of the underlying agreement as part of the main object of the criminal conspiracy. While on the first proposition, (a), the quantity per se is not a factor which each co-conspirator need be alive to, on the second proposition, (b), the Public Prosecutor’s ability to establish the individual’s actual knowledge of the specific quantity of the controlled drugs in the preferred charge will directly impact the fundamental enquiry before the court as to whether criminal conspiracy has been made out. Thus the point is that where sufficient evidence can be adduced to prove the underlying agreement between the co-conspirators beyond a reasonable doubt, the outcome per se of the proceedings of a co‐conspirator, or the death or disappearance of the co-conspirator is not ipso facto a reason to set aside the conviction or amend the charge preferred against the other co-conspirator. In the present case, the Public Prosecutor’s decision to prefer charges against Quek and Winai involving different quantities of the seized drugs does not undermine the fact that there was a conspiracy between them to traffic in the total seized quantity. The situation that results is in fact not dissimilar from the situation where a co-conspirator has either been acquitted or has disappeared. It bears emphasising that the evidence adduced establishing the underlying agreement between the respective co-conspirators remains undisturbed. Indeed, in contrast to a situation involving the acquittal of a co-conspirator, both Quek and Winai were in fact convicted in the present case; the difference in punishments arising solely from the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, a discretion accorded to the Public Prosecutor under the Constitution. Furthermore, we also think that Winai’s separate charge for possession of not less than 14.99g of diamorphine in furtherance of a criminal conspiracy with Somchit and Quek to traffic in the stated quantity of the seized drugs, is not, on a plain reading, incongruous with the amended charge on which Quek was convicted as “not less than 14.99 g” could include 62.14g. We would reiterate that in Winai’s SOF upon which he was convicted on the reduced quantity, the full weight of the seized drugs discovered was clearly stated.\n",

      " For all the reasons above, we allow both the present appeals. For the above reasons, we do not consider it safe to let Roshamima’s conviction on the amended charge, which is a capital charge of importing diamorphine (see [2] above), stand. Accordingly, we set aside her conviction of the amended charge, substitute the amended charge with the following charge and convict her of that charge instead: This principle is well-illustrated by Mohamed Kunjo v PP [1977–1978] SLR(R) 211 (“Mohamed Kunjo”), a Privy Council decision on an appeal from Singapore. In that case, the appellant did not raise the defence of sudden fight to a charge of murder either at his trial or on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The question was whether the defence could be raised before the Privy Council for the first time. Consistent with the line of authorities which we referred to earlier, the Privy Council reasoned that in a jury trial, the trial judge must put to the jury all matters which might reasonably entitle the jury to return a lesser verdict (see Mohamed Kunjo at [19]). If the trial judge failed to do that, the Privy Council would intervene. The Prosecution in Mohamed Kunjo did not suggest that this principle was inapplicable where there was a bench trial or where the burden was on the accused to establish his defence (which was the position in Mohamed Kunjo by reason of the Evidence Act (Cap 5, 1970 Rev Ed)). The Privy Council also referred to an Indian decision involving a bench trial in which the Supreme Court of India substituted a verdict of culpable homicide for one of murder because it found that the special exception of sudden fight was made out notwithstanding that this special exception was not raised during the trial (see Chamru Budhwa v State of Madhya Pradesh AIR 1954 SC 652). On the facts of Mohamed Kunjo, the Privy Council considered that the evidence was such that the trial judges could not have reasonably concluded that the defence of sudden fight was made out. This was because the accused had taken undue advantage of the victim (see Mohamed Kunjo at [21]). Accordingly, the Privy Council held that the trial judges did not err in failing to refer to that defence in their judgment. The same principle should apply in a bench trial, with the trial judge acting as the jury. The task of ensuring that offenders are “neither over-convicted nor under-convicted, nor acquitted when they have committed a lesser offence of the type charged” falls squarely on the trial judge. The trial judge cannot shirk the responsibility of considering any alternative defence reasonably available on the evidence before the court even if the Defence has not relied on that defence, or even if the Prosecution and the Defence have agreed not to raise it. In a criminal trial, the court’s duty and function should not be constrained by any agreement between the Prosecution and the Defence not to raise a particular defence before the court.\n",

      " For the reasons given above, we therefore dismissed the application. With respect to ground (c), counsel argued that the Public Prosecutor had acted in bad faith in “targeting” the applicant for capital punishment. In substance, his argument was that the evidence showed that the applicant did not know (or at least there was a reasonable doubt that he knew) that he was carrying a controlled drug or that he did not know the nature of the controlled drug, and therefore the Public Prosecutor in bringing the capital charge against the applicant had acted in bad faith. This argument was a non-starter as the Public Prosecutor is the sole decider as to the merits of a prosecution. In any event, the fact that the Judge found the applicant guilty on the evidence confirmed the propriety as well as the validity of the Public Prosecutor’s prosecutorial decision. Furthermore, counsel’s submission was, in effect, that the applicant was wrongly convicted on the evidence, and that this court was wrong to have affirmed the conviction. There was no basis for us to reopen our previous decision. In our view – and this is our second comment – the purpose of s 53 of the MDA was not to enable the Public Prosecutor to bring a trafficking charge for a capital offence in the District Court so as to effectively reduce it to a non-capital charge. That would explain why there has been no such prosecutions in the Subordinate Courts. Indeed, if the Public Prosecutor were to do so, it would raise an issue as to whether the Public Prosecutor’s decision might have been arbitrary or might not have been made in good faith. In our view, the purpose of s 53 of the MDA was to vest in the Subordinate Courts sentencing powers with respect to non-capital drug offences beyond their normal sentencing powers under the CPC 2010 (previously the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)). We rejected counsel’s argument that the reasoning in Mohammed Muktar Ali had any bearing on s 53 of the MDA as neither counsel’s reasoning nor rationale in trying to impugn the constitutionality of the provision made any sense to us. A discretion in the prosecuting authority to prosecute for a more serious offence rather than for a less serious one is not open to any constitutional objection (see Lord Diplock in Teh Cheng Poh alias Char Meh v Public Prosecutor, Malaysia [1980] AC 458 at 474–475) unless it is in breach of Art 12 of the Constitution (which has not been alleged in this case). Even if s 53 of the MDA were declared unconstitutional, it would only have meant that the District Court could not impose punishments beyond its ordinary sentencing jurisdiction under s 303(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of 2010) (“the CPC 2010”) (which is up to ten years’ imprisonment). Since the applicant was not charged in the District Court, the argument had no relevance to his conviction in the High Court.\n",

      " Under s 397(5) of the CPC, this court, in hearing and determining any questions referred, may make such orders as the High Court might have made as this court considers just for the disposal of the case. Accordingly, we set aside the orders at [66] of the Judgment (where the High Court set aside the Respondent’s conviction and remitted the case to the District Court for a new trial) and dismiss the Respondent’s appeal against his sentence, given that his sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane is the mandatory minimum sentence for his offence of importing a Class A drug. For the above reasons, we hold that the Question should be answered in the negative, viz, s 7 of the MDA does not require the Prosecution to prove that the accused imported the controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking in order to secure a conviction under that section. In the alternative, Mr Vergis submitted that even if the intent to traffic cannot be read as an element of the offence of drug importation, we should at least hold that it is a good defence to a s 7 charge for the accused to prove that the drugs were imported for a purpose other than trafficking. Here, it is apposite to refer to s 107 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed): We do not think that the court should rewrite the law just because the sentence imposed on the Respondent on account of the regime of minimum sentence may appear harsh on the present facts (as the quantum of the drugs imported was so minute). How the word “import” in s 7 should be interpreted should not depend on the weight of the drugs that happen to be involved in a given case. It would be seen from the statement of DPM Teo above that Parliament had carefully calibrated the sentences it prescribed for the various offences, including the regime of minimum sentences. Parliament having deliberately adopted the definition of “import” set out in the IA would have appreciated that the minimum sentence would be applied even where the importation was in relation to a minute quantity of drugs. There is nothing in the parliamentary debates which suggests that Parliament had regarded the act of importing drugs into Singapore for personal consumption as being less pernicious than trafficking in Singapore. What is clear from all the statements made by the ministers in Parliament over the years is that we have toughened our stand in our fight against the scourge of drugs. We would reiterate (see [11] above) that if it was Parliament’s intention for trafficking to be a necessary element of the offence of importation under s 7, it could easily have so provided (see also the views of US court in Robert Probert quoted in [60] above).\n",

      " For the reasons set out above, we dismissed both CCA 3 and CM 68. At this juncture, we think it apposite to address Mr Masih’s written submissions on the Prosecution’s objections which he did not (correctly, in our view) pursue at the hearing before this court. In particular, he sought to rely on the decisions of this court in Ramalingam Ravinthran v AG [2012] 2 SLR 49 and Yong Vui Kong v PP [2010] 2 SLR 192 in support of the criminal motion. We were of the view that these two decisions could be clearly distinguished from our present case. Both decisions concerned the legal issue as to whether the Court of Appeal had exhausted its jurisdiction, viz, the conviction and sentence of an accused person; this logically required the Court of Appeal to have been seised of jurisdiction in the first place. This was clearly not the situation here, since whether or not this court was seised of jurisdiction in the first place was the very question to be determined. It was clear to us, however, that there could be no true appeal against Ridzuan’s sentence until and unless the Public Prosecutor’s decision not to issue the certificate of substantive assistance was set aside and a certificate issued. Absent the issuing of such a certificate, the conjunctive requirement in s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA would not be satisfied and the alternative sentencing option of life imprisonment in s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA could not be considered by the Judge. The constitutionality of the mandatory nature of the death penalty itself was emphatically confirmed by this court in Nguyen Tuong Van v PP [2005] 1 SLR(R) 103. Before delving further into the question of the Court of Appeal’s jurisdiction and powers, we think it apposite to first consider the nature of CM 68. As was observed above (at [85]), its genesis was most unusual since it was averred to have been the means by which the fourth ground of appeal against Ridzuan’s conviction and sentence was to be argued.\n",

      " Furthermore, it is at the discretion of the trial judge whether or not to have a Newton hearing. Any suggestion that an accused person will be allowed to adduce new evidence at the sentencing stage, because he believed he had a valid reason to deliberately withhold such evidence and even though this is subject to conditions, should be avoided. The purpose of the recent amendments to the MDA is to state formally that if he provides substantive assistance to the authorities (if he is a courier) and if he obtains the relevant certificate stating the fact of such assistance, the court may decide not to impose capital punishment. The accused person does not have to avail himself of this opportunity. The purpose of the amendments is therefore to give him an incentive to come clean. There is no suggestion in the parliamentary debates that the amendments will result in changing the trial process and give the accused person a chance to deliberately stifle evidence to gain an advantage and then to speak the truth when that strategy fails. If he were allowed to do so, it may even be said that the court is condoning such a strategy which it should be discouraging instead. Furthermore, if the trial process is changed for capital offences under the MDA, then one may argue that it should also be changed for the offence of murder for the same reason, ie, not to put the accused person in an invidious position where the evidence withheld would be inconsistent with his primary defence. However, we express reservation on his view that, subject to some conditions, an accused person may give evidence about his being a courier at the sentencing stage even though he deliberately withheld such evidence at trial on the ground that such evidence would be inconsistent with his primary defence. As this issue was not, strictly speaking, part of the three questions, we state our brief reasons below. Incidentally, the Prosecution, who should be concerned with any re-opening of findings of fact leading to the conviction or the casting of any doubts on such findings, does not share the Judge’s concerns. Referring to Chum’s case, Mr Abdullah argued that it was “unclear why the Judge apprehended that calling new evidence may undermine the facts already found at the trial”. This reinforces my view above that the Prosecution countenances the possibility and arguably desirability in some exceptional situations of the calling of new evidence at the sentencing stage. Mr Abdullah further observed that as the precise role of Chum was not in issue at the trial, any evidence which Chum might seek to introduce at the sentencing hearing would be limited to his role, and as such, would not have any impact on the court’s finding in relation to Chum’s knowledge of the drugs that eventually supported the conviction.\n",

      " Put simply, the concern is that accused persons may attempt to “manufacture defences”, particularly through carefully rehearsed statements (both written and/or oral) which are intended to rebut the presumptions under the Act, thus enabling the accused person concerned to escape capital punishment as mandated under the relevant provisions of the Act. That is why this court was at pains to emphasise “the finely balanced set of facts” in Khor Soon Lee which were also described as being “rather unusual” (see Khor Soon Lee at [29], reproduced in the preceding paragraph). Indeed, in Khor Soon Lee, there was (as alluded to above at [33]) a consistent pattern of conduct centring on the dealing in drugs which did not involve the death penalty. In addition, this consistent pattern of conduct was admitted by the Prosecution. It should be further noted that the court in that case assumed that the testimony of a significant witness (who was not available) would have been in the accused person’s favour. The danger of abuse is clear: accused persons might henceforth (as alluded to at the outset of this paragraph) rehearse contrived statements intended to pull the proverbial wool over the eyes of the judge in the trial court by claiming that they thought that they were dealing in a drug which did not involve the death penalty. Indeed, in the present case, there was yet another variation on this particular theme inasmuch as the Respondent claimed that there was a consistent pattern of dealing in a drug which did potentially involve the death penalty, but which weight carried during each dealing or transaction was carefully calibrated so as not to be of a weight which attracted the death penalty upon conviction. We must admit that we had some difficulty with this particular argument, at least when it was viewed at first blush. Notwithstanding the fact that we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the Judge’s decision that the presumption under s 18(2) of the Act had been rebutted on the evidence before him, we think that it is timely to render some general observations on certain specific issues – some of which arose during the course of oral submissions before this court. For the reasons set out above, we were of the view that the Judge’s findings were not plainly against the weight of the evidence. His findings were reasoned and supported by the evidence, and, thus, the threshold for appellate intervention had not been crossed. We therefore dismissed the appeal. In the trial below, the burden was on the Respondent to “prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known” (see Dinesh Pillai at [21]) that the weight of Ice was above 250g. In the Judge’s view, which we agreed with, he had successfully discharged this burden of proof. In this regard, we found the decision of this court in Khor Soon Lee v PP [2011] 3 SLR 201 (“Khor Soon Lee”) helpful. To briefly summarise, in Khor Soon Lee, the accused was a drug courier who had had agreed to transport Erimin, Ketamine, Ice and Ecstasy into Singapore. However, on the day of his arrest, he was found to be in possession of diamorphine instead (a charge which attracted the death penalty). He was convicted for trafficking in diamorphine, and appealed to this court, arguing that he did not know that the drugs in his possession were diamorphine. The appeal was allowed, and two facts were significant in this particular regard. First, this court noted (at [23]) that the accused had sought assurances from his supplier that he would not be trafficking in diamorphine as he was afraid of the death penalty. Second, it was also significant that, on numerous previous occasions, he had only trafficked in Erimin, Ketamine, Ice, Ecstasy, but not diamorphine. Having this in mind, the court was therefore satisfied that the accused was “at most, either negligent or reckless in not checking the package, but not wilfully blind” (at [28]). Given our observations above, we likewise found that the Respondent could not be said to be wilfully blind simply because he did not check the weight of the Ice in the packets. To this end, we would also affirm the Judge’s findings that the sight of two plastic bags would not be significant enough to cause the Respondent to suspect that the weight of Ice in his possession was more than 250g (notwithstanding the Judge’s error in using the net weight of the Ice instead of the gross weight, as he should have done (see above at [18(b)(ii)])).\n",

      " For the reasons above, we dismiss the Appellant’s appeal against conviction. As the appeal against sentence is purely consequential and no specific arguments have been raised by the Appellant as to the propriety of the sentence imposed, and as we also do not see that the sentence imposed is in any way improper, we would affirm the sentence and dismiss the appeal against sentence. It bears repeating that the burden was on the Appellant to prove that he did not have the mens rea. It was in his effort to discharge this burden that he attempted to construct an explanation of how the drugs could have made their way into his motorcycle seat. One of the explanations he relied on was the Kumar Theory, a key plank of which was “Gobi”. The Appellant’s failure to identify Gobi, along with the surrounding problematic issues (his questionable desire to shield Gobi from implication, the apparently inconsistent reasons at attempting to explain why Gobi was not mentioned in the earlier statements, and his unquestioning compliance to Gobi’s request that he save his contact under a moniker) mean this key plank is of dubious origin. The onus is on the Appellant to establish his explanation (in this case, the Kumar Theory). Given these jarring gaps, he has failed to do so. This was what the Judge concluded (the GD ([15] supra) at [42]), and rightly so. It was not simply the Appellant’s failure to identify Gobi that was critical. Rather, his failure simply added on to the plethora of gaps in the Kumar Theory as to make it implausible. Although we agree with the Judge that the voluntariness of these statements are beyond reproach, we have our doubts as to whether these portions can truly be construed as his confessions within the meaning of s 17 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), that is, “[admissions] ... stating or suggesting the inference that he committed [the] offence”. Just because the Appellant said he wanted to plead guilty does not necessarily mean he was admitting to the commission of the offence. As pointed out by Mr Wong, it seemed that the Appellant’s intent to “plead guilty to the offence” as stated in the “confessions” was motivated more by a desire on the part of the Appellant that he wished his “ordeal to be over in the quickest possible way” and to return to his parents rather than by a desire to come clean. In particular, we observe that his reference to “in order to prove my innocence, I cannot remain in prison for 3 or 4 years”, shows that he was far from admitting his guilt. For these reasons, we find that the statements do not bear out a clear admission of his wrongdoing and as such we do not think it is safe to rely on them in reviewing the entire case. Based on the arguments raised before us, we are unable to find that the Judge erred in convicting the Appellant. We will set out the reasons for our holding below.\n",

      " In the result, and having regard to the totality of the evidence as discussed above, we are convinced and find that the Respondent has not rebutted the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA. While we are mindful of the advantages that the Judge as a trier of fact has, we are driven to the conclusion that the Judge ought to have rejected the Respondent’s defence, which is in the final analysis an unlikely account from an unreliable source. The Judge’s acquittal of the Respondent is wrong and against the weight of the evidence. Accordingly, we allow the appeal, and convict the Respondent on the charge preferred against him. Farid is an example of the sparing manner in which an appellate court will exercise its discretion to review a trial judge’s findings of fact. In that case, this court expressed its reservations about the veracity of the defence, which is that the respondent had an agreement not to deliver a quantity of methamphetamine beyond 250g as that would attract the death penalty. Nevertheless, this court was not satisfied that the trial judge’s decision to accept the respondent’s defence, that the latter thought the drugs which were delivered to him would not exceed 250g, was plainly wrong and dismissed the Prosecution’s appeal. Another aspect which the Judge considered to be inconsistent with guilty knowledge on the Respondent’s part is the fact that the Respondent got into the car with Hamidah after he had handed the Black Luggage to her. The Judge reasoned that that if the Respondent had known of the Drugs in the Black Luggage, “it would be highly unusual for him to agree to continue to be associated with it and prolong the risk of being caught” and that the “natural instinct of any person with such knowledge would be to go off immediately” (GD at [60]). We accept that this is by far the strongest point in the Respondent’s favour. However, people do not always act in ways that we expect of them. As the Prosecution points out, the same argument might also be applied to Hamidah, who was convicted. After all, Hamidah too was prolonging the risk of getting caught by inviting the Respondent into her car in search of a meal. The Respondent may have had his own reasons for going into Hamidah’s car despite his knowledge that the Black Luggage contained the Drugs. Interestingly, Hamidah even said that the Respondent appeared nervous. Yet Hamidah received the bag and offered the Respondent a lift. Therefore, there must be more than what meets the eye. An individual happenstance (ie, the Respondent going into the car of Hamidah) must be viewed against the entire objective facts. The Judge, with respect, placed too much weight on this single factor when assessing the evidence. In the present case, the Respondent’s lies were deliberate ones relating to material issues and which have been independently proven to be untrue. The essential question, as we have said earlier, is whether the Respondent had lied for innocent reasons, or whether he had intentionally lied because he knew that telling the truth would link him to the crime. The Respondent’s excuses for the lies were wholly unsatisfactory and unbelievable. It is clear to us that he had deliberately lied to distance himself from the drugs in the Black Luggage, the existence of which he knew. Quite simply, there is no acceptable explanation for the lies save for his realisation of his guilt. To suggest that the Respondent was justified to lie as a defensive move would be to turn reason and logic on its head.\n",

      " For all these reasons, we were of the opinion that the application brought by the Applicant had no merit and accordingly dismissed it. The differentia in s 33B of the MDA for discretionary sentencing or life imprisonment to apply clearly bear a rational relation to the social object of the MDA. In relation to the requirements in s 33B(3) of the MDA, the fulfilment of which entitles offenders to be sentenced to life imprisonment, there is nothing unreasonable in Parliament’s decision not to impose the ultimate punishment of the death penalty on an offender who has played a relatively restricted role in the offence and who suffers from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility. As a matter of logic, there is generally less justification for a strong deterrent sentence to be imposed on someone whose responsibility for the offence has been substantially impaired by reason of a mental condition. An analogy to this is Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code which provides that culpable homicide is not murder if the offender’s mental condition substantially impaired his moral responsibility for causing death. As for s 33B(2) of the MDA which relates to the “substantive cooperation” exception, there is an obvious relation between this differentia and the object sought to be achieved, which is to reach further into drug networks by obtaining assistance in disrupting drug trafficking activities from offenders who have performed a “key role”, viz, that of “courier”, in drug operations, and who could furnish a lead to the CNB to identify the “suppliers and kingpins outside Singapore”. In our view, the first limb of the “reasonable classification” test was undoubtedly satisfied in this case. The first limb requires that the classification prescribed by the impugned legislation be based on an intelligible differentia, which means that the differentia embodied in the legislation “must not only identify a clear distinguishing mark or character, but must also be intelligible (as opposed to illogical and/or incoherent) [emphasis in original]” (Lim Meng Suang at [67]). The differentia in s 33B of the MDA identified in the previous paragraph is clearly intelligible. The requirements that the offender must sufficiently prove that his involvement in the offence was restricted to acting as a courier and that he was suffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility, or that he must have received a certificate of co-operation from the Public Prosecutor pursuant to s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA, all bear a clear distinguishing character and certainly cannot be said to be illogical or incoherent. The requirements specified in s 33B of the MDA are the relevant differentia on which the classification that the Applicant complained of is based. Offenders who have been convicted of drug trafficking offences and sentenced to death prior to the passing of the Amendment Act qualify for discretionary sentencing under s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA or life imprisonment under s 33B(1)(b) of the MDA depending on whether two conjunctive requirements are satisfied. In the case of discretionary sentencing under s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA, the two conjunctive requirements are: (a) that the offender proves, on a balance of probabilities, that his involvement in the offence was restricted to activities such as transporting, sending, or delivering a controlled drug (commonly known as acting as a “courier”); and (b) the Public Prosecutor certifies that, in his determination, the person has substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. In the case of mandatory life imprisonment under s 33B(1)(b) of the MDA, the offender must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that: (a) he was suffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in relation to the offence; and (b) his involvement in the offence was restricted to activities such as transporting, sending, or delivering a controlled drug. It is these requirements in s 33B of the MDA which must be examined to see whether they satisfy the “reasonable classification” test under Art 12(1) of the Constitution.\n",

We also could not see any basis to admit the further evidence which the Appellant sought leave to introduce on appeal, or to stay the execution of his death sentence. We therefore dismissed his appeal, as well as his application for leave to adduce further evidence and his request for a stay of the execution of his sentence. In our judgment, it was clear that the Appellant would not be able to avail himself of s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA, not least because his involvement in drug trafficking went beyond “transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug”. There was no reason to interfere with the Judge’s finding that the Appellant was actively involved in purchasing, re-packaging and selling drugs. We therefore refused to stay the execution of the Appellant’s death sentence. The Judge’s decision on sentence formed the basis of a criminal reference brought by the Prosecution and heard by this court as it was constituted for the present appeal. We unanimously held, in a judgment reported as Public Prosecutor v Chum Tat Suan and another [2015] 1 SLR 834 (“Chum Tat Suan”), that the Judge was “wrong to have held that [the Appellant] was a courier when the Judge was ‘satisfied that [the Appellant’s] involvement in trafficking went beyond transporting, sending or delivering [the drugs]’” [emphasis in original] (see Chum Tat Suan at [70]). We thus quashed the Judge’s decision on sentence, and remitted the matter to him to determine whether the Appellant’s involvement in drug trafficking was restricted to the activities within s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA. Thereafter, the Judge found that the activities which the Appellant had engaged in fell outside the scope of that provision, and accordingly sentenced him to death. At this juncture, we should explain that the Judge convicted the Appellant of the two drug trafficking charges on 27 August 2013, and thereafter delivered his judgment on sentence (reported as Public Prosecutor v Abdul Kahar bin Othman [2013] SGHC 222 (“Abdul Kahar (Sentencing)”)) on 24 October 2013. In that judgment, the Judge drew attention to the then “newly-enacted s 33B of the [MDA]” (see Abdul Kahar (Sentencing) at [1]). He held that “[a]lthough ... the [Appellant’s] involvement ... went beyond transporting, sending, or delivering the drugs”, he would give the Appellant “the benefit of the doubt” (see Abdul Kahar (Sentencing) at [4]) since the case was “among the first cases under the new provisions” (see Abdul Kahar (Sentencing) at [5]). He thus held that the Appellant “had acted as a ‘courier’ only” (see Abdul Kahar (Sentencing) at [5]).\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, we were of the view that there was no merit in the appeals against conviction. Since Masoud was not found to be a courier, and the Public Prosecutor did not certify that he had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities either within or outside Singapore, he was liable to suffer the mandatory death sentence. Masoud’ appeal was accordingly dismissed. As for Mogan, the Judge had imposed on him the mandatory minimum sentence which could not be reduced on appeal. Therefore, his appeal against sentence was dismissed as well. In the present case, there was no reason to doubt the competency of SSSGT Faizal who has had over 13 years of experience dealing with accused persons and drug informers and would therefore be well-acquainted with drug slang. Although there were terms that he appeared to be unfamiliar with (for example, “document”), his interpretation of key terms such as “chocolate” and “air con” was consistent. He testified that the term “chocolate” referred to heroin because of its colour and the term “air con” was used to refer to “ice” which refers to methamphetamine. He also testified that the prices stated in the notebook and text messages corresponded with the drug prices around the time of the offence. Given that street slang for drugs is by its very nature informal and dynamic, we did not think that SSSGT Faizal’s inability to provide a comprehensive explanation for all the terms used in the notebook and the text messages rendered his evidence on the key terms less reliable. In addition, we were not persuaded by the submission that the incorporation of the “reasonable person test” would operate to the disadvantage of an accused. As alluded to above, it is often difficult to prove actual knowledge and the “reasonable person test” provides evidential assistance in this regard. By parity of reasoning, it is typically difficult for an accused to prove the absence of knowledge. Thus, the reasonable man’s perspective may equally work in the accused’s favour by enabling him to establish his lack of knowledge and therefore, aid in his rebuttal of the s 18(2) presumption. Indeed, it has been observed that the “reasonable person test” would afford an offender who genuinely did not know what he was carrying the chance of proving so on a balance of probabilities: see Benny Tan at p 41. We were accordingly unable to agree with counsel’s submission that the “reasonable person test” would adversely affect an accused’s prospect of rebutting the s 18(2) presumption. From the outset of its decision, this court emphasised that negligence or recklessness did not amount to wilful blindness and cautioned against making a finding of wilful blindness unless there was a strong basis for doing so (at [20]). On the facts of that case, the court held that the appellant’s failure to check the contents of the package containing the drugs in question constituted at best negligence or recklessness (and therefore, did not rise to the level of wilful blindness) given his consistent pattern of drug deliveries and his relationship with Tony. The appellant had no strong reasons to suspect that the package contained diamorphine and the fact that on that occasion, he and Tony were to travel separately was not sufficiently peculiar to raise a strong suspicion.\n",

      " The onus is on the Appellant to rebut the presumptions of possession and of knowledge of the nature of the drugs in ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA. The Appellant has attempted to do so by claiming that he thought that the Bundles were presents, without elaborating on the nature of the presents. Presents may also contain prohibited things. Such a defence is no different in effect from the not-uncommonly heard plaintive plea of “I really didn’t know they were drugs but I also didn’t know what they were”. In my opinion, such a defence has to be examined in the context of the factual situation in any particular case. On the evidence adduced in this case, I do not think the Appellant has managed to rebut the legal presumption of knowledge in any way. The Judge was therefore correct in convicting the Appellant on all three charges. There is no appeal against the sentences but I would add that I also see no reason to disagree with the Judge regarding his finding that the Appellant was a courier within the meaning of s 33B of the MDA and with his decision on sentence. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. Both Mogan and Sulaimi were serving sentences in prison here at the time of the Appellant’s trial and were available as witnesses during the trial. Mogan had by then been sentenced to 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane while Sulaimi had been sentenced to imprisonment of five years and six months and three strokes of the cane. Mogan would have been the best person to corroborate the Appellant’s assertion of his lack of knowledge of the contents of the Bundles. However, neither the Prosecution nor counsel for the Appellant decided to call Mogan or Sulaimi to testify at the trial. Upon whom then should the duty fall to call one or both of these witnesses to testify? In such a situation, the operation and effect of the legal presumptions under the MDA become highly significant. The Bundles containing the controlled drugs were found in the Appellant’s possession, thereby enabling the Prosecution to invoke the presumptions of possession and knowledge in ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA respectively. In relation to the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2), it was the Appellant who bore the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that he had no knowledge of the nature of the controlled drugs in his possession. It was not the duty of the Prosecution to call evidence to prove that the Appellant did not lack knowledge of the drugs in his possession because the s 18(2) presumption, once invoked, meant that the Appellant had knowledge of the nature of the drugs and the Prosecution was entitled to rest its case on that fact, leaving the Appellant to provide evidence to rebut the presumption (see the recent decision of this court in Obeng Comfort v PP [2017] 1 SLR 633 at [33]–[40] of that judgment). If the Appellant did so, the Prosecution would then have to decide whether or not it was necessary to call evidence to rebut the Appellant’s evidence. Since the Appellant’s defence turned on his claim that he was simply doing Mogan a favour by delivering some “presents” to Mogan’s friend, it was open to, and indeed incumbent upon, the Appellant to call Mogan as his witness and to apply to cross-examine him if necessary. However, according to the Appellant’s counsel, the Appellant made a considered decision not to call Mogan as his witness at the trial. It should be noted too that the same counsel had also acted for Mogan when Mogan was brought to court to answer his case. In my opinion, the evidence showed that the Appellant was conscious of the need to keep the Bundles away from sight. It will be recalled that the black plastic bag which contained the Bundles was initially placed by the Appellant in the basket at the front of his motorcycle. Shortly afterwards, the Bundles were poured into the centre compartment of the Haversack and pushed into a corner. The Appellant also placed the five packets of bread that he had bought at the petrol kiosk (see [90] above) into the same compartment. After that, came the packet of Indian cooked food with curry. Other than the packets of bread and the packet of cooked food, the compartment containing the Bundles also held the Appellant’s miscellaneous personal belongings such as a red Singtel pouch, a handkerchief, a mobile phone charger, a car charger, many sockets, an LCD screen cleaning kit, a plastic container with one earpiece, a piece of blue cloth and an Allen key. The circumstances therefore showed that the Appellant was trying to keep the Bundles away from sight by placing them in one corner at the bottom of the centre compartment of the Haversack. As I have indicated earlier, this also showed that he had no concern that the alleged presents in the Bundles could be damaged by all his other belongings in the same compartment. This was clearly one of the factors that pointed to his knowledge of the contents of the Bundles. I mention here in passing that by the time the Appellant arrived at Jalan Besar to meet the intended recipient of the Bundles (ie, Sulaimi), he had apparently taken the packet of cooked food out from the Haversack and placed it somewhere on his motorcycle, presumably in the basket at the front, because the CNB officers found the packet of cooked food on the motorcycle, as stated in the SOAF. As was held by this court in Yeo Choon Huat v PP [1997] 3 SLR(R) 450 at [22], ignorance is a defence only when there is no reason for suspicion and no right and opportunity of examination. Clearly, the Appellant should have had ample reasons for suspicion and he had many opportunities to find out more about the delivery that Mogan asked him to make. According to the Appellant’s evidence at the trial, he was with Mogan for about 15 minutes on the evening of 12 June 2013 before he set out for Singapore. In contrast, according to his statement recorded on 16 June 2013 at 9.40am, he was actually at Mogan’s house for about 45 minutes, having arrived there at about 7.30pm to 7.45pm and having departed therefrom for Singapore at about 8.30pm (see paras 10 and 12 of that statement). However, I would give allowance for the time that Mogan could have taken before he “came down from his place” to meet the Appellant, and I would accept that the meeting that evening lasted for about 15 minutes. In any case, these estimated times were quite inaccurate since it was accepted in the SOAF that the Appellant actually entered Singapore at 8.15pm that day (see [76] above). Even so, the Appellant had more than sufficient time to ask Mogan about the things that were in the black plastic bag handed to him, especially since they felt heavy. However, without even a hint of curiosity, all that the Appellant asked Mogan was how he was supposed to contact Mogan’s friend in Singapore. Mogan’s response in any event did not state even the friend’s name or the friend’s telephone number for the Appellant to establish contact in Singapore. In my opinion, the Appellant did not ask Mogan for more information about the Bundles because he did not need to. He did not need to because in all probability, he was aware of their contents.\n",

      " As mentioned earlier, we allowed Kalwant’s criminal motion to adduce further evidence about the panparak during the hearing. For the reasons set out above, we now dismiss Kalwant’s and Norasharee’s appeals. In the overall analysis, we find that the only conclusion is that Yazid was truthful in respect of the 23 October 2013 meeting and of what was discussed with Norasharee. We therefore agree with the Judge that the Prosecution’s case against Norasharee, similarly with its case against Kalwant, was proved beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, Kalwant and Norasharee would have a common incentive to discredit Yazid. Norasharee, in particular, would have a specific incentive to exaggerate his and Yazid’s gangland involvement. First, both Kalwant and Norasharee must have found Yazid’s statements highly adverse to them because if the claims in those statements were accepted as true, then both Kalwant’s mens rea (ie, actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs) and the entirety of Norasharee’s offence would be proved. Second, their prospect of facing the death sentence was very real. Kalwant would have been concerned about not receiving the certificate of substantive assistance because the Prosecution had made serious allegations during the trial that he had obstructed the course of justice by tipping off the suspects that the CNB had planned to arrest at the Toh Guan area. Norasharee would have similar concerns because he appeared to have given practically no information to the CNB in his statements and because his role would have been more than a mere courier as he was the one giving instructions to Yazid. After assessing the evidence, we were led to the inescapable conclusion that Yazid was truthful when he claimed to have taken instructions from Norasharee at VivoCity on 23 October 2013 regarding the drug transaction that was to take place the next day. Yazid’s evidence was clear and consistent. On the other hand, the alternatives presented in Norasharee’s defence are too fanciful to raise any reasonable doubt in Yazid’s testimony. Norasharee’s evidence failed in three critical aspects – his failure to explain why Yazid would want to frame him, how Yazid knew he was at VivoCity on 23 October 2013 and why he denied previously that he knew Yazid.\n",

      " We therefore dismiss the appeal in its entirety. While we note that the Appellant has also appealed against sentence, he has not presented substantive arguments in this regard. Given that (in the absence of a certificate of substantive assistance from the Public Prosecutor) the death penalty is mandatory for the capital charge, we are satisfied that it was correctly ordered. This renders the appeal against the sentence on the non-capital charge academic. In any event, we also find no reason to interfere with the sentence imposed for that charge. For the foregoing reasons, we could not find any basis to interfere with the Judge’s decision to convict the Appellant on both charges. The Appellant’s entire defence consisted of scurrilous accusations and wild, irrational, and unfounded theories which appeared to have been calculated to raise illusory doubts. It is of interest to note that in the Appellant’s written submissions for this appeal (which were prepared by his lawyer, Mr Amolat Singh, before he was discharged and re-appointed as a McKenzie friend as noted at [2] above), in a passage seeking to explain the Appellant’s inconsistent evidence as to who could have planted the drugs to frame him, it is stated that “[the Appellant’s] guess as to who might have planted the drugs necessarily entails a great degree of speculation on his part”.[note: 100] That really says it all. The same goes for his Number Nine Theory (see [80] above). This fictitious web of conspiracy that the Appellant had spun expanded over the course of the trial, had grown to a considerable size by the time of this appeal, and continued to grow even after the oral hearing through the Appellant’s unsolicited further submissions. This web engulfed not only the CNB officers, but also the HSA personnel, the Interpreter, the Driver, the security manager of City Square Mall,[note: 96] the Appellant’s family’s domestic worker, Meisaroh (see the GD at [32], [35], [43(d)–(e)] and [45]), and also the Appellant’s Handwriting Expert. The Judge, too, was accused of intimidating the Appellant (although the Appellant stopped short of asserting that the Judge was an actual member of the conspiracy), when all the Judge had done was ask a prisons officer present in the courtroom about what disciplinary measures could be used to deter the Appellant from persistently misbehaving himself during the trial.[note: 97] Even the Appellant’s lawyers were not spared: two of his lawyers, having represented him for part of his trial, were accused by him of assisting the Prosecution “to introduce [a] false witness”.[note: 98] By the Appellant’s own count, his case was that a total of 36 persons had lied simply to “fix him up”.[note: 99] The Appellant would have this court believe that all these men and women, whether related to CNB or not, somehow agreed to frame the Appellant in a capital case just to suppress two alleged assaults committed by CNB officers in which the Appellant allegedly suffered “mild tenderness”. Such an outrageous accusation has only to be stated to be dismissed; it does not come close to raising a reasonable doubt as to the Appellant’s guilt.\n",

      " For the reasons above, we dismiss Ragunath’s appeal against his conviction. His appeal against sentence is necessarily also dismissed as he has received the minimum possible sentence in law. Hence, considering all of the above, our judgment is that there is no reasonable doubt that the bulk of the heroin in the Bundle – at least 15g of the heroin (if not more) – was intended to be trafficked by Ali, especially after one includes the heroin that he intended to give to Selamat. Selamat has also failed to rebut the statutory presumption against him under s 17 of the MDA as the bulk of the heroin in the Bundle in his possession was intended to be transported by him to Ali for the purposes of trafficking. Accordingly, we dismiss their appeals. The important point is that it was never Ali’s or Selamat’s case below that either of them intended individually to consume half of the drugs in the Bundle. Rather, their evidence was always premised on the assertion that together they intended to consume that amount. For the reasons stated earlier, that is plainly insufficient to reduce the amount of drugs specified in the individual charges against Ali and Selamat to below the capital amount. This is even if we accept Ali’s evidence that he would consume one packet of 8.4g of heroin (gross weight) each day and Selamat’s evidence that he was given a ration of 6g of heroin per day by Ali. Even on these consumption rates, it is clear that neither Ali nor Selamat could have individually consumed half of the heroin in the Bundle within the five to six days that Ali claimed he expected to finish selling and consuming the entire quantity of heroin in the Bundle. This is precisely the reason why they sought to rely on their aggregate consumption rates. The Bundle contained 456.2g of granular/powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 27.12g of diamorphine. Therefore, in order to uphold Ali’s and Selamat’s sentences of death, we must be satisfied that at least 15g of diamorphine (ie, the amount in net weight that attracts the imposition of capital punishment: see the Second Schedule of the MDA) or approximately 252.3g of the drugs in the Bundle (in gross weight) was intended to be trafficked. Here we reiterate that the personal consumption defence in this case may be applied to deduct from Ali’s and Selamat’s respective charges only the individual amount of heroin which each of them had intended to consume, and that there is no legal basis to deduct the total amount of the drugs which they had intended together to consume from the amount in both their trafficking charges. This analysis necessarily leads us to find that:\n",

Here we reiterate that the personal consumption defence in this case may be applied to deduct from Ali’s and Selamat’s respective charges only the individual amount of heroin which each of them had intended to consume, and that there is no legal basis to deduct the total amount of the drugs which they had intended together to consume from the amount in both their trafficking charges. This analysis necessarily leads us to find that:\n",

      " For the reasons above, we dismiss Ragunath’s appeal against his conviction. His appeal against sentence is necessarily also dismissed as he has received the minimum possible sentence in law. Hence, considering all of the above, our judgment is that there is no reasonable doubt that the bulk of the heroin in the Bundle – at least 15g of the heroin (if not more) – was intended to be trafficked by Ali, especially after one includes the heroin that he intended to give to Selamat. Selamat has also failed to rebut the statutory presumption against him under s 17 of the MDA as the bulk of the heroin in the Bundle in his possession was intended to be transported by him to Ali for the purposes of trafficking. Accordingly, we dismiss their appeals. The important point is that it was never Ali’s or Selamat’s case below that either of them intended individually to consume half of the drugs in the Bundle. Rather, their evidence was always premised on the assertion that together they intended to consume that amount. For the reasons stated earlier, that is plainly insufficient to reduce the amount of drugs specified in the individual charges against Ali and Selamat to below the capital amount. This is even if we accept Ali’s evidence that he would consume one packet of 8.4g of heroin (gross weight) each day and Selamat’s evidence that he was given a ration of 6g of heroin per day by Ali. Even on these consumption rates, it is clear that neither Ali nor Selamat could have individually consumed half of the heroin in the Bundle within the five to six days that Ali claimed he expected to finish selling and consuming the entire quantity of heroin in the Bundle. This is precisely the reason why they sought to rely on their aggregate consumption rates. The Bundle contained 456.2g of granular/powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 27.12g of diamorphine. Therefore, in order to uphold Ali’s and Selamat’s sentences of death, we must be satisfied that at least 15g of diamorphine (ie, the amount in net weight that attracts the imposition of capital punishment: see the Second Schedule of the MDA) or approximately 252.3g of the drugs in the Bundle (in gross weight) was intended to be trafficked.

      " For the foregoing reasons, we allowed the appeal to the extent that we ordered the matter to be retried before another High Court judge. The Prosecution has accepted, and we have determined, that the first facet of its case – that the Appellant gave Tan the Jorano bag of drugs – is affected by reasonable doubt. Accordingly, at the retrial, the Prosecution will be confined to mounting its case against the Appellant on the basis that he sent Tan the Delivery Messages, this being what we have defined (at [7] above) as the Alternative Case. In closing, we lay down guidance for the Prosecution. In cases such as the present where the Prosecution advances a composite case comprising several facets and it would not be reasonably clear to the accused, absent an express statement to this effect, that the Prosecution is seeking a conviction based on any individual facet of its case, it may be prudent for the Prosecution to make this explicit. We highlight two points in particular:\n",
      "(a)     First, the charge should, if practicable, clearly state the various facets of the Prosecution’s case against the accused. In the present case, it seems to us that the acts of participation alleged against the Appellant – namely, his handing of the Jorano bag of drugs to Tan and his sending of the Delivery Messages to the latter – could and perhaps should have been included as particulars of the charges which the Prosecution proceeded with.\n",
      "(b)     Second, the Prosecution should make clear that it is seeking a conviction of the accused based on any one of the multiple facets of its case. If this cannot be done in the charge, it could be made clear in the opening address at the trial. There may also be other ways by which the Prosecution can clearly communicate to the accused that it is relying on the various components of its case as alternative stand-alone bases for securing a conviction; we do not mean to limit the ways in which the Prosecution may do so, save to note that whichever method is adopted should be in writing. Thus, where a Case for the Prosecution is served for the purposes of the criminal case disclosure regime prior to a trial in the State Courts, the Prosecution might clearly state therein that it is seeking a conviction of the accused based on any one of the alternative elements of its case. Nevertheless, we did not think that the proper order in the circumstances was to acquit the Appellant. Ultimately, the allegation that the Appellant had sent Tan the Delivery Messages was part of the composite case that the Prosecution had advanced in the proceedings below. Our concern was that this element had not been clearly articulated as a stand-alone basis for convicting the Appellant, with the result that the Appellant might have been prejudiced in his defence. Furthermore, we did not determine that as a matter of evidence, the Prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant had sent Tan the Delivery Messages. Rather, we never embarked on considering that facet of the Prosecution’s case for the reasons given above. In Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP [1996] 1 SLR(R) 95 at [29], L P Thean JA, in delivering the judgment of this court, observed that an appellate court’s power to amend a charge against an accused person with a view to convicting him on the amended charge thereafter “has to be exercised with great caution and not to the prejudice of the accused”. The same view was expressed in PP v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd [1996] 1 SLR(R) 112, a judgment released on the same day, in which Yong Pung How CJ set out the relevant principles as follows (at [21]):\n",

The primary cases run by the Prosecution in the court below and in the appeal are evidently different, which could, potentially, be prejudicial to an accused given a different set of facts. Ultimately, it made no difference to the outcome in this case; we agreed with the Judge that all three elements of the offence in relation to Zainal were proved on the evidence before us and that the presumptions under ss 17 and 18 could also apply on either basis of running the case, namely, by proving the facts of knowledge and possession and invoking the presumption of trafficking, or by invoking the presumption of possession and/or knowledge and proving that such possession was for the purpose of trafficking; and, having analysed each of the scenarios in which the relevant presumptions were properly invoked, we were satisfied they were not rebutted. Hence we were satisfied there was no question at all of prejudice in this case. However, for the reasons we have set out above, it would, in our judgment, be important in future cases for the Prosecution to state clearly which presumption(s) it relies on as its primary case where the presumptions in both ss 17 and 18 could potentially apply. To illustrate the potential significance of this point, we refer to the case that was advanced by the Prosecution in this case in relation to Zainal. In the court below, the Prosecution’s primary case, as can be gleaned from its written closing submissions for the trial, was that the presumptions of possession and knowledge under ss 18(1) and 18(2) respectively applied (and were not rebutted) and that the fact of trafficking was proved. It was also on this primary basis that the Judge analysed the facts (see the GD ([1] supra) at [15]), although the Judge ultimately found that all three elements of the offence were both proved and presumed. On appeal, however, the Prosecution’s primary case appeared to have changed; it was now the Prosecution’s primary case that the presumption of trafficking under s 17 applied (and was not rebutted) and the facts of possession of the drugs and knowledge of their nature were proved.

We would like to record our appreciation of the efforts made on the appellant’s behalf by his counsel, Mr Aaron Lee, who did his best in the face of a very difficult case. For these reasons, we do not accept the arguments that the appellant made to impugn the findings made by the Judge. Indeed, we agree with the reasoning and findings of the Judge. In any event, taking the appellant’s case at its very highest, on his own account, he saw the pink paper bag in the van when he entered it after leaving the flat and knew then that the bag contained heroin. On that basis, the elements of possession and knowledge were satisfied. In those premises, the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA would have been triggered, and we are satisfied that the appellant has not rebutted that presumption. The appellant was convicted by the trial judge (“the Judge”) on one charge of possession of not less than 49.98g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking under ss 5(1)(a) read with 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”).

      " For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Appellant’s submission that he should be considered a “courier” because his involvement in the offence falls within the scope of s 33B(2)(a)(i)–(iv) of the MDA, is without merit. We accordingly dismiss his appeal and affirm the High Court’s decision to pass the sentence of death on the Appellant. The Appellant’s third argument is that his act of division and packing was “necessary for his onward transmission of the correct quantity of drugs” to the intended recipients. We have set out full reasons at [92]–[104] above to explain why this is a mischaracterisation and understatement of the nature of the Appellant’s conduct. In our judgment, what the Appellant really sought to accomplish, in the absence of any satisfactory explanation by the Appellant, after receiving “Boy Ahmad’s” instructions to divide one of the “batu” into two and pack each of the resulting half-“batu” into separate packets is the division and packing of drugs for the purpose of distribution. This is entirely consistent with his statement about the role he was to play for the purposes of trafficking diamorphine. It should be recalled that prior to the Appellant’s commencement of his drug trafficking activities, as stated at [8] above, he met “Boy Ahmad” to discuss the nature of his involvement in the trafficking of diamorphine. “Boy Ahmad” told the Appellant that he would send someone to deliver the drugs to his flat. He was then to await “Boy Ahmad’s” instructions to repack the delivered drugs into smaller parcels and deliver the repacked parcels to customers who would come to the second floor of his flat’s lift lobby to collect the divided and repacked drugs. Consistent with the Appellant’s role, “Boy Ahmad” passed him a digital weighing scale to ensure accuracy in the division of the drugs. On the face of his statement, it would appear that his role in the drug trafficking enterprise – indeed his central role – was to divide and repack the diamorphine on “Boy Ahmad’s” instruction for distribution to “Boy Ahmad’s” customers. Shanti would head to the Appellant’s block to pass him the undivided “batu”. “Boy Ahmad’s” customers would then travel to the Appellant’s block or near it to collect the divided and repacked drugs from the Appellant (see [10] above). Indeed, one would not be unreasonable in characterising the Appellant’s residence as a sort of “distribution hub”. In the circumstances, it behoves the Appellant to explain that the reason and purpose for the intended division and repacking was unrelated to that of distribution. There can be little doubt – and, significantly, the Appellant himself does not dispute – that the Appellant would have gone on to deliver those packets of half-“batu” to recipients, just as he had done before on 12 May 2014 (see [10] above), if CNB officers had not then entered the flat. Division and packing for such a purpose cannot be regarded either as facilitative of or incidental to the transporting, sending or delivering of drugs. The Appellant’s involvement in the offence of possession of diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking therefore does not fall within the scope of s 33B(1)(a)(iii). We also reject the Appellant’s assertion that his division was “not meant to facilitate distribution or sale” as the divided portions were still “many times above the retail size”. For the reasons that we have set out at [107] above, this is an irrelevant consideration. In any event, given the Appellant’s choice to remain silent and the lack of any supporting evidence from the defence, it remains nothing but an unsubstantiated assertion (see [115] above). We now turn to the Appellant’s substantive submissions. We accept the Appellant’s argument that his act of handing $8,200 to Shanti on 16 May 2014 (the day of his arrest) was necessary to allow him to receive the diamorphine from her and therefore that act in itself did not take him out of the definition of a courier. We have explained our view at [86] above that an offender’s receipt of money in exchange for the drugs that he delivers to the recipient does not, in itself, take an offender out of the definition of a courier. It is an incidental act to his delivery of the drugs because of the inherently transactional nature of the activity. Employing the same line of reasoning, the passing or paying of money to an individual who hands the offender the drugs that he is to transport, send or deliver can be considered to be incidental to those latter acts. As mentioned at [14] above, the Appellant chose to remain silent at the close of the Prosecution’s case and did not offer oral evidence in his defence. Consequently, he did not allow himself the opportunity to substantiate certain factual claims made in his submissions, such as that his division of the “batu” was “not meant to facilitate distribution or sale as the divided [“batu”] was many times above the retail size”.[note: 26] The Appellant’s defence was simply that the Prosecution had not proven that all of the loose diamorphine that was retrieved from the rubbish collection point had been in his possession (see [14] above). In these circumstances, we consider that it would be wholly inappropriate to attach any weight or credit to factual assertions made in the Appellant’s submissions for which no oral (or any other type of) evidence was adduced in support. Even more crucially – and as we have explained – the burden rests with the Appellant to prove on a balance of probabilities that his role was “restricted” to that of “transporting, sending or delivering” or preparatory or incidental acts thereto. If, in order to discharge that burden, the Appellant intended to satisfy the court that the reason or purpose for his intended division and packing of the diamorphine was to facilitate the transporting, sending or delivering (rather than for distribution) of those drugs, then it was incumbent on him to put before the court evidence – including his oral evidence – that he had such a purpose in mind, just as the offenders in Yogaras and Muhammad Farid had done. We fail to see how that burden can be discharged by electing to remain silent in the face of clear evidence, found in the statements provided by the Appellant himself, that the Appellant was to await instructions from “Boy Ahmad” on how the drugs that he had divided and repacked into smaller packets were subsequently to be distributed, just as he had done so on a previous occasion (see [12] above). In the light of those statements, the need for the Appellant to adduce evidence either to rebut or account for what was recorded therein was a matter of particular urgency. For this reason, we are also of the view that it is no answer to say that the facts are largely not in dispute and therefore nothing should turn on the Appellant’s election to remain silent. The onus lies on the Appellant to prove to the court’s satisfaction that – quite contrary to what is indicated in the Appellant’s statements – he had a reason or purpose for his dividing and repacking that fell within the scope of s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA. In our judgment, it would therefore not merely be speculative to suggest that nothing meaningful would have emerged from his cross-examination if he had elected to testify; such an assertion would also overlook the fact that Parliament has deliberately chosen to cast the burden on the Appellant to prove his qualification as a courier notwithstanding his intention to divide and repack the drugs. It is correct that it is the Appellant’s prerogative to remain silent but equally he must accept the consequences that his election may result in him failing to discharge his burden of proof. In that regard, it must be borne in mind that the burden to establish that an offender is a courier rests with that offender, and in deciding whether that burden has been discharged, there is no reason why the court ought only to have regard to the evidence adduced by the Prosecution.\n",

      " For these reasons, I dismiss both appeals against conviction and affirm the decision of the Judge in convicting both appellants on their respective capital charges. There was no doubt that the huge amount of diamorphine was meant for trafficking. Neither appellant satisfies any of the requirements set out in s 33B of the MDA. The Judge therefore did not have the discretion to consider whether imprisonment for life and caning should be imposed instead of the death penalty. Accordingly, I also affirm the Judge’s decision to impose the mandatory death sentence on both appellants. In my judgment, there was absolutely no reason for Fadzli to volunteer the statement that “I was not known as Abut to anyone”. He did not think there was any need to explain his alias “Afad” during the recording of P119. The handwritten sentence was written by him neatly in English and the sentence was unequivocal. He was educated up to NTC3 and was obviously conversant in English, his chosen language for the recording of P119. He did not appear to have been rushed during the recording because he made four other additions of details in P119 after he added the sentence in the first paragraph of P119. In any case, he made no assertion that he was rushed by the IO and therefore made the mistake. He certainly could not say that he was not thinking about his family members when he added the unequivocal sentence in the first paragraph of P119 because one line down in the second paragraph, he mentioned his family members and later added “younger sister” in his handwriting. Further, the unequivocal sentence is about his own family-given nickname and no one will make such a glaring mistake unless the falsehood was entirely intentional. I therefore agree with the Judge’s observation that the clear inference to be drawn from this deliberate and unsolicited insertion in P119 is that Fadzli was trying to distance himself from Affandi and the drugs that were still in Affandi’s custody. This was because Affandi knew him as “Abut” and would almost certainly implicate him as the owner of the drugs. The Judge also took note of the evidence on DNA profiling and on the FCPL analysis (Judgment at [9] and [10]). However, quite surprisingly, he decided that both these strands of evidence did not really assist the Prosecution or the appellants and accordingly decided he would not refer to them any further (Judgment at [11]). No explanation was provided for this conclusion. The Judge subsequently acquitted Affandi on Charge G on the basis that although Affandi admitted in his contemporaneous statement that he had passed “a lot” of ice to Fadzli, it was not explained what he meant by that and there was no evidence of the amount of methamphetamine involved. The Judge also held that the Prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Affandi had passed Fadzli the four packets containing 38.84g of methamphetamine (Judgment at [80]–[81]). The Judge also acquitted Fadzli on Charge D because it was not clear where the methamphetamine came from. Although Affandi’s contemporaneous statement indicated that Fadzli had left some methamphetamine with him, it did not state that the 8.14g of methamphetamine was from Fadzli. Further, Affandi’s statement that he had bought methamphetamine from a Chinese man in Geylang was not seriously challenged by the Prosecution, leaving a reasonable doubt whether the methamphetamine recovered from Affandi originated from Fadzli. The Judge was also of the view that even if the methamphetamine had originated from Fadzli, there was no evidence that Fadzli had instigated Affandi to be in possession of it for the purpose of trafficking (Judgment at [119]–[120]). As the Prosecution has not appealed against these findings, I shall not discuss the correctness of the Judge’s decision to acquit Affandi and Fadzli on Charge G and Charge D respectively. However, the forensic evidence relating to the DNA profiling and the FCPL analysis corroborates strongly Affandi’s statement in P105 that he had passed a lot of the “Ice” to Fadzli on 12 July 2013 but Fadzli left some behind. Further, since “Ice” was passed between the two appellants that day, their meeting was not for the sole purpose of collecting the groceries as alleged. Mr Tiwary submits that to prove Charge A against Fadzli, the evidence must establish beyond reasonable doubt that it was Fadzli who instructed Affandi to collect the drugs and that his possession of the drugs after collection was on Fadzli’s instructions. He submits that the only evidence that supports this hypothesis is P105 and P115 but both statements are unreliable as confessions against Fadzli as they are inconsistent with each other and this means that Affandi is someone who is prone to tell lies.\n",

I therefore agree with the Judge’s observation that the clear inference to be drawn from this deliberate and unsolicited insertion in P119 is that Fadzli was trying to distance himself from Affandi and the drugs that were still in Affandi’s custody. This was because Affandi knew him as “Abut” and would almost certainly implicate him as the owner of the drugs. The Judge also took note of the evidence on DNA profiling and on the FCPL analysis (Judgment at [9] and [10]). However, quite surprisingly, he decided that both these strands of evidence did not really assist the Prosecution or the appellants and accordingly decided he would not refer to them any further (Judgment at [11]). No explanation was provided for this conclusion. The Judge subsequently acquitted Affandi on Charge G on the basis that although Affandi admitted in his contemporaneous statement that he had passed “a lot” of ice to Fadzli, it was not explained what he meant by that and there was no evidence of the amount of methamphetamine involved. The Judge also held that the Prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Affandi had passed Fadzli the four packets containing 38.84g of methamphetamine (Judgment at [80]–[81]). The Judge also acquitted Fadzli on Charge D because it was not clear where the methamphetamine came from. Although Affandi’s contemporaneous statement indicated that Fadzli had left some methamphetamine with him, it did not state that the 8.14g of methamphetamine was from Fadzli. Further, Affandi’s statement that he had bought methamphetamine from a Chinese man in Geylang was not seriously challenged by the Prosecution, leaving a reasonable doubt whether the methamphetamine recovered from Affandi originated from Fadzli. The Judge was also of the view that even if the methamphetamine had originated from Fadzli, there was no evidence that Fadzli had instigated Affandi to be in possession of it for the purpose of trafficking (Judgment at [119]–[120]). As the Prosecution has not appealed against these findings, I shall not discuss the correctness of the Judge’s decision to acquit Affandi and Fadzli on Charge G and Charge D respectively. However, the forensic evidence relating to the DNA profiling and the FCPL analysis corroborates strongly Affandi’s statement in P105 that he had passed a lot of the “Ice” to Fadzli on 12 July 2013 but Fadzli left some behind. Further, since “Ice” was passed between the two appellants that day, their meeting was not for the sole purpose of collecting the groceries as alleged. Mr Tiwary submits that to prove Charge A against Fadzli, the evidence must establish beyond reasonable doubt that it was Fadzli who instructed Affandi to collect the drugs and that his possession of the drugs after collection was on Fadzli’s instructions. He submits that the only evidence that supports this hypothesis is P105 and P115 but both statements are unreliable as confessions against Fadzli as they are inconsistent with each other and this means that Affandi is someone who is prone to tell lies.\n",

      " With regard to sentence, the three charges against Chander involved 29.96g, 14.79g and 19.27g of diamorphine (see [6] above). Given the quantities of diamorphine in question, Chander would have been liable to be sentenced to death in respect of two of these charges – the charge for trafficking by delivering the E bundles containing 19.27g of diamorphine to Harun as well as the charge for trafficking by giving the D bundles containing 29.96g of diamorphine to Ramesh. It follows that under s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA, the Judge was obliged to impose the sentence of life imprisonment in respect of two of these charges. As Chander had been sentenced in respect of three distinct offences, regardless of which sentences the Judge ordered to run consecutively, the Judge would have had to impose an overall term of life imprisonment. Thus, there is no reason to doubt the correctness of the sentence which the Judge imposed. We therefore dismiss Chander’s appeal. Therefore, we find that even though there is a reasonable possibility that Chander gave Ramesh the D bundles with a view to reclaiming possession of them, this would nevertheless have amounted to trafficking within the meaning of s 5(1)(a) of the MDA. The charge against Chander for trafficking in the D bundles is therefore made out beyond a reasonable doubt and we uphold Chander’s conviction on this count. Thus far, we have not discussed our decision relating to the charge against Chander concerning the D bundles because, as alluded to earlier, our findings in relation to Ramesh’s appeal have a bearing on this particular charge against Chander. Notwithstanding the fact that Chander did not dispute that the actus reus of the charge for trafficking in the D bundles was made out against him (since it is uncontroversial that he did transfer possession of them to Ramesh), given that these appeals arise from a joint trial, we must now consider the charge against Chander in the light of the finding that the evidence discloses a reasonable possibility that Chander gave Ramesh the D bundles with a view to later taking them back from Ramesh. For the foregoing reasons, we allow Ramesh’s appeal and convict him on the amended charge for possession of the D bundles under s 8(a) of the MDA.

      " Accordingly, we allow the appeal against conviction and acquit the Appellant of the charge against him. In all the circumstances, and for the reasons given above, we find that the Prosecution has failed to establish a key element of the offence of importation, namely, that the Appellant knew that the bundles of drugs in the suitcase were in his possession. This appeal highlights how important it is that the Prosecution and the Defence (and, indeed, the courts) remain alert to the precise effect and implications of conceding particular facts as to what the accused person did or did not know. We appreciate that this is by no means an easy and straightforward matter, and, in fairness to the Judge, he was not helped in the discharge of this difficult task by the fact that the Defence misunderstood the requirements of the element of possession and therefore wrongly conceded the fact of possession; while the Prosecution proceeded on the basis that the Appellant did not actually know of the existence of the drugs, before then seeking to have that very fact presumed to be true. Had the parties properly set out their respective cases at the trial below, it would have been clear that what was in issue was the fact of possession, and that given the Prosecution’s concession that the Appellant did not actually know of that fact, that fact could only be established by proof beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant had been wilfully blind to the existence of the drugs. Our final point concerns the anterior question of the circumstances under which the presumptions may be invoked. This point had a significant bearing on the present case, and the Prosecution would do well to be clear on how its case is run so as not to unwittingly foreclose recourse to the presumptions. The s 18 presumptions are presumptions of the fact of actual knowledge: they presume that the accused person actually knew the fact alleged against him. It stands to reason that the Prosecution may not invoke a statutory presumption as to the existence of a fact that it has, elsewhere, conceded does not exist. In short, the Prosecution will not be allowed to invoke the presumption under s 18(1) if it has run its case on the basis that the accused person did not actually know the fact in question. This would be so, for example, where the Prosecution’s case proceeds solely on the basis that the accused person had been wilfully blind (as was the case in the present appeal). For the same reason, the Prosecution should exercise particular care when putting its case to the accused person. If the point sought to be made is simply that the accused person had taken internally inconsistent positions in his evidence, care should be taken to ensure that the truth or falsity of a particular position is not put to the accused person.\n",

Accordingly, the Prosecution’s appeal in CCA 14 and Zuraimy’s appeal in CCA 18 are dismissed. As counsel for Moad Fadzir has given the confirmation sought, s 390(6) and (7) of the CPC have been complied with. In any case, we have read the above amended charge to Moad Fadzir and he has confirmed again before us today that his defence case remains the same and his evidence will be the same as that adduced during the trial in the High Court. The original charge against Moad Fadzir was a capital offence charge. The amended charge remains a capital offence charge. The changes relate only to the deletion of the references to common intention and the statutory provisions governing such, necessitated by the findings made by the Judge. We affirm the conviction and the mandatory death sentence based on this amended charge. Moad Fadzir’s appeal in CCA 12 is therefore dismissed. Since the Judge held that there was no common intention between Moad Fadzir and Zuraimy to possess diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking and had amended the original charge against Zuraimy, he ought to have amended Moad Fadzir’s charge as well by deleting the references to common intention. On the same day, after we heard the arguments in these appeals, we directed the Supreme Court Registry to send a letter to all parties to ask them whether they agree that in the event after considering the matter, this Court decides to dismiss the appeals and so affirm Moad Fadzir’s conviction for trafficking and Zuraimy’s conviction on the amended charge, the original charge against Moad Fadzir should be amended by deleting the words, “together with one Zuraimy bin Musa, NRIC No. XXXXXXXXX, in furtherance of the common intention of both of you” and “read with section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)”. We also asked counsel for Moad Fadzir, if the parties agree with the said amendments, for the purposes of s 390(6) and (7) of the CPC, whether he confirms, that the defence case will remain the same and the evidence of Moad Fadzir will be the same as that adduced during the trial in the High Court. The Registry has received the agreement and the confirmation sought. Zuraimy knew that he was aiding Moad Fadzir to possess diamorphine.

We will then hear the parties. Until then, Han is to remain in custody. In addition, the Framework has the advantage of resolving several difficult edgy situations in a manner that avoids intuitively unpalatable results:\n",
      "(a)     On the facts of Anderton (which the House of Lords in Shivpuri described (at 21) as a situation “which most people, as a matter of common sense, would not regard as involving criminality”), the accused person would not have been found liable for attempting to dishonestly handle stolen goods because, in truth, pursuant to the first stage of the Framework, what she intended to do was to buy a cheap video recorder. She was indifferent to whether or not the video recorder was stolen, even if she believed or mistakenly thought it might be, and so did not possess the requisite intent to commit the specific criminal act of dishonestly handling stolen goods. This aligns with the outcome arrived at by the majority of the House of Lords in Anderton, but without recourse to the unworkable distinction between “objectively innocent” and “guilty” acts (see [84] above), which fails to have regard to the need to be mindful of the intent behind the putative act, regardless of the act which the accused person in fact carried out.\n",
      "(b)     The House of Lords acquitted the accused person in Haughton of attempting to handle stolen goods (see [76] above), but under the Framework, he would have been convicted because the act that he intended to do was a crime in every sense of the word, and in the circumstances, it was not a crime only because the police had already taken custody of the stolen corned beef without his knowledge. The result in Haughton is intuitively unsatisfactory, and indeed, as we mentioned earlier (at [69] and [77] above), the controversy attributed to the decision has been credited with spurring the enactment of the CAA (UK): see Anderton at 981. This dissatisfaction stems from the fact, as we have just observed, that the accused person in Haughton (unlike the accused person in Anderton) specifically intended to deal with stolen goods. Yet, he was acquitted on the basis that “[c]onduct which is not criminal is not converted into criminal conduct by the accused believing that a state of affairs exists which does not exist” (see the extract from Haughton reproduced at [76] above). As we have explained at [98(d)] and [107] above, the premise that the criminality of an attempt to commit an offence arises out of the patent criminality of the act performed is erroneous, and this underlies what we respectfully consider to have been the error in Haughton. The Framework would realign the result of the decision in Haughton with the rationale behind punishing an accused person for a criminal attempt: in specifically intending to deal with stolen goods and coupling that specific intent with sufficient acts, the accused person in Haughton would be found, under the Framework, to be both morally and legally culpable, and therefore would be punished so as to deter him from further crime.\n",
      "(c)     In a situation where an accused person has sex with a girl over the age of 16 in the mistaken belief that she is under that age (see [79] above), whether he would be liable would turn on the question of his specific intent. If, by way of analogy with the facts in Anderton, he was indifferent to the actual age of the girl even if he mistakenly believed she might be underage, he would not be liable for attempting to commit statutory rape. Conversely, if the evidence demonstrates that he specifically targeted the girl because he thought she was under the age of 16 and would not have had sex with her otherwise, then he would be liable. This distinction would be justified on the basis of deterrence because the accused person in the latter situation would demonstrably be a danger to underage girls, which is precisely the danger that the applicable provisions are meant to protect against. He would also be more morally culpable and deserving of punishment in specifically intending to target a protected group of individuals.\n",
      "(d)     In the umbrella “theft” scenario (see [79] above), whether or not liability would attach would depend on the accused person’s specific intention. Did he intend to take an umbrella that was not his own? If so, he would be liable for a criminal attempt, even if, by mistake, he ended up taking his own umbrella. In that light, we turn to what we regard to be the correct approach, which, in our judgment, is, in broad terms, to align with the Australian jurisprudence and our own decision in Mas Swan. We approach impossible attempts through a two-stage framework that examines the intention of the accused person and whether there were sufficient acts that manifested that intention and the embarkation towards its consummation (“the Framework”). We elaborate on each of these as follows:\n",
      "(a)     Intention – Was there was a specific intention to commit a criminal act?\n",
      "(i)       The key questions in this regard are, in our judgment:\n",
      "(A)       What was the act that the accused person specifically intended to do?\n",
      "(B)       Was that intended act criminal, either on its face or by reason of some mistaken belief harboured by the accused person? Thus, the intended act of taking an umbrella may be criminal either because the accused person knows that the umbrella belongs to another or because he mistakenly believes it to be so.\n",
      "(ii)       The inquiry only proceeds to the second stage if the answer to (B) above is “yes”. This would sieve out situations where what the accused person intended to do was not an offence at all, meaning cases of no-offence impossibility, which, as we have noted, is commonly accepted not to give rise to criminal liability for attempt.\n",
      "(b)      Actus reus – Were there sufficient acts by the accused person in furtherance of the specific intention to commit the criminal act found under (a)? The inquiry here is directed at whether there were sufficient acts to reasonably corroborate the presence of that intention and demonstrate substantial movement towards its fulfilment. A conviction may only be arrived at if the answer to this is “yes”. This inquiry also serves to avoid penalising mere guilty intentions. The second situation is where the accused person has done all that he intended to do, but the primary offence has nonetheless not been consummated for some reason. Examples of this can be seen in Mas Swan, Haughton and Shivpuri. In each of these instances, the accused person was operating under a mistaken belief as to some fact. This mistaken belief lies at the heart of the problem of impossible attempts because it leads to dissonance between the accused person’s mens rea and his actus reus; or, in other words, between the primary act (and, consequently, the primary offence) that the accused person intended to carry out, and the act which he in fact carried out. In our respectful view, the error in the analysis undertaken in many of the cases has been to assume that the question of whether the accused person may be charged with attempting to commit an offence is to be assessed by reference to the act that he actually did, rather than by reference to the act that he intended to do. This is wrong. An attempt is criminalised because the intended (or attempted) act is illegal; and the imposition of a requirement that there be sufficient acts to corroborate the existence of that guilty intention serves not only as an evidentiary threshold, but also, and more importantly, as a safeguard to ensure that an accused person is not penalised purely for having a guilty intent. Seen in this light, cases involving impossible attempts must be resolved by focusing on the criminality of the intended act. If that is sufficiently established, it will not generally matter even if what the accused person in fact did would not objectively amount to an offence, such as if a would-be murderer stabbed a bolster mistakenly thinking it was his intended victim. The accused person’s acts are to be analysed against the guilty intent with which he set out, in order to corroborate that intent and establish a movement towards its fulfilment that the law regards as sufficient so as to filter out cases that reside, in truth, only in the guilty mind.\n",

This distinction would be justified on the basis of deterrence because the accused person in the latter situation would demonstrably be a danger to underage girls, which is precisely the danger that the applicable provisions are meant to protect against. He would also be more morally culpable and deserving of punishment in specifically intending to target a protected group of individuals.\n",
      "(d)     In the umbrella “theft” scenario (see [79] above), whether or not liability would attach would depend on the accused person’s specific intention. Did he intend to take an umbrella that was not his own? If so, he would be liable for a criminal attempt, even if, by mistake, he ended up taking his own umbrella. In that light, we turn to what we regard to be the correct approach, which, in our judgment, is, in broad terms, to align with the Australian jurisprudence and our own decision in Mas Swan. We approach impossible attempts through a two-stage framework that examines the intention of the accused person and whether there were sufficient acts that manifested that intention and the embarkation towards its consummation (“the Framework”). We elaborate on each of these as follows:\n",
      "(a)     Intention – Was there was a specific intention to commit a criminal act?\n",
      "(i)       The key questions in this regard are, in our judgment:\n",
      "(A)       What was the act that the accused person specifically intended to do?\n",
      "(B)       Was that intended act criminal, either on its face or by reason of some mistaken belief harboured by the accused person? Thus, the intended act of taking an umbrella may be criminal either because the accused person knows that the umbrella belongs to another or because he mistakenly believes it to be so.\n",
      "(ii)       The inquiry only proceeds to the second stage if the answer to (B) above is “yes”. This would sieve out situations where what the accused person intended to do was not an offence at all, meaning cases of no-offence impossibility, which, as we have noted, is commonly accepted not to give rise to criminal liability for attempt.\n",
      "(b)      Actus reus – Were there sufficient acts by the accused person in furtherance of the specific intention to commit the criminal act found under (a)? The inquiry here is directed at whether there were sufficient acts to reasonably corroborate the presence of that intention and demonstrate substantial movement towards its fulfilment. A conviction may only be arrived at if the answer to this is “yes”. This inquiry also serves to avoid penalising mere guilty intentions. The second situation is where the accused person has done all that he intended to do, but the primary offence has nonetheless not been consummated for some reason. Examples of this can be seen in Mas Swan, Haughton and Shivpuri. In each of these instances, the accused person was operating under a mistaken belief as to some fact. This mistaken belief lies at the heart of the problem of impossible attempts because it leads to dissonance between the accused person’s mens rea and his actus reus; or, in other words, between the primary act (and, consequently, the primary offence) that the accused person intended to carry out, and the act which he in fact carried out. In our respectful view, the error in the analysis undertaken in many of the cases has been to assume that the question of whether the accused person may be charged with attempting to commit an offence is to be assessed by reference to the act that he actually did, rather than by reference to the act that he intended to do. This is wrong. An attempt is criminalised because the intended (or attempted) act is illegal; and the imposition of a requirement that there be sufficient acts to corroborate the existence of that guilty intention serves not only as an evidentiary threshold, but also, and more importantly, as a safeguard to ensure that an accused person is not penalised purely for having a guilty intent. Seen in this light, cases involving impossible attempts must be resolved by focusing on the criminality of the intended act. If that is sufficiently established, it will not generally matter even if what the accused person in fact did would not objectively amount to an offence, such as if a would-be murderer stabbed a bolster mistakenly thinking it was his intended victim. The accused person’s acts are to be analysed against the guilty intent with which he set out, in order to corroborate that intent and establish a movement towards its fulfilment that the law regards as sufficient so as to filter out cases that reside, in truth, only in the guilty mind.\n",

      " At the hearing of the appeal, the Prosecution submitted that it would disclose to the Defence the statements of Sufian, Faizal, Mashitta and the Helper if we held that it was under a duty to do so. In that event, if the Defence decided to call these witnesses, it was suggested that the matter could be remitted to the Judge pursuant to s 390(1)(b)(i) of the CPC. To be clear, our judgment in this appeal does not turn on the Prosecution’s non-disclosure of these witnesses’ statements. We have found that it was the Prosecution, and not the Defence, who ought to have called these witnesses, given its evidential burden to rebut the claims made by the Appellant. As the Prosecution has failed to prove that the Appellant is guilty of either of the two capital trafficking charges that it brought against him, there is simply no basis for this matter to be remitted to the Judge. Further, we allow the Appellant’s appeal in relation to the second charge of trafficking in the cannabis and acquit him of it. In summary, having examined the facts and the evidence before us, we allow the Appellant’s appeal in relation to the first charge of trafficking in the diamorphine, and convict him on an amended charge of possession of the diamorphine under s 8(a) of the MDA. We sentence him to a term of eight years’ imprisonment, backdated to the date of his remand, on the amended charge. Second, in criminal proceedings, there are strict rules of procedure which provide that it is for the Prosecution to first prove a prima facie case before the Defence may be called or even invited to set out material aspects of its position. Section 230(1)(j) of the CPC provides that the court may only call on an accused person to give his defence if it is satisfied that there is some evidence which is not inherently incredible and which, if accepted, would satisfy each and every element of the charge against the accused person. In the course of the Prosecution’s case, a judge should therefore not ask questions of the Defence which would require the accused person to give advance notice of his case before he is called to give his defence, given that at this stage, the Prosecution would have yet to discharge its burden to prove a prima facie case.\n",

As there has therefore been no consideration of the facts pertaining to the methamphetamine, we do not think it appropriate to consider amending the charge against Azli. It is a matter for the Prosecution to consider whether it wishes to pursue any charge in that respect and we say nothing more on that. For completeness, we should also mention that there is one further element of the offence of abetment by intentionally aiding (set out at [46] above) which the Prosecution has also failed to satisfy. That is the need to establish, that beyond having knowledge of the nature of the Drugs, Azli was aware that Roszaidi intended to traffic in diamorphine (see also Ramesh a/l Perumal ([11] supra) at [115]). It should be noted that the case against Azli was one of purely accessorial liability. If Azli had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2), he would have been liable for the offence of possession of a controlled drug, namely diamorphine. But to make him liable as an accessory to trafficking is a wholly different matter. It would have been necessary to show that Azli knew that Roszaidi was engaging him for assistance not only to collect diamorphine but that he was also doing this for the purpose of trafficking. The only piece of evidence that pointed directly to this conclusion was Roszaidi’s account in his statements (see [102] above), which we have found to be unreliable (see [105] above). The remaining evidence demonstrates, at best, only that Azli knew of Roszaidi’s involvement in drug trafficking in general, as opposed to his having known of and agreed to assist Roszaidi in trafficking in diamorphine at the material time of the offence. We refer here, for example, to the drug paraphernalia Azli had procured for Roszaidi (see [84] above), and Azli’s reference to Roszaidi’s “customer” (see [77] above), the significance of which is in any case doubtful (see [83] above). As such, the Prosecution has failed to prove that Azli knew at the material times that Roszaidi intended to traffic in the Drugs. For this reason also, Azli’s conviction cannot stand. As a result, the Prosecution has not established the element of knowledge against Azli. For the same reason, no lesser offence involving diamorphine, such as that of possession of a controlled drug, can be made out against him: see Adili at [35]. We therefore allow Azli’s appeal and acquit him of the charge. We have found that s 18(4) of the MDA is satisfied in relation to Azli, because he knew of and consented to Roszaidi bringing controlled drugs into his car and proceeded to transport Roszaidi on this basis. Azli is therefore presumed to know the nature of the Drugs pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA. However, we have found that Azli has rebutted the s 18(2) presumption. For the same reasons, there is no evidentiary basis for a finding that Azli had actual knowledge of or was wilfully blind to the nature of the Drugs.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, the Importation of Cannabis Mixture Charge cannot stand, and we set aside the Appellant’s conviction on this charge. This does not, however, affect his conviction on the Importation of Cannabis Charge for the reasons explained above. We also see no basis for disturbing the sentence meted out by the Judge for that charge. Accordingly, the sentence which the Appellant now has to serve is the sentence for the Importation of Cannabis Charge, namely, life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. For these reasons, we allow the Appellant’s appeal against his conviction on the Importation of Cannabis Mixture Charge and set that aside. We also find that the Prosecution’s Dual Charging Practice is indefensible and, hence, impermissible. As we have mentioned above at [107], this charging option would not prejudice the offender as the penalties for offences involving cannabis mixture are less severe than those for offences involving pure cannabis of the same weight. The effect of this charging option is to treat as cannabis mixture even plant material which the HSA analyst subjectively believes to consist of cannabis, but which does not satisfy the relevant criteria for certification as cannabis. In our view, this is simply a consequence of the difference between what may be thought to be the reality of the situation and what can be proved in court. For the avoidance of doubt, in either situation, the Prosecution would of course have to establish all the elements of the offence, such as those set out at [185] above. In our judgment, these submissions by the Prosecution do not address the two points we have highlighted at [186]–[187] above. Charges cannot be brought on the basis of approximations. In order to establish a drug importation charge, it is incumbent on the Prosecution to prove that the accused person knew the nature of the drugs in question, and to establish accurately the relevant drug involved at the time of the offence. These are difficulties that the Prosecution cannot surmount where the drugs in question consist of cannabis-related plant material containing both cannabis and cannabis mixture, and they affect the Dual Charging Practice generally, and in this case specifically, the Importation of Cannabis Mixture Charge.\n",

As for the remaining two categories of evidence (see [109(b)]–[109(c)] above), we were not satisfied that they met the requirement of relevance.

We did not see anything on the face of the evidence to suggest any such motive on the part of Mr Pang.
