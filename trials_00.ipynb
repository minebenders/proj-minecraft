They, however, rejected the submission made on behalf of the appellants that bringing drugs into Singapore with a view solely of exporting them would not be an offence under s 7 of the Act. They also rejected Ko’s defence that he did not know that what he was carrying was diamorphine. Accordingly, they convicted the appellants. Against the convictions, this appeal was brought. At the conclusion we dismissed it, and we now give our reasons.Ground (a) can be disposed of very briefly. By s 18(2) of the Act a rebuttable presumption arose that Ko knew the nature of the drug that he was carrying. Once the presumption arose, the onus of discharging it was on Ko. Having heard Ko’s defence, the trial judges were satisfied that he had not discharged the presumption. We have reviewed the record and it is clear that the trial judges were entitled on the evidence before them to arrive at this finding. We saw no reason to interfere.and submitted that s 7 was applicable only when it was sought to punish a master or captain who had contravened s 20. We could not accept that submission. In common with a number of other similar provisions in the Act, what s 20 does is to raise a presumption as to knowledge. By s 20, if it is proved that a drug was found in a ship or aircraft, then the presumption would arise that the drug was imported in the ship or aircraft with the knowledge of the master or captain. No doubt, in such a case, a master or captain may be charged for violating s 7 of the Act but that does not mean to say that s 7 is confined in its operations only to the master of a ship or captain of an aircraft used for the import of drugs. We see no reason why s 7 should not operate against (say) a passenger in a ship or aircraft who was importing drugs. Against such a passenger the presumption under s 20 as to knowledge would obviously not be applicable but (as in this case) the presumption under s 18(2) would apply.\",\n",

      " At the close of the case for the Prosecution, the Defence did not make any submission. We were of the view that Prosecution had made out a prima facie case which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction of the charges in the alternative and we called upon the accused to enter upon his defence. We administered the usual allocution. The accused elected to give evidence on oath. Accordingly, we convicted the accused of the offence of attempting to export to Australia the diamorphine in the quantity as charged contrary to s 7 read with s 12 of the Act. We stood down the alternative charge. We sentenced him to death. Sgt John Cheong Ging Thow arrived at Holding Room D63 at about 5.25pm. He was briefed by the police officers. He saw the accused and approached him. He checked his waist band and touched it. It was soft. He then recited his questioning and the answers of the accused. Counsel did not challenge the voluntary nature of the answers of the accused. Sgt John Cheong said he asked the accused what the contents were. The accused kept quiet. He asked him again in English, to which the accused replied: “drugs”. He said the accused pointed to the bags in his thighs. Sgt Cheong then asked him who had asked him to carry the drugs and the accused replied that it was an Australian by the name “John”. Sgt John Cheong said that he recorded the conversation in his pocket diary, which he read in court and which counsel for the Defence examined. He said he recorded thus: “On questioning him the male Chinese admitted he is carrying drugs for one Australian named John.” The sergeant stated in evidence that he did not tell IO Chew Khai Chow about this conversation and that was the reason why he did not mention this conversation in his statement at the preliminary inquiry. Sgt John Cheong also said in evidence that he asked the accused if he knew the punishment for carrying drugs. At first the accused kept quiet. He then asked him if he knew the sentence or not. The accused then said: “Hang”. In cross-examination, Sgt John Cheong denied defence suggestion that the accused had said that he was told that he was carrying Chinese medicine.\n",

      " In so far as it was alleged that the written statement was not recorded in compliance with s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), a careful assessment of the evidence drove us to the conclusion that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the requirements of the section were complied with. We were satisfied that both the charge and the warning were interpreted and explained to the accused, and we were particularly impressed with the evidence of the interpreter, Abdul Razak, in these respects. The accused’s evidence was that SNO Jamaludin was the author of the statement; that none of it fell from the lips of the accused; that he had signed the paper (P14) bearing the handwritten charge, the warning, and the acknowledgements four times in one fell swoop, at the behest of SNO Jamaludin because he was fed up and wished to be taken down to the lock-up. We regarded this account as outlandish, and we disbelieved it, preferring the evidence of SNO Jamaludin and Abdul Razak. We have indicated areas in the prosecution case which gave us pause, lest it be said that we failed to take account of them, but having regard to the evidence as whole, in particular Jamala’s evidence in so far as it bore on the importation of the drugs, the accused’s voluntary oral and written statements, and our assessment of the accused’s credibility, we were satisfied of the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. We convict him as charged. Following the conclusion of the closing submissions, we considered the evidence. There were certain features of the prosecution case, which we noted, and of which we took careful account. They were:\n",
      "(a)     despite the fact that Jamala’s passport was recovered from the flat, and that at or about the same time the accused told SNO Jamaludin that he had brought the drugs into Singapore from Malaysia that morning, the accused was not asked for the passport he had used, no passport was recovered, and there was no evidence that the accused had disposed of a passport following his return to Singapore. Jamala said that she saw the accused’s passport lying on a bed in the flat after she and the accused had returned, but no member of the raiding party saw it; SNO Jamaludin made no inquiries as to whether a passport had ever been issued to the accused or, if one was issued, whether it had ever been confiscated on any one of the three occasions when the accused was sent to the DRC;\n",
      "(b)     SNO Jamaludin returned to the flat after escorting the accused, Jamala and Yusoff to CNB. He did so to supervise the taking of photographs and, according to him, to search for the accused’s passport. He had said nothing about a search for the passport at the preliminary inquiry, and ANO Lim Thian Siew, who accompanied him on this visit to the flat, said that there was no search;\n",
      "(c)     Jamala could not remember the name of any one of the four hotels she and the accused had checked into in Malaysia, despite the fact that they had stayed in Penang for (as it emerged) at least four days, and in Johore for three;\n",
      "(d)     although they had gone to Penang for a holiday, Jamala spent the best part of her time there in her hotel room, or that of the accused;\n",
      "(e)     Jamala said that the accused chose to take possession of, and pay for, the drugs in the carpark of the hotel in Penang in broad daylight, in public view, without even bothering to get into the car in which the accused’s friend had driven up;\n",
      "(f)     Jamala was for some reason drawn to the hotel window on the fourth floor at which she remained for some 25min, and from which she was able to observe the two-inch thick stack of notes which the accused passed to his friend in exchange for the bag containing the drugs;\n",
      "(g)     despite the fact of having visited Johore Bahru between 40 and 50 occasions in the 15 or so months before October 1986, Jamala was not only unable to name the hotel in that town in which she and the accused stayed, but was also unable to state its location;\n",
      "(h)     Jamala was unable to give any explanation, or at any rate any explanation that convinced us, for her numerous previous visits to Johore Bahru, bearing in mind that she neither worked nor lived there;\n",
      "(i)     since Jamala could not have expected the accused to throw the package out of the train window, and bearing in mind the speed at which the train was travelling, the darkness of the hour and the nature of the lighting on the overhead bridge, Jamala was able to observe with great clarity not only the accused’s actions, but Yusoff standing in the vicinity of the overhead bridge and responding to the accused’s gestures;\n",
      "(j)     although Jamala had been afraid of returning to Singapore with the accused when she realised that he had purchased drugs in Penang, and sought to distance herself from him on the train, she readily returned to the flat with him, making no effort to go back to her parents’ home close by; and no suitcase was found in the flat; and no evidence was led as to who, if anyone, paid rent for the flat after its registered occupant died in 1984;\n",
      "(k)     although, on the prosecution case, Yusoff was prima facie an abettor of the offence with which the accused was charged, SNO Jamaludin chose not to charge him and sent him to DRC on the day following his arrest;\n",
      "(l)     a DPP decided to withdraw the charge against Jamala. He gave no reason to SNO Jamaludin for his decision to do so, and following her acquittal she gave evidence for the Prosecution at the preliminary inquiry and at the trial;\n",
      "(m)     Jamala’s allegations that the accused’s father attempted to bribe her; that she was assaulted by the young Chinese men; and that she was threatened by the accused’s younger brother were never investigated; and\n",
      "(n)     SNO Jamaludin did not carry out any investigations in Malaysia with a view to ascertaining whether the accused had been in that country between 1 October and 9 October 1986. Little more than six weeks later, namely, on 1 December 1986, Jamala was produced in court. The charge against her was withdrawn, and she was discharged, her discharge amounting to an acquittal. Shortly after her acquittal she was served with a subpoena to give evidence on behalf of the Prosecution at the preliminary inquiry, which was held on 8 July 1987. She duly did so.\n",

      " For the reasons we have given, we find that on the facts and on the law the Prosecution has proved its case against both of you without any reasonable doubt. We find both of you guilty as charged and we convict you accordingly. Section 18(2) of the Act provides that any person who has in his possession a controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. You were found in possession of drugs on your body and accordingly the onus of discharging that presumption lies on you. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. In our view, for the reasons we have given, you have not proved, on a balance of probabilities, that you did not know the nature of the drugs you were carrying. You had a lot of time and many opportunities to find out whether you were being asked to carry drugs to Amsterdam. You had suspicions that it was drugs that you were being asked to carry and you made no effort to find out in a more positive manner what the vest contained. We do not think that the presumption that you know the nature of the drug has been rebutted by your failure to enquire further, after having had suspicions that it could be drugs that you were being asked to carry. What we have just recounted is the evidence adduced by the Prosecution at the close of its case against both of you. On this evidence, we found that the Prosecution has made out a case against both of you which, if unrebutted, would have warranted your convictions. Accordingly, we called on both of you to enter on your defence. Both of you elected to give evidence in the witness box. The DPP also referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in R v Smith (Donald) [1973] QB 924 where it was held that for the purpose of showing that a person has committed the offence being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition against the importation of cannabis imposed by the Dangerous Drugs Act 1965, contrary to s 304(b) of the Customs and Excise Act 1952, it is sufficient to prove that he had been a party to the importation of the cannabis into the United Kingdom as a staging post for onward transmission to another country, and that it was unnecessary to show that he had done anything in the United Kingdom to further the transaction. Accordingly, the appellant was held to have been properly convicted when he arranged for cannabis to be transferred from an aircraft which had landed at Heathrow Airport to another waiting aircraft bound for Bermuda.\n",

      " We should add that we did not consider it necessary or relevant to decide whether the accused had brought the heroin back with him from Kuala Lumpur, as the charge against him was for trafficking by transporting within Singapore. We therefore made no finding on this question. However, we found that the accused had not rebutted the presumption that he was in possession of the drugs from Lorong 1A, Toa Payoh to Jalan Novena Barat for the purpose of trafficking and we therefore found him to be guilty as charged and sentenced him to the mandatory death penalty. The accused now appeals against the conviction. We found that there was evidence that the accused was in possession of the briefcase containing the three packets of diamorphine, and that the diamorphine was being transported by him from Lorong 1A, Toa Payoh to Jalan Novena Barat in the taxi. Under the Act several rebuttable presumptions arise on these facts. Firstly, s 18(1)(a) raises the presumption that the accused was in possession of the diamorphine in the briefcase. Secondly, he was presumed under s 17 to be in possession of the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking as the weight of the diamorphine was more than 2g. We therefore found that the Prosecution had sufficiently proved a case, which if unrebutted, would warrant the accused’s conviction and we called him to enter his defence. The accused was tried before us and convicted on a charge of trafficking by transporting not less than 68.6g of diamorphine from Lorong 1A, Toa Payoh to Jalan Novena Barat in taxi SH 6207 P on 7 October 1988. The charge was under s 5(a) and punishable under s 32 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”).\n",

      " We found nothing to raise even the slightest doubt as to the guilt of both the accused persons. Their acts were conscious, willed and intended. We found in the circumstances that the Prosecution had proven the offence imputed to both the accused conclusively, and finding no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of both persons, we found them guilty as charged and imposed the only punishment prescribed under the Act, ie the death penalty. Since Ng and Hsui declined to give any evidence on their behalf, we invited counsel to make their closing submissions to enable us to consider, as we must, whether the Prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. In his final submission on behalf of the first accused, counsel for Ng submitted that no case beyond reasonable doubt had been established by the Prosecution at the conclusion of the trial. Counsel in the main relied on Ng’s s 122(6) statement and submitted that Ng did not intend to import the prohibited drugs into Singapore. Counsel particularly referred the court to that part of the statement by Ng where Ng said “I did not intend to come to Singapore. I was merely on transit to Brussels.” The essence of his submission was that Ng had remained in the transit lounge throughout awaiting the flight to Brussels expected to depart at 6.15pm on that day. Counsel submitted that so long as Ng had not [crossed] the immigration or the customs barrier, the offence of “importing into Singapore” would not have been made out. Counsel for Hsui adopted fully the arguments advanced on behalf of Ng in regard to the meaning to be ascribed to the word “import”. Counsel for Hsui also contended that the Prosecution had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that Hsui intentionally brought the diamorphine into Singapore without authorisation and for the purpose of delivering to someone in Singapore. He submitted that the facts adduced by the Prosecution showed that Hsui intended to leave Singapore for Brussels at 6.15pm on the same day. Counsel placed great reliance on the s 122(6) statement of the second accused where he said “I merely pass by Singapore and intend to take a flight to Brussel[s]. I did not know that by doing this, I have entered Singapore. This is the first time I travelled.” Counsel further invited us to depart from the decision of Chan Sek Keong J in PP v Ko Mun Cheung ([21] supra) and the principles stated therein. We rejected those submissions for the same reasons as we rejected the submissions of counsel for the first accused.\n",

      " In the result, the first accused had not succeeded in rebutting the case which had been made out. I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and I therefore found him guilty, convicted him of the charge and imposed the only penalty applicable in this case, ie the death penalty. Given the circumstances and the applicable law, I came to the view that it would be unreasonable to call for the defence of the second accused. I therefore rejected the submission made on behalf of the Prosecution and held that there was no prima facie case made against the second accused and that the Prosecution had clearly failed to establish each essential element of the offence against her. In the result, the second accused was discharged and acquitted at the end of the prosecution case. It should be presently noted that the court in evaluating whatever circumstantial evidence is placed before it should not lose sight of the aspect that at the close of the prosecution case, it ought not ask itself the question whether the Prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt but needs only to satisfy itself whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which would establish each essential ingredient of the charge. Counsel for Wong, the first accused, after the close of the prosecution case, submitted that there was no case for the first accused to answer. His submission was that the Prosecution had not proved all the ingredients of the said charge in that it had not established common intention between the parties nor had the Prosecution proved any attempt on the part of the first accused to export drugs from Singapore. Counsel submitted that so long as the flight SQ36 did not take off from the Singapore airport, the offence of attempt to export would not have been made out and, at worst, the first accused would have made only a mere preparation towards an attempt to export. Counsel added that the Prosecution had not proved that the first accused was the owner of the black “Gucci” bag. He then went on to contend that Dr Saw’s evidence should be disregarded as Dr Saw had delegated some of his tasks to his subordinates.\n",

      " The meaning of possession has been clarified in Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311, a Court of Criminal Appeal decision. The appellate court gave the word the meaning given to it by Lord Pearce in Warner v Metropolitan Commissioner [1969] 2 AC 256. Lord Pearce stated that possession of a packet constituted a strong prima facie case of possession of its contents. The presumption could be discharged if the person proved or raised a reasonable doubt as for example in the following circumstances:\n",
      "(a)     that the person was a bailee or servant and had no right to open or had no reason to suspect that the contents of the packet were illicit or drugs;\n",
      "(b)     that he had received the packet innocently and had no reasonable opportunity since its receipt of opening it or acquainting himself with its contents;\n",
      "(c)     that the offending article had been planted on him without his knowledge. The presumed fact of trafficking under s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) therefore became conclusive and it was sufficient for me to decide the case with that fact so presumed. However, there were in addition the proved facts. As a result, I accepted the Prosecution’s case. I believed as reasonably true the Prosecution’s submissions based on the proved and presumed facts that the accused was receiving drugs in bulk from Malaysia and repackaging them in smaller amounts for disposal by one or more of the methods defined in the word “traffic” in s 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act in view of the drugs and drug related paraphernalia found in his room. In my opinion, the operation of the presumption of trafficking did not require the spelling out of a specific method of trafficking. The word “traffic” by its several definitions encompasses an act of dealing with drugs and it is this activity amongst others which the legislation vigorously proscribes. The proved facts and the presumed facts complemented one another in proving the charge. Defence counsel in submitting as he did therefore overlooked the purpose, practical operation and effect of a legal presumption. In my opinion, the presumption under s 17 obviates the necessity on the part of the Prosecution to overtly prove the act or the state of affairs denoting the activity referred to in s 2 of the Act. The presumption, which is rebuttable, provides prima facie proof of the required criminal elements once possession with knowledge of the controlled drug above the stipulated amount (more than 2g in the case of diamorphine) is proved thereby escalating the act of illicit possession to one of trafficking. Where the amount involved is more than 15g of diamorphine, the offence becomes capital under the Act. Accordingly, I found the accused guilty as charged and convicted him and sentenced him to the mandatory death sentence.\n",

      " We found hardly anything to raise a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of both accused persons. It is our finding that they knew they were carrying drugs (which on analysis proved to be diamorphine of a huge proportion) and they knew that they were going to arrive in Singapore and in those circumstances, we are satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In his final submission on behalf of Tse, counsel submitted that Tse did not intend to import into Singapore the drugs seized from him at the Singapore Airport and that he did not know what he was carrying was diamorphine. It was submitted to us that whatever was found in Tse’s possession was intended for delivery outside Singapore. He was, we were told, in Singapore only on transit en route to Amsterdam. Counsel submitted that the Prosecution had not satisfied the necessary ingredients of the charge preferred against Tse; in particular, it had failed to prove that Tse intentionally imported into Singapore the said 2,178g of diamorphine. Counsel also urged the court to reject the prosecution evidence that Tse mentioned to them when he was apprehended that what he was carrying was “pak fun”. In our view, the Prosecution had proved that the accused persons had the quantities of diamorphine specified in the charge strapped to their calves and thighs and hidden in their shoes when apprehended at the Changi Airport on that day. There was no dispute concerning the nature or quantity of the drug, ie the diamorphine seized. As to the contention that he did not utter the words “pak fun”, again in the absence of his evidence, we are left with only the evidence of the Prosecution that Tse did make that statement and the phrase “pak fun” meant “white powder” which in turn denoted heroin. Tse did not avail himself of the opportunity to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution evidence. We accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses that when questioned about the nature of the substance found on him, Tse had said “pak fun”. We also accepted that the words “pak fun” in the Cantonese dialect denotes heroin.\n",

      " The Prosecution had proved that the accused was in possession of the diamorphine and that he had brought it into Singapore. As neither defence he raised was effectual and did not raise any reasonable doubt in the prosecution case, I found him guilty and convicted him, and imposed the mandatory death sentence on him. On the defence of ignorance, there has to be more than ignorance that there was diamorphine in the blocks. The accused knew that he had the blocks on him. In Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner ([19] supra), Lord Pearce held that when a person has something in his control “the term ‘possession’ is satisfied by a knowledge only of the existence of the thing itself and not its qualities, and the ignorance or mistake as to its qualities is not an excuse”. With regard to things in packages, his Lordship held that there is a strong inference that a person in possession of a package is in possession of its contents. This inference is discharged if he proves (or raises a real doubt in the matter) either (a) that he was a servant or bailee who had no right to open it and no reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were drugs; or (b) that although he was the owner he had no knowledge of (including a genuine mistake as to) its actual contents or of their illicit nature and that he received them innocently and also that he had had no reasonable opportunity since receiving the package of acquainting himself with its actual contents. For a man takes over a package or suitcase at risk as to its contents being unlawful if he does not immediately examine it (if he is entitled to do so). As soon as may be he should examine it and if he finds the contents suspicious reject possession by either throwing them away or by taking immediate sensible steps for their disposal. At the close of the prosecution case, I found that the Prosecution had proved a prima facie case that the accused was in possession of the diamorphine in accordance with the principles set out in Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 2 AC 256 and Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311 and that he imported the drug into Singapore by bringing it into the territory of Singapore – see Ko Mun Cheung v PP [1992] 1 SLR(R) 887, Ng Kwok Chun v PP [1992] 3 SLR(R) 256 and Tse Po Chung Nathan v PP [1993] 1 SLR(R) 308.

ASP Toh had not said that the disclosure of the directive was inimical to the public interest, and I saw no reason to suppose that it would. The argument is that the death sentence cannot be imposed without regard to the degree of moral blameworthiness of the convicted person, and that the court must treat an offender with little or no blameworthiness differently from a blameworthy offender when it imposes a sentence. Parliament has prescribed the offence, the type and quantity of drugs as the bases to determine the sentences to be meted out to offenders. By its preamble the Misuse of Drugs Act was enacted “for the control of dangerous drugs or otherwise harmful drugs and substances and for purposes connected therewith”. The differentiating factors employed for the death sentence are not arbitrary, and they bear a reasonable relation to the object of the Act.\n",

      " On 22 September 2006, I convicted Tan of the charge and sentenced him in accordance with the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). I now set out my reasons. If the facts of the case merely show that he was uncommonly stupid, unconventionally ignorant, extremely naïve or plainly reckless in failing to determine the nature of what he was carrying, the accused is entitled to an acquittal. Put another way, it is legitimate for the courts to infer from an accused’s failure to check that this was because he already knew or was virtually certain of the nature of the drugs he was importing; but if the failure to inspect was, for instance, because he had recklessly or unreasonably relied on someone else’s assurance he is not guilty of a violation of the MDA as it is presently drafted and stands. Thus a person is not guilty if he can prove that though he may be in possession or control of a controlled drug he did not know of the nature of the drug. The mens rea or the subjective element of guilt is absent in such a case. The MDA, it must also be remembered, prescribes varying levels of punishment depending on the class of drugs imported. This itself unequivocally signals that Parliament did not intend to target, brand and punish all manner of drug traffickers with a single broad brush. Accordingly, it stands to reason that an accused who is punished for importing heroin should have known that he is importing heroin, and not some other drug. If an accused honestly believed on the other hand that he was importing only Ecstasy (or some other drug), it would be incorrect to penalise him for importing heroin. To do so would be to convert s 7 of the MDA into a strict liability provision, a notion which the cases have emphatically rejected and which is inimical to the intent of the MDA. Of course, it has never been the position that an accused may escape conviction simply because he was ignorant of the exact chemical or physical properties of the drug; nor must it necessarily be proved that he knew the drug by its name or the classification it fell under or the punishment associated with that particular type of drug. All that can be said is that the purported lack of knowledge of any of these may well lead a court to conclude that the accused did not know the nature of the drug he had imported; but that need not invariably be the case. Much will turn on the specific factual matrix before the court. If an accused chooses for profit to deal with any manner of controlled drugs, it bears emphasis that he has chosen of his own volition to engage in a dangerous business and generally speaking to accept the attendant risks. The courts have to approach these matters with pragmatism laced with a good dose of common sense, I can only add that a court, in assessing whether an accused knew enough about the nature of what he was carrying, must be guided by the fact that a finding that an accused knew the nature of the drug he was importing or trafficking may lead to extremely severe penalties including capital punishment. I doubt that the articulation of precise or rigid formula with greater specificity will assist further. It may, on the contrary, only lead to unintended results. The second point is this. Even if I was wrong to hold that Tan knew (and/or has failed to disprove that he knew) that he was importing heroin, I was persuaded that he had been wilfully blind to the obvious fact that he was carrying heroin. The picture portrayed by the evidence is that of a man desperately in need of money. He approached, without instigation or encouragement, his friend to ask for lobangs in the drug trafficking business. He claims to have asked only to be involved in the trafficking of Ecstasy within Malaysia; but this alone inherently demonstrates both knowledge of the assortment of drugs available and of the potential severity of punishment for smuggling drugs into Singapore. Yet, despite his professed willingness to traffic only drugs that would attract a lower sentence, he did not flinch when Uncle purportedly responded by holding up three fingers when he asked what drugs he was carrying. It may be reasonably inferred from the fact that he was prepared to traffic Ecstasy that he knew what Ecstasy looked like. Moreover, he admitted during cross-examination that he read the newspapers regularly enough to know that trafficking heroin attracted the death penalty. Tan must have known that the yellowish powder could not have been Ecstasy; he even accepted it was “number 3”. That Tan did not press on with his inquiry concerning the nature of the drug even while he asked a barrage of other questions regarding how he was going to carry so many packets of drugs, whether he looked too bulky because of the drugs, and where he was supposed to deliver them to, inter alia, shows that if he did not already know that he was carrying heroin, he was virtually certain that it was heroin but wilfully chose to turn a blind eye. This is not a case of a trafficker recklessly or negligently relying on an assurance that the drugs were not serious; Uncle had given what Tan himself understood as an affirmative indication that the drugs were “number 3” drugs. The inexorable inferences from all these facts is that Tan must have known clearly, or else, at the very least, chose to be wilfully blind to the fact that he was importing heroin.\n",

      " The accused was convicted of the four charges at the end of the trial. The rest of the stood down charges were dealt with by me on a global basis for the purposes of sentencing. In total, the accused was sentenced to 23 years and 24 months of imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane (by virtue of section 230 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)). He has since appealed against his conviction in respect of the four charges and is serving sentence currently. Shirley was already serving her sentence at the time of her testimony in court. In my view, there was no reason for her to lie in the hope of obtaining a lighter sentence: see Lee Cher Chiang v PP [1998] 3 SLR 545 and Ramli bin Daud v PP [1996] 3 SLR 225. Just because she was ‘shocked’ by her sentence of 21 years and had implicated the accused did not mean that she must have had an axe to grind and therefore was prepared to perjure in order to exact revenge. It was more plausible that she was telling the truth simply because she had nothing more to lose or gain by doing so. The court had been informed in the middle of the trial that defence would not be disputing the amounts of drugs that the accused had admitted to in his statements and that at the end of the day, they would be urging this court to reduce the weight of the drugs as reflected in the charges and convict the accused accordingly. In the defence submissions tendered to the court, it was argued, however, that it would be unfair for the court to pluck a figure out of thin air to do the apportionment in amending the charge. As such, the defence submitted that the accused should be acquitted. I agreed with the prosecution that there were a number of aggravating factors in the accused’s case. He was obviously the main trafficker who had obtained the drugs in Room 1123 for the purposes of sale to others. He had also absconded while on court bail. These factors should translate into higher sentences than what had been imposed on Shirley. Nevertheless, I kept in mind that even if the same number of years of imprisonment were imposed, the punishment meted out to the accused for each of the charges under section 5(a) of MDA would have been higher by virtue of the fact that he was a male and therefore would have to suffer mandatory caning. His overall sentence should also be higher than that imposed on Shirley as he was charged with a number of other charges that were unconnected to Shirley.\n",

      " The social object to the Misuse of Drugs Act is to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore and the legislature has seen it fit to provide for different penalties for possession, trafficking, importing and other offences under the Act. Counsel for the defence was wrong when he submitted that “the punishments prescribed for trafficking and importing are identical”. Whilst the minimum punishments for importing and trafficking in Class A drugs are similar, the minimum punishments for importing and trafficking in Class B and Class C drugs are not the same. The minimum punishments for importing Class B and Class C drugs are higher than for trafficking in the similar drugs (5 years and 5 strokes for importing a Class B drug and 3 years and 3 strokes for trafficking in a Class B drug. For importing a Class C drug, the minimum sentence is 3 years and 5 strokes and for trafficking, it is 2 years and 2 strokes). As mentioned earlier, the High Court in PP vs. Ko Mun Cheng has ruled on the definition of “import” in the Misuse of Drugs Act and there was absolutely no reason for the court to agree with defence counsel that an offence under Section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act would not be committed unless the importer intended to deliver the controlled drug to other parties.

      " .       The motive that the defence is relying on is that the trafficking charge against Haslindah had been reduced to one of possession in exchange for her evidence implicating Hisham in the Subutex transaction. On analysing the evidence, I am satisfied that there is credible evidence proving that Haslindah has no reason to falsely implicate Hisham. They were former childhood friends. Hisham was also a friend of her husband. Her childhood friendship with Hisham was renewed sometime in the year 2000 when her husband “introduced” him to her. The evidence also revealed that they had a very close and cordial relationship after that. Hisham had gone to her flat to gratuitously help her move an air-conditioned unit. He had also helped to dispose of some unwanted furniture from her flat. He had acted as her confidant in matters concerning herself and her husband. I am convinced that she has nothing to gain from falsely implicating Hisham. The fact that the trafficking charge against her was amended to one of possession does not, in my mind, point to a motive or incentive to falsely implicate Hisham. She had already been convicted and sentenced to a 12 month prison term. There was therefore nothing to stop her from exculpating Hisham. Having observed her demeanour in court, I find that she had given her evidence in a matter of fact manner and she did not make any attempt to minimise her involvement in the whole transaction nor exaggerate Hisham’s involvement. In fact a closer examination of her evidence would show that she had tried to minimise Hisham’s involvement by testifying that Hisham had lent the Subutex to Emran, and that there was no mention of price. She had also testified that Hisham had Subutex only for his own consumption, and that he had initially refused to give Emran the Subutex but he had reluctantly relented out of pity for Emran’s pregnant fiancee. This evidence is not consistent with someone bent on falsely implicating another. .       Therefore, I was satisfied that the prosecution has proven their case against both accused persons beyond reasonable doubt and I duly convict them on the respective charges in DAC 52645/06 and DAC 52656/06. .         Emran has now appealed against the conviction in respect of the trafficking charge (DAC 52656/06) and against the sentence in respect of the possession of utensils charge (DAC 205/07). .       I am also not satisfied that the harassment was so inordinate that Emran’s will to resist was sapped. Kechik had only called him at his residential telephone line 2 to 3 times a day for about a week. And based on his own evidence, it would be reasonable to infer that on some of the days during that particular week, he would have been at work and therefore uncontactable. This was because he was then working part-time as a lashing worker all the way until the date of his arrest. His work schedule comprised 2 to 3 work days a week averaging 15 to 20 hours each day. So on at least 2 to 3 days when Kechik was purportedly calling him up at his home, Emran would have been at work. Another pertinent point to note is that despite the harassment, Emran had been able to ignore Kechik’s entreaties until 22 Nov 06. There is no conceivable reason for Emran to have suddenly succumbed on 22 Nov 06. There is also another possible explanation for these telephone calls. Emran had testified that he had lied to Kechik by promising to look for a seller.

For this  and all the reasons as elaborated in the preceding paragraphs, I was therefore satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the accused and convicted him as charged. Upon his conviction, the prosecution informed me that the accused’s antecedents  started from 1967 till 1999. Besides Penal Code offences, he was convicted on the 13 of August, 1983 of   2  counts of possession of drugs and 1 count of trafficking.  I was told that the co-accused Thangam was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. I sentenced   the accused to a similar term of 5 years imprisonment. He was spared caning because of his age. At the end of the trial, the  accused was convicted .   There  were 3 other charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act against him, 1 for enhanced  possession of a class ‘C’ drug and 2 for consumption of a class  ‘A’ and a specified drug which were stood down pending his trial. The accused  pleaded guilty to these  3 charges. I sentenced him to a term of 5 years’ imprisonment for the charge (the mandatory minimum) which he was convicted of after the trial, 2 years’ imprisonment for the possession charge (the mandatory minimum) and 1 year imprisonment for each of the consumption charge. The 5 year term and the terms for the consumption charges were ordered to run consecutively, making it a total of  7 years’  imprisonment. The accused is now appealing against  his conviction  on the charge to which he claimed trial. The accused, being dissatisfied, is now appealing only against his conviction. He is now serving his sentence. Thangam, a Malaysian national, had pleaded guilty to 1 count of importation of  the cannabis,  referred to in the charge and was currently serving his sentence. He admitted that he had been consuming cannabis  on and off for more than 20 years since the 1980’s.  He would normally get his supply of cannabis from Johor, Malaysia  where he stays and paid  150 Malaysian ringgit for 25 gram.  Prior to his arrest on the 6th of March 2008,  Thangam said that he  would enter Singapore  to do odd jobs.\n",

      " .       The evidence adduced by the Defence was by way of the oral evidence of Noraini, the accused and Noraini’s foster brother, Azman.  Having considered their evidence, the court made certain observations.  They are these:\n",
      "(1)        In her evidence, Noraini claimed that the accused was unaware that she was trafficking drugs.  This was despite the fact that the accused aware that she was purchasing drugs and were actually consuming heroin together.  According to Noraini, the accused was not even aware the source from which she obtain her supply of drugs.  He did not know she was repacking the packets of drugs she bought and repacking them.  The accused did not even know that she kept drugs in their children’s bedroom.  In relation to the trafficking charge, Noraini also asserted that the accused was not aware of the drug transaction between her and Massuri.  It would seem that the only involvement the accused had was to consume the drugs bought by Noraini and nothing else.  Noraini’s evidence in court was in sharp contrast to the two statements she made in the form of PS1 and PS2.  In her statements, she had painted a picture of the deep involvement on the accused’s part in the sale of drugs to Massuri.  Far from being ignorant of the sale transaction between Noraini and Massuri, the accused was in the thick of things.  The accused, the owner of the drugs sold to Massuri had handed the 3 straws to Noraini to be sold.  The accused was also the person who had repacked the packets of drugs he had bought into straws for sale. Noraini was merely helping the accused to sell the heroin.  When Noraini was questioned on the difference between her evidence in court and the statements she made in PS1 and PS2 revealing her husband’s role in trafficking of the drugs, she explained that she was scared and had made up the statements to implicate her husband and push all the blame to him.  In other words, if Noraini was to be believed, then she was trying in PS1 and PS2 to push all the blame for the trafficking onto the shoulders of the accused so as to exonerate herself.  Noraini was therefore asked to point out the parts of the statements which exonerated her.  She was evasive in her answer but in the end she agreed that there was nothing in the statements which exculpated her.  She also stated that while she tried to push the blame to the accused, she had implicated herself.  That being the case, her claim that she had fabricated the statements to exonerate herself appears to be weak;\n",
      "(2)        Noraini stated that she had pushed the blame for the selling of drugs to Massuri onto the accused because he took pity on her.  She explained this by saying this:\n",
      "If Noraini was acting on her husband’s instruction that she was to push all the blame to him and she attempted to do as instructed by the accused, she would have pushed all the responsibility to the accused.  Clearly she did not do so.  Therefore Noraini’s claim that she had fabricated the statements to push the blame to the accused is untenable.  Furthermore, it must be noted that the accused stated in court that he did not know Noraini sold drugs.  Thus, when he came to know that Noraini had sold drugs to Massuri, he was in shock as he did not expect her to sell drugs.  If the accused had known Noraini’s drug trafficking background as stated by Noraini, there would be no reason for the news and realisation that she had sold drugs to Massuri to come to him as a shock or surprise;\n",
      "(3)        Noraini had alleged that the accused had asked her to push all the blame to him as he took pity on her and that he had done so as he was aware of her background in trafficking drugs.  Thus, it would therefore appear from Noraini’s that it was the accused who had on his own volition initiated the plan for her to push all the blame to him.  However, in his examination-in-chief, the accused stated that he did not know Noraini had sold drugs to Massuri as he was asleep.  He went on to explain the reason why he had admitted to be involved in trafficking in his statement.  He declared, “As a husband, I had to bear the responsibility of whatever had happened.”  While that was what he declared was his intention, a perusal of the accused’s statement (PS3) will reveal that the accused clearly did not carry out his alleged intention to exonerate his wife.  In fact the accused himself conceded that maybe there was nothing in his statement which exonerated his wife.  Far from exonerating his wife, he had asserted that when Noraini informed him that Massuri was going to their flat to buy heroin, he had given 3 straws to Noraini who subsequently sold them to Massuri.  The accused had in fact incriminated his wife by saying she was the one who sold the drugs to Massuri.  Thus, if he had felt compelled by his sense of spousal duty to voluntarily shoulder the responsibility for the drug trafficking and had given the instruction to Noraini as alleged, then he would surely have admitted to the drug trafficking in an attempt to clear Noraini’s name rather than doing the reverse.  On top of that, if he had wanted to exonerate his wife at all, he would not claimed in court that he was not involved at all and push all the blame for the trafficking onto her shoulders instead.  What had happened to his sense of chivalry and duty as a husband to bail his wife out of big trouble she had got herself into with the law?  What became of the pity he had for his wife Noraini as alleged by her?  It seems that all his alleged gallantry as a dutiful husband had deserted him and vanished into thin air overnight to be substituted by a strong desire for self-preservation even it meant incriminating his wife in drug trafficking in the process.  Viewed from this perspective, the accused’s assertion and for that matter that of Noraini as well that their statements concerning their respective involvement in drug trafficking was a fabrication could not be taken seriously as it lacked credibility.\n",
      "(4)        Noraini’s evidence in court was that she had bought drugs, repacked them into straws and sold some of them while keeping some straws of heroin to be consumed by her and the husband.  The accused testified that he was unaware that Noraini was trafficking in drugs.  He claimed that when he learned that she had sold drugs to Massuri, he was shocked as he did not expect her to sell drugs.   The accused’s claim of ignorance of Noraini’s drug trafficking activities and in particular the transaction with Massuri was highly inconceivable for various reasons.  Firstly, it must be remembered that the accused had admitted that he was aware of Noraini buying drugs.  He claimed Noraini usually purchased in the form of straws.  This contradicted Noraini’s evidence that she bought the heroin in packets.  Secondly, he had together with his wife consumed drugs heroin purchased by her with her money.  Yet, he did not know the source of her supply.  He did not even know that she kept the drugs in their children’s room.  In short, he knew very little about Noraini’s activities in drugs. It would appear that as Noraini’s husband, he had taken little interest concerning her drug activities.  All that he was interested in appeared to be just consuming the drugs procured by her for free.  This is hard to believe bearing in mind that at least at a certain point of time, the accused had felt duty-bound as a husband to take responsibility for the crime of drug trafficking committed by Noraini.  Thirdly, he was living with Noraini in the same apartment as husband and wife and as such would reasonably be expected to be aware of his wife’s drug activities especially those carried out in the apartment such as the repacking of drugs.  Fourthly, he was according to Noraini aware of her drug trafficking background.  Therefore the accused’s stand that he was totally unaware of the transaction between Noraini and Massuri was, in my view, unimpressive and of no weight.\n",
      "(5)        In his evidence, Azman who was called by the accused as a witness claimed that he had never met the accused before and did not know he was Noraini’s husband.  It must be noted that Azman was in remand pending his trial of trafficking in a controlled drug which was related to the case of the accused and Noraini.  In PS3, the accused alleged that he had purchased 3 packets of heroin from Azman on 12 February 2008.  He had repacked the drugs into straws.  The accused added that the 3 straws sold to Massuri were the remnant straws from the drug purchase made from Azman on 12 February 2008.  The accused’s statement had clearly incriminated Azman.  Therefore, it is obvious that Azman had a great and personal interest in the outcome of the trial of the accused and his wife in which he was called by the accused as a witness.  In the circumstances, I was satisfied that Azman could not be considered to be a truthful and reliable witness. .         The Prosecution applied for the trial of the accused and Noraini in respect of the joint trafficking charge be held jointly.  The accused and Noraini had no objection to this application and it was granted by the court.  At the end of the trial, both the accused and Noraini were convicted of the respective charge of joint trafficking.  The accused has now appealed against his conviction only. There is no appeal lodged by Noraini either against her conviction or sentence. .       In the light of the above, the Court held that the accused was not a witness of truth and rejected his claim that ‘D’ was not given by him voluntarily.  The Court held the Prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that ‘D’ was given voluntarily by the accused.  It accordingly ordered ‘D’ to be admitted and marked as PS3. .       The oral evidence adduced by the Prosecution was, apart from Massuri, from police officers and the medical officers from CMC.  Upon scrutinising their evidence, I found there were no major inconsistencies or contradiction of any kind to suggest that they were less than truthful witnesses.  I was satisfied that they were witnesses of truth on whose testimony the Court could rely on.  As for the evidence of Massuri who was serving sentence for selling the drugs which she had obtained from Noraini to W/ASP Lui, her evidence was not challenged by the defence.  The court noted that Massuri had stated that when she was outside the gate of the apartment buying the heroin from Noraini, she did not see anybody else besides Noraini.  The fact that Massuri did not see anybody else besides Noraini does not necessarily mean that the accused was not actually standing behind Noraini at that time if one were to consider the surrounding circumstances of that visit by Massuri to the apartment.  Massuri did not enter the apartment.  She was met by Noraini at the gate.  Therefore Massuri may not have a full view of what or who was behind Noraini.  Moreover, the purpose of Massuri going to the apartment was not a social visit.  She was there to buy heroin and therefore her mind would be focussed on that.  Furthermore, Massuri was there to make an illegal transaction with Noraini which was done quickly.  Whether Noraini’a husband was standing behind her would not have be of particular concern or interest to Massuri.  In any case, the evidence of SI Nedumaran (PW3) who was observing the transaction at Blk 404 between Massuri and Noraini from the top floor of Blk 403 was clear.  SI Nedumaran had seen a Malay man behind Noraini when Massuri went to the apartment.  There is no evidence of any male Malay in the apartment at that time other than the accused.  Therefore it could be inferred that the accused was the one SI Nedumaran saw standing behind Noraini.  This was corroborated by Noraini’s evidence in PS1 that the accused was there when Massuri met her at the gate.\n",

      " Taken as a whole, the evidence and the circumstances pointed conclusively to the fact that the accused had participated in the transaction whereby  Shamad sold a packet of cannabis to Norizan for $60.  She knew full well that what she gave to Shamad was a packet of cannabis which he wanted to pass to Norizan for the purpose of selling to her. The accused had therefore committed the offence of jointly trafficking with Shamad as indicated in the charge preferred against her. I therefore held that the prosecution had successfully discharged its burden of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted the accused  on the charge. In determining the admissibility of the statements given by the accused , I was mindful that the onus was on the prosecution to prove that she had given them voluntarily.  I noted that the accused’s allegation that Insp Tang  told  her that she would get a minimal sentence if she said whatever she knew and  because of this she signed the first statement was never raised to Insp Tang when he was cross-examined.  In total, this allegation, inclusive of the claim that he called  her stupid cannot amount to a threat, inducement or promise. I agree with the prosecution that they were just too vague. Further, not once during the recording of the second statement by SSgt  Michelle , did she inform the latter  that her first statement was inaccurate and she  had given  it involuntarily to Insp Tang.  After being charged and while out on bail, the accused had plenty of opportunities to complain about the way Insp Tang recorded her statement but she failed to do so, by her own admission. It therefore appeared to me that these allegations were afterthoughts which she fabricated during the course of her trial. The accused was tried jointly with her accomplice Abdul Shamad Bin Abd Kahar (‘Shamad’) who faced a similar charge of trafficking.  At the end of their trial, both were convicted on their respective trafficking charges.  The accused then pleaded guilty to 1 charge of possession of a Class “A” drug, namely tetrahydrocannabinol,  in DAC 24851/2008, which is an offence under section 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act. This charge  had been stood down pending the outcome of the trial. I sentenced her to a term of 5 years imprisonment on the trafficking charge and 1 year imprisonment on the possession charge. Both terms of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently. The accused is now appealing against her conviction and sentence. As for her second statement the accused’s  only reason for having given it  is because she was tired but she did  not convey this fact to SSgt Michelle. These points about being tired, not allowed to make a phone call or to use the bathroom were never put to SSgt Michelle during cross- examination. The recording of the second statement took only 1 hour and 20 minutes. By no stretch of the imagination can her allegations, even if they were true,  be considered as a threat, inducement, promise or even oppression which ought to have rendered  her statement as involuntarily given.  Likewise, she did not make any complaint about the recording of this second statement prior to the trial although  she was  on bail after she was charged in court. While giving her examination-in-chief she disputed only paragraphs 11,12 and 14 but when she was cross-examined she added in paragraph 10 even though she had ample time to read  the statement before she took the stand.  I could hardly regard her evidence as reliable with her afterthoughts and contradictions. Her allegations therefore were purely self-serving and nothing more than an attempt to exculpate herself.\n",

      " .           For the reasons stated above, I found that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted the accused of the charge. .           Next, I looked at the background to Kasman coming to give evidence in court. Kasman had already pleaded guilty and was sentenced to corrective training and caning on a number of charges, including a charge of being in possession of the 8.8 grams of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. In the statement of facts the Kasman admitted to, it was stated that Noorazni had asked Azman (the accused) to hand a brown paper bag containing drugs to Kasman[note: 4]. As he had already been convicted and sentenced, there was no reason for him to give false evidence in order to downplay his role or in the hope of getting a lighter sentence. .           As for the defence submission, I noted that Noorazni would have been a relevant and material prosecution witness. After all, he was named in the charge. However, the prosecution has no obligation to call any particular witness and it is for the court to determine at the end of the day, whether the case has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt based on the evidence adduced. In the absence of an ulterior motive, there is no reason to draw adverse inferences against the prosecution for its failure to call witnesses: Ang Jwee Herng v PP [2001] 2 SLR 474 at [42]. The prosecution did not “hide” the witness from the defence and Noorazni could have been interviewed in prison and called as a witness. .           I found that Kasman was a credible witness who did not falsely implicate the accused. His evidence was internally consistent and there was no reason to doubt that he could recall who passed him the drugs. Kasman had already been convicted and sentenced for his offences. Therefore, framing the accused would not result in more lenient treatment for him, nor would it have helped his friend Noorazni who had been convicted on a capital charge. As such, I found his evidence to be “unusually convincing.”\n",

Salleh bin Kahar was re-arrested in March 2009, pleaded guilty to possession and was convicted and sentenced.  On 20 March 2009, the present charge of trafficking was framed against the accused. In mitigation, counsel for the accused cited the fact that this was the accused’s first trafficking offence.  Further, it was pointed out that if Salleh had not absconded, the accused would have been tried and convicted of both consumption and trafficking and would have had the benefit of having his sentences run concurrently or, at the very least, a substantial overlap between the sentences.  But because Salleh absconded, the accused has already served nearly 2 years of his sentence for consumption and now faces the prospect of serving a much longer period of imprisonment than he would otherwise have if Salleh bin Kahar had not absconded.  Counsel thus asked that the mandatory minimum be imposed and that sentence be backdated to 20 March 2009 when the charge was first brought. After the trial, I convicted the accused and sentenced him to the mandatory minimum of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes.\n",

      " On the evidence, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was in possession of the heroin found in his room, and that he had them for the purposes of trafficking. The Prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused and I therefore found him guilty as charged, and convicted him accordingly, and sentenced him to suffer death. Mr Seah submitted that there was a break in the chain of possession of the seized drugs and therefore, the weight of the drugs in question cannot be accepted as having been proved beyond reasonable doubt. There was a period of about two days between the time the seized drugs were photographed and weighed in the presence of the accused and the time they were sealed by Insp Chee. I agree that it is extremely important that the chain of possession is properly accounted for and that there should not be a single unaccounted moment if it meant that the drugs adduced at trial were not the drugs seized from the accused. I agree with counsel that the procedure of accountability is extremely important. On the facts before me, I was of the view, having regard to the weight and evidence of the Health Sciences Authority officers, that the argument by Mr Seah that there could have been a contamination of the seized drugs was speculative, and not, on the facts, sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in my mind. Weighing and sealing the drugs in the presence of the accused is naturally the more desirable practice, but in this case, I was satisfied that the Prosecution’s case was not affected. I think that it was not a matter of law, but a question of fact, that a breach of this procedure should result in giving the benefit of doubt to the accused as a matter of course as counsel submitted. The Prosecution adduced various statements made by the accused including his statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code, (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) containing confessions to possession of diamorphine and also to acts of trafficking. These statements, save for one point, were not challenged by the accused and were admitted into evidence. The evidence adduced was sufficiently incriminating against the accused and his defence was therefore called in rebuttal. The accused elected to testify. His testimony was consistent with the statements he made to the investigating officer, Inspector Chee Tuck Seng (“Insp Chee”). The main dispute regarding the statements recorded by Insp Chee concerned the word “heroin”. The accused testified that he did not use the word heroin and that he told Insp Chee that the drug he was trafficking was “peh hoon”. Unfortunately, the statements were recorded through an interpreter in Mandarin, Mr Wu Nan Yong, who died before the trial commenced. He conceded, however, that he knew that “peh hoon” was a reference to drugs. He did not elaborate whether he meant prohibited drugs under the Act. Although drug trafficking paraphernalia (such as plastic sachets, a plastic sealer, and a small weighing scale) were also found in his room, there was no evidence that the accused was himself a drug user. Although the evidence of Mr Wu Nan Yong would have been helpful, I was satisfied that the accused knew that “peh hoon” was heroin. Insp Chee testified that he questioned the accused who, in response, used “peh hoon” and heroin interchangeably. I did not rely upon this part of Insp Chee’s opinion as crucial, but it was important as part of all the factors upon which I formed the view that I could not accept the accused’s testimony that he did not know that the drugs in question were heroin. On his own evidence, he said that he was told by Din (one of his customers) that the drugs were heroin. The many lengthy statements were read back to the accused each time the recording ended. The narrative did not indicate a point in which the accused might have been unclear what the substance described as “heroin” was. I was satisfied that the accused knew that he had been arrested for a serious drug trafficking offence and there were no indications of any concern by him that the offences were capital offences. I was of the view that the statements were properly and accurately translated as to reflect “peh hoon” as heroin, and that there was no uncertainty on the part of the accused as to what kind of drug it was that he was being charged for trafficking. I did not accept his evidence that he did not know that “peh hoon” was heroin. The accused was a 25-year-old who was arrested when he went to deliver heroin to a customer at Block 230, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. The charge against him in respect of the heroin seized from him there (the second charge) was stood down as it was not a capital charge. The quantity there was stated to be “not less than 7.62g”. This was relied upon by Mr Rupert Seah (“Mr Seah”), counsel for the accused, in his defence of the accused in respect of the first charge, which was the capital charge upon which the accused was tried before me. The first charge arose from the heroin found in the room of a flat at Block 745, Yishun Street 72 (“the Flat”). This was the flat belonging to the parents of the accused. The room in question was occupied by the accused and his 17-year-old brother. The younger brother was not involved in the proceedings before me. The heroin found in the Flat amounted to 50.05g. They were found in three different places in the room of the accused. A lot was found in a cupboard next to the bed, one was found in the bottom drawer of his closet, and one in a red paper bag on the floor near the windows. These facts were not disputed by the accused. The charge against him was for possession of the 50.05g of diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking. The Second Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) provided the punishment for an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2). The penalty on conviction where the drug was diamorphine and the quantity was more than 15g, is death.\n",

      " Based on the 2 statements of the accused, he has positively admitted that the methamphetamine found in his possession was for the purposes of trafficking as they were meant for sale. I therefore found that the prosecution had proven its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted the accused accordingly on the charge. At the end of the trial, the accused was convicted on the charge. I sentenced him to serve the mandatory minimum term of 5 years imprisonment with 5 strokes of the cane. As the accused, at the time of his conviction, was serving a term of 6 years imprisonment for enhanced possession and consumption charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act with effect from the 4th of June, 2009, which was pronounced on the 29th of October, 2009, I ordered his sentence to take effect from the expiry of his current sentence. This was a case where section 234 of the Criminal Procedure Code was applicable as it provided that where a person was undergoing imprisonment the latter term of imprisonment shall commence either immediately or at the expiration of the current sentence. I decided on the latter option. If the sentence had been ordered to commence immediately it would have the effect of making the latest sentence run concurrently with his sentence of 6 years imprisonment. Given the fact that the accused already had a previous conviction for trafficking in a controlled drug in 2004, the result would have been too lenient. Although all the 8 charges, inclusive of the 7 he had pleaded guilty to, preferred against the accused arose from an arrest on the 3rd of June, 2009, he had in reality committed distinct and separate offences of possession, consumption and trafficking. This was an aggravating factor which I considered. Upon his conviction, the prosecution informed the court that the accused had a criminal history which began in 1998. This was for an offence of gaming under the Common Gaming Houses Act which was followed in 2002 with offences for possessing and distributing obscene films and in 2003 for buying an illegal lottery ticket. His drug related antecedents were for convictions on the 9th of March, 2004, under the Misuse of Drugs Act. On this date he was sentenced to a total of 3 years and 13 months imprisonment with 4 strokes of the cane for 1 count of trafficking in ketamine, 1 count of possession for ketamine, 1 count for consumption of norketamine with 2 counts of trafficking and I count of having utensils for drug taking taken into consideration.

      " For the reasons above, I am satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the first and second accused, Pausi and Roslan, and I therefore find them guilty as charged and convict them accordingly and sentence them to suffer death on the first charge. The sentences on the non-capital charges are stood down with liberty to apply. Pausi was a 25-year old Malaysian. He testified that he was asked by one “Bobby” to collect money from Roslan. He met Roslan on the day and in the manner described in the evidence, but he said that all he did was to collect the money from Roslan and he did not know that a drug transaction had taken place. I found his narrative too vague and brief to evince a convincing account of his involvement on the afternoon of 14 June 2008. The presence of Zamri, Norzainy, and Nuradaha could not be explained if all Pausi was asked to do was collect money from Roslan. Only three cars were involved that afternoon. Nuradaha testified that he took the Levi’s bag from Pausi’s car (the Perdana) on Roslan’s instructions. Although Mr Johan, counsel for Pausi, managed to get Nuradaha to say under cross-examination that he (Nuradaha) was “not sure”, but it was “probably” from Pausi’s car, I am of the view that the evidence as a whole indicated that it was from Pausi’s car. If it was from Norzainy’s Nissan, then there was no explanation for Pausi having to collect money from Roslan under such elaborate circumstances if his collection was unconnected with Nuradaha’s taking delivery of the diamorphine. I am of the view that his testimony created no reasonable doubt in my mind that he delivered the diamorphine to Nuradaha knowing or having reason to know that the Levi’s bag contained diamorphine. Roslan was arrested on 18 July 2008, weeks after the arrests of the others because he left his mother’s flat to stay at his step-brother Shamsubari’s flat. The arrest was made after hours of stand-off when Roslan who locked himself in one of the bedrooms refused to open the door. He testified that he did not hear the CNB officers because he was asleep. Comparing the evidence I am unable to find Roslan’s version credible. He also said that he was roughly treated when the CNB officers entered the bedroom to arrest him. Some physical force might have been necessary given the circumstances and I accept that the arrest was made with reasonable but not excessive force. Roslan also denied that his cellphone number was in Nuradaha and Norzainy’s cellphones under the nickname “Celak” and its variant “Lan Celak”. The evidence of the former two accomplices in court satisfied me that Roslan was known as Celak and Lan Celak (and sometimes as “Celako”).\n",

The mandatory death sentence prescribed under s 33 read with the Second Schedule of the Act is pronounced accordingly. Mr Tiwary, for Lim, submitted that it was for the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Lim’s four long statements had been voluntarily made, and that it was therefore sufficient for Lim to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether or not there had been any inducement or promise. Mr Ng, for the Prosecution, while accepting that it had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the long statements had been made by Lim voluntarily, nonetheless contended that the court first had to find, as a fact, that there had been inducement, in order to conclude that a reasonable doubt had been raised as to the voluntariness of Lim’s statements. In other words, it was not enough, according to the Prosecution, for doubts to be entertained as to whether or not there had been inducement: inducement had to be found as a matter of fact, and this the accused bore the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities. Based on my observations of the behaviour and demeanour of Lim as well as ASP Richard Soh during their respective testimonies in the voir dire, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had discharged its burden in establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, the voluntariness of Lim’s long statements.

      " I also found that the accused’s change of position during the trial and his replies in court did not lend themselves to establishing an impression that he was a credible witness. He was often evasive in his answers and was often not forthright to even some very straightforward questions. In all, the prosecution has therefore proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had in his possession not less than 23.38 grams of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, thus committing an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. I therefore convict the accused and sentence him according to the law as stated in s 33 of the MDA. It was the prosecution’s case that unless otherwise rebutted, s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)(“MDA”) presumes that the 28 packets (containing 9.92 grams of diamorphine) together with the 3 bundles of heroin (containing 13.46 grams of diamorphine) found in the room 188 apartment were in the possession of the accused for the purpose of trafficking. The defence tried to rebut the presumption by claiming that the 3 bundles of heroin were for his own consumption, thereby bringing the quantity of drugs for trafficking below the 15 g threshold. Essentially, the accused’s defence was that the accused was only trafficking in the 28 packets containing 9.92 grams of diamorphine and the prosecution should not have included the 3 bundles of heroin containing 13.46 grams of diamorphine into the amount trafficked by the accused as these were for his own consumption. The prosecution argued that the presumption was not rebutted for two main reasons. First, the prosecution relied on the accused’s statements to prove that the accused had always intended to sell the heroin in his possession i.e. both the 28 packets and the 3 bundles of heroin. Second, the prosecution also argued that it was not believable that the accused would set aside or purchase such a large quantity of drugs (i.e. containing 13.46 grams of diamorphine) for his consumption. Not only did the accused not have the financial means of doing so, but his account of self-consumption was also unbelievable. The case for the defence was also a straightforward one. As I have already alluded to earlier, the defence’s case was that the 3 bundles of heroin (marked A4A, A4B and A4C) were meant for self-consumption i.e. the accused was only guilty of trafficking 9.92 grams of diamorphine, and hence, the mandatory death penalty for trafficking in amounts above 15 grams was inapplicable. I will now set out in extenso the material arguments for the defence of consumption.\n",
      "(a)     The 3 bundles of heroin were not packed for sale in smaller packets and the fact that the bundles were “opened and restored in a rough and ready” paper and black tape manner suggested that the bundles were not meant for trafficking. It was the “modus operandi” of the accused to “reduce the bundles into sachets whenever he received them from Ah Man”.\n",
      "(b)     Unlike previous consignments, where the accused would pass a certain quantity of heroin back to ‘Ah Man’ for the latter’s use, there was no such agreement for the 6th consignment. This “lack of a record of any agreement” reflected that the 6th consignment was made in a “cavalier” fashion “for the simple reason that [the accused] had not intended to traffic the 3 bundles...but rather [had intended] to consume it”.\n",
      "(c)     Neither the accused nor ‘Ah Man’ was aware of the actual weight of the heroin in the three bundles. This suggested that the drugs were indeed intended for self-consumption. Further, the police did not find any empty packets in the room 188 apartment and the absence of packing materials further supported the defence of consumption.\n",
      "(d)     There were packets of heroin found on the white tray of the dressing table in the room 188 apartment. Since the accused had quantities of heroin left unsold, there was therefore no need for the accused to purchase additionally the 3 bundles of heroin for the purpose of trafficking. The fact that the accused only went to see Tan on 12 August 2008 for the purpose of obtaining ‘Ice’ was further reflective of the accused’s intention to stop trafficking in heroin.\n",
      "(e)     The accused was also a heavy addict and took 4 g of heroin a day and he would suffer from withdrawal symptoms whenever he did not consume heroin. It was therefore believable that the 3 bundles of heroin were purchased for the sole purpose of consumption.\n",
      "(f)     There were consumption utensils, which were not recovered by the CNB officers from the room 188 apartment during their search and seizure of the flat. Had the consumption utensils been recovered, they would have provided credible support to the accused’s claim that he was a heavy addict and that the 3 bundles were intended for his own consumption.\n",
      "(g)     As for the prosecution’s case that the accused was in financial distress and had therefore no means to afford the 3 bundles of heroin, this was equally characteristic of a “haphazard [drug] user” who would accept delivery of the drugs without “considering the financial implication[s]”. In any case, the prosecution did not take into account any revenue that was made by the accused in selling ‘Ice’, which could have otherwise financed the accused’s own consumption. Further, the accused had more than $6,500 in his possession and was therefore not in real financial desperation. Whether it is reasonable for an accused person to omit his defence would therefore ultimately depend on the facts of the case. In Lim Lye Huat Benny, the Court of Appeal placed little weight on the accused’s omission to mention his defence in his s 122(6) statement because the s 122(6) statement was recorded “at the unearthly time between 4.25 am and 4.55 am and the [accused had] said that at that time he was too tired and hungry to think of his defence” (at [24]; emphasis added). In this case, while the s 122 (6) statement was recorded at 5.06 am on 13 August 2008, there were otherwise no recorded complaints made by the accused along the lines that he was unwell or that he was suffering from any withdrawal symptoms which might affect his ability to mention his defence.\n",

Both checked and could not find the articles they were meant to carry and yet neither raised the alarm with their principals. Either they lied about checking the suitcase or they did not check because already knew what it was they were carrying, namely heroin. The evidence against them were incontrovertible insofar as the heroin as described in the charge was found hidden in the black suitcase that the second accused handed to the first accused. The only issue was whether I found any evidence that would create the doubt as to whether one or both accused did not know that the suitcase contained heroin. The evidence created no reasonable doubt in my mind that the prosecution’s case had been proved. I therefore find both accused persons guilty and sentence them to suffer death. The second accused testified that he was asked by one “Lau de” to help bring gold bars to Singapore. He was handed a bag, supposedly to contain the gold, in a hotel in Myanmar. He checked the bag but did not see any gold and he assumed that the gold must be hidden in the suitcase somewhere. He did not report to “Lau de” that he did not see any gold. I did not find his testimony convincing and I was of the view that his evidence did not create any reasonable doubt in my mind that he might not have known that he was carrying heroin. It was immaterial that the CNB did not make adequate efforts to trace “Lau De” or check on his cell-phones.

      " The Judge, in a brief judgment of five paragraphs, explained why he found the Appellant guilty of the charge and upon convicting him, sentenced him to suffer the mandatory death penalty. To facilitate the understanding of our grounds, we think it will be helpful to set out the Judgment in full: But the tolerance for “impressionistic” type of reasoning must be constrained by the court’s wariness of arbitrariness, and it is also limited by the desire for open justice. Hence, the law ordinarily requires the trial judge to explain his assessment of the witness’s testimony. Examples include where oral evidence is accepted even though it is contradicted by contemporaneous writing by the witness (R v MacPherson [1982] 1 NZLR 650 at 652) and generally, where only part of a witness’s evidence is accepted (Crowley v Willis (1992) 110 FLR 194 at 200). We agree with Kirby P in Soulemezis ([19] supra) at 259 that: “Where nothing exists but an assertion of satisfaction on undifferentiated evidence the judicial obligation has not been discharged. Justice has not been done and it has not been seen to be done” [emphasis added]. We should also add that the formulaic reliance on demeanour, without more, to justify a finding of credibility is today often questionable. Not infrequently, this is no more than subjectivity piled upon subjectivity. The courts are full of witnesses whose memory, as time passes, becomes more and more certain and less and less accurate: see J P O Barry, “The Methodology of Judging” (1994) James Cook U L Rev 135 at 142. Objective reasoning is therefore always preferred and it will be a rare case that is truly bereft of any objective evidence and turns entirely on the evidence of a single witness’s recollection. Regretfully, we do not think that the judicial duty to state reasons has been satisfied in the present case. In our view, the nature of the case here, which involved a capital charge, necessitated detailed reasons, especially in relation to the findings of fact made and application of the law to such findings of fact. It would enable the Appellant, members of the profession and the public to understand the reasons for the decision. In addition, detailed reasons were necessary to enable this court to understand the grounds for the Judge’s decision and to appraise its correctness. There were no other countervailing policy grounds that would militate against the duty to provide detailed reasons here. With this in mind, we turn to consider the areas in which the reasons provided were insufficient. These proceedings, it bears emphasis, relate to a capital charge on which the Appellant was found guilty. The judicial duty to give full reasons is therefore even more compelling in such a matter. It is, of course, never a light matter to order a retrial. Much anxiety, inconvenience and even hardship is caused all round and sometimes the ultimate decision may not be different. However, given the lack of clarity in the Judgment and our inability as an appellate court to assess the credibility of the Appellant, we have no alternative but to direct that there shall be a retrial instead before another High Court Judge, who will have the opportunity to closely scrutinise afresh the Appellant’s credibility in the context of all the relevant evidence. We would also emphasise that nothing in this Judgment should be taken as affecting any substantive determination in the subsequent trial and appeal, if any. Finally, we are also constrained to observe that we received little assistance from the Appellant’s counsel in the present proceedings. Their submissions fell well short of the standard that we ordinarily expect from counsel in matters of this nature.\n",

      " At the close of the trial, I accepted the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses and in particular, the evidence of the CNB officers who kept observation. I also gave full weight to the statements of the Accused and Lim Soh Pheau. On the totality of the evidence, I found that on 20 May 2010, at about 3.40 pm, the Accused had sold one straw of heroin containing 0.05 gram of Diamorphine to Lim Soh Pheau at the 14th floor corridor of Blk 503 Bedok North Street 3. I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the charge. I sentenced him to 6 years imprisonment. At the end of the six day trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the charge. I sentenced the Accused to 6 years’ imprisonment. I shall now set out the basis of my decision. Once again I had difficulty accepting Lim Soh Pheau’s explanations. I failed to appreciate how reciting the handphone number out loud during the recording of the oral statements in a CNB vehicle would make it appear as if Lim Soh Pheau was the one who had provided the number if in fact he had not done so. Similarly, Lim Soh Pheau was unable to offer any reasonable explanation as to why the CNB officers would want him to implicate the Accused in the sale of the drugs. Lim Soh Pheau had the perfect opportunity to set the record straight when he pleaded guilty to the possession charge in court. He did not do so. All of these indicate to me that the statements which he made must contain the truth and his evidence in court is a vain attempt, in front of the Accused, to exculpate the Accused. I therefore disbelieved his testimony in court that he had purchased the straw of heroin from one Ah Seng. I found it implausible that the CNB officers did not try to establish the identity of the person who sold the drugs to him and would have been satisfied with an answer that a “friend” had sold the drugs to him. I was generally not persuaded by Lim Soh Pheau’s explanations as to why he made the statement which he did to Sergeant Shahreen Sofan. Interestingly, the only parts of his statement which he disputed were those portions which incriminated the Accused in the sale of the straw of heroin to himself. He had no issues with all the other parts of his statement including sentences which appeared in between the incriminating portions. Accordingly, I found that his credibility as a witness had been impeached and I allowed the Prosecution’s application under Section 147(3) of the Evidence Act, Chapter 97 to substitute his testimony in court with this statement.\n",

      " The totality of the evidence pointed to only one inevitable conclusion: that the defendant was in possession of the drugs in question, both in the purple paper bag (A1) in the bedroom and in the 7-Eleven plastic bag (SXQ1) in the living room, for the purposes of trafficking. The prosecution had proven its case against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, and the defendant was found guilty as charged and convicted accordingly on the four proceeded charges. The convictions were recorded on 15 March 2011. Sim Xin Qi, Dino (the “defendant”), was a 26-year-old male. He faced a total of 18 charges. All but two of the charges were drug-related. He claimed trial to four charges of possessing drugs for the purposes of trafficking, and was convicted after a trial. He subsequently pleaded guilty to two charges of drug possession, and consented to eleven other charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. On 31 March 2011, he was sentenced to a total of 16 years’ imprisonment and 22 strokes of the cane. No appeal was filed within the statutorily prescribed time for appeals. By way of Criminal Motion No. 38 of 2011, the defendant was granted an extension of time to file an appeal. The appeal against both the conviction and sentence was filed on 28 June 2011. Several aggravating factors were present in this case. There were a number of trafficking charges (four proceeded charges and one TIC) involving four different types of Class A controlled drugs (methamphetamine, ketamine, cannabis mixture, and cannabis). The quantity of drugs involved was not small. In particular, the 148.91g of methamphetamine (DAC 22388/2010) was close to the statutory threshold of 167g at which the minimum sentence would have been 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The defendant was also in possession of a fifth type of controlled drug (nimetazepam – a Class C controlled drug). There was a large number of TIC charges, and the nature and number of TIC charges aggravated the offences proceeded with: PP v UI [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 (CA) at [38] per Chan Sek Keong CJ. I agreed with the prosecution that the defendant could not be said to be a casual, small-time drug dealer. Another aggravating factor was the fact that the defendant was not a first offender. He had been convicted and sentenced for drug trafficking and other offences in 2001 for which he had been given a stiff sentence of six years and three months’ imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane. Yet he did not appear to have learned from this lesson. The prosecution submitted that the defendant’s possession of the drugs stated in the proceeded charges had been proved. Accordingly, as the drugs involved 56.8g of cannabis mixture (DAC 41824/2010), 148.91g of methamphetamine (DAC 22388/2010) and 153.5g of ketamine (DAC 41823/2010), the quantities were large enough to trigger the statutory presumption that the defendant had those drugs in possession for the purposes of trafficking. In respect of the 2.7g of cannabis (DAC 41825/2010), the presumption would not apply; but it was highlighted that the 2.7g of cannabis was found in the packet of drugs A1A2 which also contained the 29.11g of cannabis mixture to which the presumption of trafficking applied (and thus it was intended for the same purpose).\n",

      " Having considered the totality of the evidence, I found that the charge had been proven by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused person, Mr Misnawi Bin Paifi (the “defendant”), was 45 years’ old when the present criminal charges were brought against him. He faced a total of five charges. He claimed trial to one charge, which was a charge of possession of a controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking, an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the “MDA”). The other four charges were stood down pending the trial on the first charge. He was found guilty and convicted on the proceeded charge on 4 August 2011. The matter was then adjourned for the necessary papers to be prepared by the prosecution for the remaining charges to be dealt with. On 12 August 2011 the defendant filed an appeal against the conviction. On 15 August 2011 he pleaded guilty to three other charges, with another charge taken into consideration by consent for the purpose of sentencing. He was sentenced to a total of 22 years’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane. He filed an appeal against that sentence on 18 August 2011. The present grounds of decision relate to the defendant’s appeals against both the conviction and the sentence. Razali had pleaded guilty to and was convicted of the trafficking offence (as well as other offences) on 18 March 2011. The notes of evidence, charges, and statement of facts relating to Razali’s case were tendered in evidence by the prosecution (exhibit P18). It had been proven that the defendant had possession of the drug packet (F1C1A1A) found in the Car. On the day in question (20 August 2010), he was driving the Car (SFQ 4820M). At the time in question stated on the charge (7.45 pm), although the defendant had handed the keys to the Car to Razali earlier, he was still in possession of the drug (together with Razali) because he knew exactly where the Car was parked and where the drug could be found (at carpark lot number 75 near Block 177 of Toa Payoh Central) —and Razali had the key. I disbelieved the defendant’s claim that he was merely a driver for Razali. From the written statements of Razali, it was clear that the defendant and Razali had a common intention in collecting the drug that morning and subsequently selling the drug (or at least a portion of it). Both the defendant and Razali, acting in furtherance of their common intention, were thus jointly in possession of the drug for the purpose of trafficking. The drug was analysed by the HSA and found to contain 12.94 g of diamorphine.\n",

      " Just to be clear, I am not at all suggesting that the presumption can be rebutted simply by the accused claiming that he was ignorant of the precise nature of the controlled drugs. Instead, I am referring to a specific situation where it has been established either by way of the evidence or the Prosecution’s case that the accused in fact truly did not know the specific nature of the drugs because he truly believed that it contained drugs of a different nature than that stated in the charge. Further, I should add, for the avoidance of any doubt, that if the Prosecution seeks to prove actual knowledge via the doctrine of wilful blindness without relying on the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA, the Prosecution must prove it beyond any reasonable doubt. I accepted Ms Sofia’s evidence that she did not make the alleged inducement to Mas Swan for the following reasons:\n",
      "(a)     First, there was no conceivable reason for Ms Sofia, who was merely acting as an interpreter, to offer any inducement to Mas Swan of her own volition. I rejected Mr Kanagavijayan’s suggestion that Ms Sofia had made the alleged inducement in order to make her task easier by getting Mas Swan to admit to the Charge.[note: 28] In my judgment, there was simply no factual or logical basis for Ms Sofia, who was an interpreter of considerable experience (a total of 14 years when P32 was recorded),[note: 29] to believe that her task would be made easier once Mas Swan admitted to the Charge. In fact, what happened was that after P32 was recorded, she was subsequently involved in the recording of six other statements from Mas Swan. Clearly, her task was not made any easier by Mas Swan’s “confession” in P32.\n",
      "(b)     Second, Mas Swan’s conduct was entirely inconsistent with his own case. Although Mas Swan claimed that he became fearful after being told of the death penalty, incredulously, he admitted that he did not ask for further details regarding the reduction of his sentence or seek independent assurance from ASP Gary Chan, whom Mas Swan knew full well was the investigator in charge of the interview.[note: 30] Although the Prosecution relied on the doctrine of wilful blindness in attempting to prove the Charge against Mas Swan and/or to demonstrate that the presumption had not been successfully rebutted by him, it was, however, not the Prosecution’s case that Mas Swan’s suspicions were in fact aroused. The Prosecution submitted that wilful blindness was made out in Mas Swan’s case on the basis that his suspicions that the bundles contained heroin ought to have been aroused, and any reasonable person with his characteristics would not have believed Roshamima’s claims that the bundles contained “ecstasy” pills,[note: 105]ie, the test of wilful blindness, as the Prosecution understood it, was a subjective-objective test. During closing submissions, Prosecution submitted that given the manner in which the bundles were concealed behind the door panel of JHA 7781 and the covert nature of the delivery in Singapore, Mas Swan ought to have suspected that the bundles contained diamorphine. In this connection, it is pertinent to highlight that Roshamima did not lead any positive evidence to prove that she was not aware of the true nature of the controlled drugs. This must be so since she chose to defend the Charge at the threshold level that she had no knowledge of the existence of the bundles that were concealed in the door panel of JHA 7781 and was accordingly not in legal possession of the controlled drugs. It therefore follows that if the Prosecution was able to prove that Roshamima was aware that bundles containing controlled drugs were concealed in the car door panel, the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA would operate against her, and because she has not adduced any evidence to rebut that presumption, the Charge against her would, without more, indubitably be made out. This logical sequence and its inevitable outcome were eventually conceded by Mr Muzammil during oral submissions,[note: 107] though I would like to add that I am relying on what I understand to be the legal position, and not on his concession, in making such a finding.\n",

      " For all the reasons stated above, I therefore found that the accused was guilty of the offence charged. Accordingly, the accused was convicted and sentenced to death as mandated by s 33 of the MDA read together with the Second Schedule to the MDA. My reasons are as follows. The version of facts that the Defence had put forth in support of the accused’s defence of duress were inextricably the same alleged facts relied upon to show that the accused lacked knowledge of the actual contents found in the Bundle. The accused alleged that he was forced by King to deliver the Bundle containing “company spares” or “company product” (not heroin) to King’s brother in Singapore as he feared for Shalini’s life. For reasons already given, I did not accept the accused’s version of facts to be true, in particular the alleged fact that King had assaulted the accused and threatened to kill Shalini if the accused refused to (a) let King strap onto his left thigh the Bundle, which King told him contained “company spares” or “company product” and (b) deliver the strapped Bundle to King’s “brother” in Singapore. On this basis alone, the Defence was therefore left with no other credible evidence upon which to discharge the burden of proof placed on the accused to rebut the presumption imposed by s 18(2) of the MDA, ie, that the accused knew that the Bundle found in his possession in fact contained heroin. Having set out the principles governing the defence of duress, I now turn first to the evidence relied upon by the Defence in support of the defence of duress. Having heard the evidence, I found it difficult to accept that the defence of duress was evidentially substantiated on a balance of probabilities. I was not sufficiently satisfied on the evidence that the accused had successfully discharged his burden in proving that the character named “King” did in fact coerce the accused into delivering the Bundle by threatening to “finish” and “kill” Shalini. Indeed, I would have been more prepared to accept the truth of the existence of King’s threat had there been some cogent evidence adduced to show any harassment or physical harm being visited upon Shalini after the accused failed to deliver the Bundle because of the accused’s arrest. In fact, it was brought to my attention by the parties at trial that nothing untoward seemed to have happened to Shalini after the accused’s attempt to deliver the Bundle to King’s “brother” failed. This, while admittedly not in itself conclusive, nevertheless would still go some way in demonstrating that the entire episode of King’s threat could have been a fabrication or afterthought by the accused after all. More importantly, when the accused was first asked by the CNB officers why he had to deliver the Bundle to Woodlands, there was no mention at all by the accused of any threat made by King on Shalini’s life. In his long statement recorded by Sergeant Vasanthakumar, the accused merely stated in response to the question asked of him: During cross-examination, the accused sought to explain that he had omitted to mention King’s threat to Sergeant Vasanthakumar because he was “frightened” and not in the “right state of mind”, and he “could not think”. I did not believe the accused, given that the accused did in fact provide an explanation in his statement to Sergeant Vasanthakumar in the end as to why he delivered the Bundle, albeit one that was of no help whatsoever to his defence as compared to his subsequent explanation that he was delivering the Bundle under King’s threat. That such a paramount explanation of duress was not provided at all when the accused was first questioned by Sergeant Vasanthakumar rendered the accused’s story of King’s threat unbelievable given that (a) the threat directly concerned Shalini with whom the accused claimed he was deeply in love; (b) the accused had through his own evidence accepted that he was at all times aware of the dire legal consequences one could potentially face if one was charged and convicted for bringing illicit drugs into Singapore; (c) King’s threat, if true would have gone some way to exonerate the accused and it was not something that the accused would readily forget or omit to mention even under stressful conditions as a result of being arrested; and (d) an accused person would generally be far more likely, upon being questioned soon after his arrest, to mention facts to establish his innocence or to establish some form of defence (such as duress) to the possible offences that he might be faced with. I found it highly improbable that the accused who claimed to have been mistreated, assaulted and wrongly accused by CNB officers (see [12] above) despite his own belief as to his innocence would fail to explain himself more fully in his statement to Sergeant Vasanthakumar. Indeed, one would have thought that a person who genuinely believed himself to be wronged by the authorities would all the more have protested his innocence with the greatest of resolve and rigour possible. Yet, that did not happen in this case.\n",

      " I proceeded to examine the evidence against Quek on the altered charge and upon evaluating all the evidence in the trial and submissions of counsel, I found that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt his guilt in relation to the altered charge, convicted him and sentenced him to death, which is the mandatory punishment under the charge. Quek elected to remain silent upon his defence being called and did not call any witness to give evidence on his behalf. Evidence of possession and knowledge by prosecution witnesses and Somchit were not disputed by Quek’s counsel in cross-examination. From the evidence of the events from the time of Quek’s arrest to the search in the Bedok Condominium, I found that there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Quek had possession and knowledge. Counsel for Quek submitted that there was no evidence before the court that showed that Quek had possession of the drugs the subject of the charge for the purpose of trafficking. Counsel argued that while there was evidence that Quek had sold drugs in earlier transactions, those drugs were not the subject of the charge. I did not agree with this submission for two reasons. Firstly, the presumption of trafficking in s 17 of the Act was available to the Prosecution as the amount in question, 62.14g of diamorphine, was more than the threshold of 2g under that provision. Secondly and more importantly, Quek had packed the drugs in question for the purpose of selling them. The drugs in question were his stocks in his continuing narcotic drug retailing operation. There was therefore ample basis for finding that Quek had intended to traffic the drugs the subject of the charge. The Prosecution submitted that Somchit had failed to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the Act. Firstly, the Prosecution submitted that the relevant authorities supported the first interpretation of Tan Kiam Peng v PP [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“Tan Kiam Peng”), ie, that the Prosecution need only to prove that the accused knew that he or she was in possession of a controlled drug (see below at [19]). Since Somchit admitted that she knew the seized drugs were illegal, on this interpretation, the Prosecution would have proven the charge beyond reasonable doubt. The long title to the Act states that it is “for the control of dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs and substances and for purposes connected therewith”. Part II of the Act establishes offences of trafficking, manufacture, import and export, possession and consumption of controlled drugs specified in the First Schedule. Part III contains rules of evidence pertaining to prosecutions under the Act, provisions pertaining to enforcement and forfeiture and sets out the punishments for various offences. There are several sections setting up presumptions, including s 18. Part IV deals with treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts. Part V contains provisions empowering the taking of photographs of and body samples from persons under supervision. Part VI deals with the establishment of committees of inquiry for matters connected with discipline and other functions of any approved institution for rehabilitation of drug addicts. Considering the Act as a whole, and the parliamentary debates dealing with its enactment in 1973, it is clear that the Act was enacted to deal with the problem of narcotic drug abuse and addiction. It punishes persons not only for trafficking, but also for consumption of controlled drugs. It provides for incarceration for the purposes of rehabilitation of drug addicts. It would not be inaccurate to state that the general policy underlying the Act is that of reducing and even eradicating narcotic drug abuse in Singapore. The next question is whether taking the first interpretation or the second would further the policy or undermine it. There is no doubt that adopting the first interpretation would make it much easier for the Prosecution to secure a conviction in cases where the presumption in s 18(2) of the Act is required to be invoked. But it is quite a different thing to say that making it easier for the Prosecution to secure a conviction would promote the general policy of the Act whereas making it more difficult to do so would undermine it. Our system of criminal justice requires the Prosecution to prove an accused person’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt in order to secure a conviction. The presumption in s 18(2) of the Act shifts the burden of proof of knowledge to the accused person once the conditions therein are met. The legislature had decided where the line should be drawn in relation to that burden. If, as the CA in Tan Kiam Peng ([12] supra) held, the ordinary meaning of the words in s 18(2) point to the second interpretation, then it is my respectful opinion that there cannot be room for any consideration as to whether this meaning “undermines the general policy” of the Act as Parliament had decided on this line as the appropriate balance between burden on the Prosecution and on the accused.\n",

It is not disputed that the accused physically brought the diamorphine into Singapore and that he was not authorised to do so. The only issue is whether the mens rea of the offence is made out: whether the accused knew, or is taken to have known, that he was carrying diamorphine. The accused’s knowledge for the purposes of section 7 may be proved:\n",
      "(a)     by establishing that the accused had actual knowledge that he was carrying diamorphine;\n",
      "(b)     by showing that the accused was wilfully blind to the fact that he was carrying diamorphine; and\n",
      "(c)     by relying on the presumption in section 18(2) of the MDA whereby the accused is presumed by law to have known the nature of the drug he was carrying (in this case, diamorphine). I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this represents a direct admission of actual knowledge that the drug inside the brown paper wrapped packet was in fact specifically heroin particularly when the accused had qualified his admission by stating that he did not know what type of drug it was. However I am satisfied that the admission clearly shows that he had actual knowledge that the brown paper wrapped packet contained some form of controlled drug, but he did not know its exact nature ie the drug could well be heroin or other types of controlled drugs. Although the statement was made at about 11.05pm on 19 December 2009, after the accused had been told by Sergeant Kumar at his arrest at 9.05pm that the brown paper packet contained “drugs”, the manner in which the accused answered the above direct question posed by Sergeant Kumar to him indicates to me that he had personal knowledge that the brown paper wrapped packet contained controlled drugs even before Sergeant Kumar had told him so. If indeed, he did not know at all what was inside the packet prior to being informed by Sergeant Kumar, his obvious answer would have been to the effect that “I do not know what is inside but you told me it is drugs.” Had he really suspected that the packet contained money, electronic parts or gold as he now claimed, then I would have expected the substance of his answer to be as follows: “I suspect the packet contains money, electronic parts or gold but you told me that it is drugs.” In my opinion, the accused’s answer itself suggested that he was answering Sergeant Kumar’s simple and direct question “What is this?” from his personal knowledge when he said basically that he did not know what type of controlled drug the brown paper wrapped parcel contained, giving rise to the inference that he actually knew it contained some form of controlled drug, the actual nature of which was not known to him. In any event, I believe that the accused had understood Sergeant Kumar to be asking him about his personal knowledge of what was inside the brown paper wrapped packet. It would have been a complete waste of time for Sergeant Kumar to ask the accused effectively the question “What is this based on what I have told you before?” I also do not believe that the accused understood the question in this way and I thus disagree with the defence’s contention that the accused’s answer to that question from Sergeant Kumar was based not on the accused’s personal knowledge but merely from what Sergeant Kumar had told him earlier. The accused is accordingly found guilty as charged. I convict him and sentence him to death as mandated by section 33 of the MDA. The accused, Dinesh Pillai A/L Raja Retnam (“the accused”), is a 27-year old Indian Malaysian who lived in Skudai, a town close to Johor Bahru in Malaysia. The eldest child of a family of five, he was penniless and unemployed in December 2009. He had a girlfriend whom he was planning to marry. He was going to start work in January 2010 at Universal Studios Singapore with a salary of $1,100. Life was about to improve for the accused. But on 19 December 2009, while travelling from Johor Bahru, he was arrested at the Singapore Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint (“Woodlands Checkpoint”). A brown paper wrapped packet found under his motorcycle seat was subsequently analysed and found to contain diamorphine – commonly known as heroin. He is charged with an offence under section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) of importing, without lawful authority, not less than 19.35 grams of diamorphine into Singapore, a capital offence under section 33 of the MDA.\n",

      " I found that the accused had sold Mohammed Firdaus the packet of methamphetamine on 30 May 2011 and that he knew that he was selling methamphetamine as he had used the street name “ice.” I also found that the quantity of methamphetamine was such that it was capable of being possessed, sold, and consumed (which was in fact what happened). Therefore, I found that the prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted the accused on the trafficking charge. Based on Mohammed Firdaus’ testimony, I was also satisfied that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no reason for him to frame the accused since they were childhood friends. Counsel’s suggestion that the authorities offered to treat him more leniently in return for framing the accused was pure speculation and a baseless attack on the integrity of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”).[note: 2] In essence the defence is alleging that the CNB, instead of asking Mohammed Firdaus for the identity of the actual drug dealer and putting a stop to his activities, decided to frame an innocent person. Such allegations should not be made lightly and there should be some basis for making them. As far as I could tell, Counsel had no basis to make such an allegation. After I convicted the accused on the trafficking charge, he pleaded guilty to one charge of possessing Methamphetamine and one charge of consuming Methamphetamine. I sentenced the accused to a total sentence of 5 years’ and 9 months’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane. As the accused has appealed against the conviction and sentence imposed, I will now set out the reasons for my decision.\n",

      " Based on the agreed facts as laid out at the beginning of these grounds, all the elements for the offence of trafficking in the controlled drug were made out. Mr Kumar informed the Court that the only defence proffered by the accused is that the amount of Methamphetamine in this case was not determined as it was of a minute amount and therefore the act of trafficking in the drug cannot stand. In support of his argument, Mr Kumar tendered the following cases:\n",
      "a)      Ng Yang Sek v PP [1997] 2 SLR(R) 816 (\"Ng Yang Sek\") for the proposition that the accused does not fall within the class of offenders which Parliament had in mind when it enacted section 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.\n",
      "b)      Williams v R [1978] HCA 49 (\"Williams\") for the proposition by analogy that when the Act created the offence of trafficking without adverting to quantity, it had contemplated not of a minute quantity incapable of discernment by the naked eye and detectable only by scientific means, but a possession of such a quantity as makes it reasonable to say as a matter of commonsense and reality that it is the drug of which the person has presently trafficked.\n",
      "c)      R v Boyesen [1982] 1 AC 768 (\"Boyesen\") for the proposition that the possession of any quantity, which is visible, tangible, measurable and capable of manipulation is a serious matter to be prohibited if the law is to be effective against trafficking in dangerous drugs and their misuse. By implication, the amount here is so small that it could not amount to trafficking. I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case against the accused of trafficking in Methamphetamine, a controlled drug, beyond a reasonable doubt. In my view, the defence was unmeritorious and the appeal is frivolous. After the accused was convicted on the drug trafficking charge, he pleaded guilty to the second charge of consuming Methamphetamine and the Court was asked to pass sentence on both convictions. Even though the accused had claimed trial to the drug trafficking charge and would not be entitled to the usual discount for early plea of guilt and a show of remorse, and even though the defence is unmeritorious, I have decided that the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane is sufficient punishment in view of his age (20 at the time of the commission of this offence and 21 at the time of conviction and 22 at the time of sentence) and the lack of any criminal antecedent. Therefore, both the sentence for the drug trafficking offence and the sentence for the drug consumption offence (which was 9 months' imprisonment) were ordered to run concurrently. The accused had decided to start serving his sentence from yesterday. These facts are not disputed and are found in the Agreed Statement of Facts. The accused admitted that he had sold a packet of \"Ice\" to Sheila for $35. The accused had also admitted that when Sheila contacted him to purchase the drug, they did not discuss the price as he had previously mentioned to her that 0.1 gram would cost about $35 and 0.2 gram would cost about $60. The accused was therefore charged with trafficking in a Class 'A' controlled drug. When the charge was read to the accused on the day of trial, he pleaded not guilty.\n",

I was of the view that there should be no differentiation in this case. The accused has been convicted on a charge of knowingly importing the diamorphine and he should be sentenced on this basis. As the accused has appealed against the sentence imposed, I will now set out the reasons for my decision. The accused’s mitigation plea also made references to a number of recent cases involving trafficking or importation of a similar amount of diamorphine:\n",
      "a)      PP v Jayakumar A/L Sivasubramani [2011] SGDC 377: The accused was charged with importing 7.58 grams of diamorphine and 141 grams of Cannabis. The accused was a motorist who was found with the drugs at Woodlands Checkpoint. The accused was sentenced to 9 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for the importation of diamorphine and 6 years and 5 strokes for the importation of cannabis. His total sentence was 9 years and 11 strokes of the cane.\n",
      "b)      PP v Danial  Punithanayagam [2011] SGDC 342: The accused was charged with importing 8.45 grams of diamorphine. The accused was a motorcyclist who was stopped at Woodlands checkpoint and drugs were found in his helmet. He was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. Counsel for the accused, in his mitigation plea, did not argue for the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment. Instead, he submitted that there were mitigating factors which reduced the culpability of the offender and therefore merited a sentence in the region of 6 to 8 years’ imprisonment and caning. I will now examine these factors and explain the weight I placed on them in determining the sentence.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, the court agrees with the prosecution’s submission that the accused had actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs in the helmet (P3) or was wilfully blind to it. The accused did not make any effort to check the contents of the helmet (P3) and his explanations of the fear of the co-accused cannot be supported in the light of the surrounding circumstances as explained above. The defence has failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that the accused had no knowledge of the nature of the drugs (diamorphine) and has not rebutted the presumption under section 18(2) of the MDA. The court is satisfied that taking the evidence in totality and the circumstances of the case, the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had imported the drugs diamorphine under section 7 of the MDA and had knowledge of the drugs in his possession (inside the helmet P3) as well as the nature of the drug(diamorphine). The accused was found guilty and convicted on the importation charge. The accused is facing a charge for importing a controlled drug (Diamorphine) specified in Class ‘A’ of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) under section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act and punishable under section 33 of the aforesaid Act. The accused claimed trial to the charge and at the end of the trial, he was found guilty and convicted accordingly. He was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years and 15 strokes of the cane. He is appealing against the conviction. At the close of the prosecution’s case, the court was satisfied that the prosecution had established a prima facie case for calling of the defence which if unrebutted would warrant a conviction. After the caution was administered to the accused by the court, the accused elected to give evidence on oath. The prosecution submitted that for the foregoing reasons, the defence has failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the accused had no knowledge of the nature of the drug. Thus, the defence has not rebutted the presumption under section 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.\n",

      " At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt against the Accused in respect of the charge. I accepted his contemporaneous statement and found that the Accused knew that he was importing 3 packets of diamorphine into Singapore on 25 May 2011 at or about 10.32 pm and had not done so under duress. Accordingly, I convicted the Accused on DAC 033844 - 2012 and imposed a sentence 25 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane with effect from 26 May 2011. After a careful consideration of the evidence as well as the submissions before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution has proven that on 25 May 2011 at or about 10.32 p.m. at the Bike Arrival Channel of Woodlands Check Point, Singapore, the Accused had imported not less than 14.99 grams of diamorphine under Section 7 Misuse of Drugs Act without authorization beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently, I rejected his defence that he had been forced to bring the drugs into Singapore under duress. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the said charge. At the close of the Prosecution’s case, after a careful consideration of the evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses as well as the submissions before me, I was satisfied that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the Accused which if unrebutted by the Accused, would warrant the conviction in respect of the charge. In the present case, there was some evidence which was not inherently incredible which satisfied each and every element of the charge. The drug exhibits marked “A1A”, “A2A” and “A3A” were all found on the Accused, sandwiched between his waist and his jeans after he entered into Singapore on 25 May 2011 at or about 10.32 pm and in his unchallenged contemporaneous statement (Exhibit P31) when asked what the three bundles were, the Accused had informed PW7 that it contained heroin. The onus thus lay on the Accused to rebut the prosecution’s case against him. Accordingly, the standard allocution was administered and the Accused elected to give evidence. Dissatisfied with my decision, the Accused has filed a Notice of Appeal against his conviction and sentence on 21 August 2013. He is now serving his sentence in Cluster B. His earliest date of release is on 25 January 2028.\n",

      " In the light of my findings of facts in [7] above as well as the prosecution’s case as stated in [8] above, and having regard to the definition of the word ‘traffic’ in section 2 of MDA to mean, inter alia, to ‘sell, give, send, or offer to sell, give, send’, it was clear to me that the AP had trafficked in a controlled drug listed in Part I (Class A) of the First Schedule to the MDA by having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking one packet containing 1.16 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain 0.85 gram of methamphetamine, without authorisation under the MDA. I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the AP and I found the AP guilty and convicted him of the drug trafficking charge preferred against him in DAC 3779/2012. Having considered the written and oral submissions and replies of the parties together with the evidence that had been adduced during the trial, which was duly recorded by the digital audio recording and transcription (“DART”) system, I was satisfied that the prosecution had established its case beyond reasonable doubt against the AP at the close of the trial. Accordingly, I convicted the AP of the charge preferred against him on 30 September 2013. At the close of the prosecution’s case, I applied the test in Haw Tua Tau v PP [1980-1981] SLR 73 and was satisfied that a prima facie case had been made out against the AP on each element or ingredient of the proceeded charge for which the AP faced, which if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. Accordingly, I administered the standard allocution to the AP and called for his defence. The AP elected to give evidence in his own defence. Having heard the evidence of all the prosecution and defence witnesses, including the AP, I found all the 9 prosecution witnesses to be truthful witnesses as they had no reason to lie and frame the AP. I accepted all the evidence of the prosecution witnesses insofar as they are material to prove the drug trafficking charge against the AP. Having regard to the material inconsistences between the AP’s oral evidence given in Court and his statements in P2, P5 and P6, I was of the view that the AP’s statements in P2, P5 and P6 were more reliable as they were made voluntarily and closer to the time of the commission of the alleged offence and the AP had every incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts in Court in order to exculpate himself [note: 4]. I rejected all the AP’s oral evidence given in Court as afterthoughts to exculpate himself insofar as they are inconsistent with his statements in P2, P5 and P6, or immaterial to prove the drug trafficking charge against the AP. Therefore, I found the following relevant facts:\n",
      "i    No vulgarity, physical contact, abuse, violence or assault was used on the AP at the time of his arrest by any of the CNB officers, PW3 (who had identified himself as a CNB officer to the AP) and PW4 (who assisted PW3 to arrest the AP) on 12 May 2012 at the car park of Block 44 Bedok South Road and during the CNB raid on his friend’s Bedok flat and his family’s Yishun flat. PW4 did not slap the AP at any time.\n",
      "ii     PW1 was not the arresting officer but he had made the police arrest report in P1 which detailed the arrest of the AP at the car park of Block 44 Bedok South Road by CNB officers on 23 May 2012 at 0416 hours, the seizure of various items, including drug packets at the time of the arrest, and also the raid on the AP’s mother’s Yishun flat by CNB officers and seizure of utensils used by the AP for drug consumption from his flat.\n",
      "iii     The AP had put up a violent struggle during the arrest and necessary force was used to effect the arrest (as stated in the police arrest report in P1). The AP was very tense and when PW4 tried to handcuff him, he resisted and force had to be used to pull his hands from the side to the back to handcuff him and no other physical contact was made with the AP. After been handcuffed, the AP told PW3 and PW4 that he was breathless and they made him sit down on the floor to recover from his breathlessness. Other than his breathlessness, the AP was in a normal condition at the time of his arrest on 22 May 2012 and did not faint after his arrest.\n",
      "iv     PW3 arrested the AP by placing both his arms on the AP’s upper arms and grabbed him from behind after identifying himself as a CNB officer and the AP tensed up and resisted arrest and refused to give his hands for handcuff when PW4 tried to handcuff him. The AP’s handphone was not ringing at the time of his arrest. When PW3 grabbed the AP with his arms from behind, the AP could still retaliate and resist when PW4 tried to handcuff him as the AP did not take out his handphone which was ringing to silence it.\n",
      "v    PW4 did a frisk search on the AP and recovered the items as stated in the police arrest report in P1, including P3 which was a drug item he seized from the AP and sent later to HSA for analysis on PW8’s instruction.\n",
      "vi     All the statements in P2 and also in P5 and P6 were given respectively by the AP to PW1 and PW8 voluntarily without any inducement, threat and promise.\n",
      "vii     No conditional question was asked of the AP by PW1 during the recording of the AP’s statement in P2 and there was no AP’s answer to any such conditional question which had been taken as evidence of his confession to the current charge preferred against him. P2 did not have any conditional questions except in question 8 in P2 on what the AP would do if the persons to whom he sold the drugs did not pay him to which the AP replied he would not do anything. PW1 did not ask the AP a conditional question : ‘Kalau Kau jual berapa’ (in Malay) or ‘if you sell, how much’ (in English) or any other conditional question (such as ‘if my friend was having a cold turkey syndrome, how much I would sell my drugs to him’) which was not reflected in P2. During his interview of the AP for recording of his statement in P2 conducted in Malay, PW1 asked him the questions as stated in P2 and wrote down whatever the AP said in his answers to these questions. At the end of the interview, PW1 read the statement in P2 back to the AP in Malay who agreed to his answers and signed the statement in P2. He did not ask the AP any other questions which were not reflected in his statement in P2.\n",
      "viii     PW2’s translation of the AP’s statement in P2 from Malay into English in P2.1 was a proper translation by a qualified CNB interpreter.\n",
      "ix     PW5 who was not involved in interviewing the AP might have listened to the AP’s interview by PW1 conducted in Malay to record his statement in P2, but PW5 could not understand Malay and hence was not in a position to remind PW1 to keep on asking the AP questions during the recording.\n",
      "x    The AP was not suffering from any drug withdrawal symptoms or the direct effects of drug consumption and was in a fit and proper condition during the recording of his statements in P2, P5 and P6. The AP did not at any time tell, indicate or complain to PW1, PW3, PW4, PW5, PW6 and PW8 at the time of his arrest or during the recording of his statements in P2, P5 and P6 that he was feeling unwell and was suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms, and as far as these CNB officers perceived, the AP did not look unwell. The AP did not faint as when PW5 reached the Block 44 Bedok South car park, she saw the AP standing up and was handcuffed and he was in a good condition and did not display any discomfit when he was handed over to PW5. PW6 saw the AP sweating outside the CNB car due to the weather and not because of his withdrawal symptoms or any sickness.\n",
      "xi     After the AP’s urine samples were taken at Bedok Police Station, he requested to see a doctor and was escorted by PW5 and PW6 (and another male officer whose name PW5 could not recall) to Alexandra Hospital where PW9 took blood tests and asked the AP questions and after a few hours, certified that the AP was fit and discharged him from hospital without giving him any medication. The AP was then brought to the Central Police Division. PW9 was satisfied based on objective indicators (such as heart rate and respiratory rate) that the AP was fit to provide a reliable statement and was not suffering from withdrawal symptoms, despite the fact that there was some residual methamphetamine remained in his body. In addition, the AP was able to answer repeated questions from PW9 in a consistent manner. PW9 had testified that the medical report in P7 was correct and there is no evidence of any other contrary medical report as alleged by the AP. During the journey from Bedok Police Division to Alexandra Hospital, the AP was not suffering from any withdrawal symptoms as PW5 did not notice any such symptoms on the AP and he was sleeping as anyone would feel sleepy at that time of between 2 to 4 am when the AP was brought to the hospital.\n",
      "xii     The AP was conversant in both Malay and English and was able to speak in a mix of both languages and understood all that were asked, read and explained to him by PW1 and PW8 in either Malay, English or a mix of both languages during the recording of his statements in P2, P5 and P6.\n",
      "xiii     There was no proof of physical drug and monetary transaction and record to show that the AP was trafficking in drugs and there was no self-made marking or price tag on the drugs seized from the AP to prove that these drugs were for trafficking, but there was one packet with 12.5 written on it (as stated in the police arrest report in P1). When the drugs were found in the AP’s right pocket, there was no evidence that he was going to sell the drugs.\n",
      "xiv     The AP had admitted in his statement in P2 with the English translation in P2.1 that one plastic container inside containing 3 packets was ‘air Batu’ (in Malay) or street name for Ice which he got from a Malaysian inmate with no payment to him and they belonged to the AP and were for his self- consumption and if anybody wants, he will give and sell 1 or 2, depending on how much they can afford to pay and sometimes if they do not pay, he did not do anything.\n",
      "xv     The HSA certificate in P4 showed that one packet containing 1.16 grams of crystalline substance was pulverised and homogenised into a powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain 0.85 gram of methamphetamine.\n",
      "xvi     In his statement in P5, the AP had admitted to the following:\n",
      "(a)       he did not reside with his family at Block 274, Yishun Street 22 #12-156 as he rarely went back to his family’s flat and would usually be staying at his friend's place located at Block 44 Bedok South Road.\n",
      "(b)       3 packets of methamphetamine which were seized from the AP’s front right hand pocket of his shorts which he admitted belonged to him and he had gotten and bought from one 'Bon' (whom he had gotten to know from an inmate named Sofian while he was in prison) and were (to quote P5) “meant for both my own consumption and for selling. The drug exhibit in P3 is meant for selling while the rest is for his own consumption.” He would repack each set into 6 (containing 0.2g) or 12 (containing 0.lg) smaller packets. These are meant for his own consumption however if his friend wants to buy from him, he will sell to them for S$20/- for 0.lg and 0.2g is sold for S$40/- to S$50/- depending on the person who is asking. In all, he has sold methamphetamine somewhere between 5 to 20 occasions. He cannot remember exactly how many times he has sold methamphetamine for. The reason he sold methamphetamine was to get by his daily expenses as his pay was not enough to last him through the day. He last sold methamphetamine a day prior to his arrest. He had sold 0.2g of methamphetamine to one 'Andy' for S$50.\n",

      "xix     As PW1 and PW8 had no reason to fabricate any parts of the statements they had recorded from the AP, I totally rejected the AP’s claim that PW8 was incompetent and had fabricated the more serious drug trafficking charge in the AP’s statement in P5 just because the other drug possession and possession of drug utensils charges against the AP were minor charges (which the AP was prepared to admit) as compared to the drug trafficking charge and PW8 could only hold the AP in custody for 48 hours to take his statement.\n",

      " The prosecution objected to probation and submitted that due to the serious nature of the drug trafficking offence in DAC 24697/2013, the appropriate sentence is RTC, while the defence is of the view of that probation should be the appropriate sentence. After careful consideration of the written submissions of both parties, I rejected the prosecution submission and took the view that it would be sufficient deterrence for the present MDA offences to impose on the AP a maximum period of 36 months’ probation with voluntary residence at a residential facility (The New Charis Mission) for a period of 12 months; 6 months’ electronic tagging upon his discharge from the New Charis Mission; 240 hours of community service; indoor time restriction between 10 pm to 6 am; undergoing of regular urine test; a Court review in 15 months’ time; and for his mother and maternal uncle to be bonded to ensure his good behaviour during probation. My reasons are as follows:\n",
      "(i)     While I agreed with the prosecution that drug trafficking counts as one of those serious crimes (not unlike a harassment offence under the Moneylenders Act[note: 24]) with deterrence as a dominant sentencing principle, I am unable to agree with the prosecution’s broad brush approach against the grant of probation to every young drug trafficker because the Court has to, “especially where young offenders were involved, carefully assess the facts in each case and not apply the general rule of deterrence as a matter of course. There are many facets to public interest. It cannot be in the public interest that every young drug offender be incarcerated and be exposed to the negative influences of hardened criminals in the prison environment. The rehabilitation of the young who had gone astray is a fundamental tenet of our society” and “society would indeed want to see young offenders turning over a new leaf to become law abiding citizens who would make positive contributions to its development”[note: 25].\n",
      "(ii)     If it had been Parliament's intention to take away the option of rehabilitation of young offenders (by way of probation or reformative training as may be considered by the Court to be appropriate in a particular case) in relation to a particular offence or a category of offences (such as drug trafficking offences), then this intention had to be made clear in the statute[note: 26]. I note that the MDA did not specifically prohibit the Court from placing a young drug trafficker on probation if the Court found it appropriate to do so. In fact, the law on probation was explicitly amended to apply specifically to young offenders even if they had committed offences punishable with specified minimum sentences[note: 27] (such as the present MDA drug trafficking offences) which are generally the more serious offences.\n",
      "(iii)     While I agreed with the prosecution that drug trafficking is a grave offence and the ills arising out of drug abuse and trafficking have been well documented, I was mindful that the nature of the offence is only one of many relevant factors which are to be taken into account in arriving at an appropriate sentence. Both general and specific deterrence must be scrupulously assessed and measured and it is clearly insufficient for the prosecution to merely allude to deterrence of a serious crime in our present case as the basis for imposing a stiff sentence as deterrence is not a “stock phrase for want of something better”[note: 28]. The guiding principle in assessing the suitability of probation is the likelihood of success of the attempted rehabilitation[note: 29] and probation has been granted for drug trafficking offences where the offender is found to be suitable for and deserving of probation.[note: 30] On balance, I found that the AP has good prospects for rehabilitation and that an intensive probation order together with the stringent conditions and programmes (as recommended in the PR and SPR) will not detract from the aim of both specific and general deterrence. The aforesaid stringent probation conditions (set out in [11] above) must exert some degree of deterrence on young offenders[note: 31] such as the AP as there will still be an element of restriction of the AP’s liberty under the terms of the intensive probation order and very severe consequences if he breaches the order. The AP should therefore be given a chance and permitted of his own volition to reform and rehabilitate himself through help from his family and the community without the need for reformative training.\n",
      "(iv)     In my view, Parliament did not intend in the Probation of Offenders Act and the MDA that all young drug traffickers must be punished with a RTC sentence (or the prescribed minimum imprisonment term with mandatory caning) as a broad brush approach (which appeared to have been advocated by the prosecution) in order to send out a strong deterrent message to deter the AP and other young drug traffickers and protect our youths and society from drug traffickers and syndicates. The prosecution submission in this regard is simply contrary to the legislative intent and the sentencing considerations, principles and precedents applicable to young drug offenders. Again, I must stress that I have reached this decision on the basis of a close analysis of the particular facts of this case. Any court faced with a similar sentencing decision must to do the same. I therefore cannot accept the prosecution’s submission that making a probation order in this case will send the signal to all future similar offenders that they can similarly expect to be placed on probation.\n",
      "(v)     While drug trafficking is a serious offence, I find that our present case falls within the class of cases where the “individual offender’s capacity for rehabilitation is demonstrably high” such that “this may outweigh the public policy concerns that are traditionally understood as militating against probation”[note: 32]. This is because of the AP’s genuine remorse as demonstrated by his willingness to cooperate with interviewers for the PR, SPR and RTC reports. As noted in the SPR, the AP has changed in his behaviour since his release from remand on 7 October 2013 as follows:\n",
      "(a)       The AP was cooperative during the social investigation process. He abided by the trial time restriction of 9pm daily. He was found to be indoors when a physical and telephone check were conducted on 30 October 2013.\n",
      "(b)       The AP had stopped smoking, consuming alcohol and abusing drugs and had begun volunteer work at Sree Narayana Mission Home since 17 October 2013 where his performance was reported to be sarisfactory. He acknowledged that engaging in a drug lifestyle was harmful to his health. He hoped to pursue his studies for the GCE 'A' level examination as a private candidate again after completing the GCE 'O' equivalent in India in 2012.\n",
      "(c)       The AP acknowledged the severity of his offences and expressed his willingness to enrol himself into a residential programme to mend his ways. He is aware that The New Charis Mission is a faith-based hostel but opined that he could benefit from its structured residential programme and guidance from the staff there. It would also be an opportunity for him to meet his family regularly. He is confident that he would be able to follow the hostel regime and to abide by probation conditions.\n",
      "(d)       In terms of familial support, the AP’s relationship with his maternal uncle was initially strained in 2012 as the AP did not heed his advice. However, their relationship improved after the AP’s mother was sentenced to imprisonment in 24 April 2013. His maternal uncle reported that that he noted a marked improvement in the AP’s behaviour since he was released from remand. He appeared to demonstrate responsible behavior at home. He kept his uncle informed of his whereabouts, ceased contact with his negative peers, stopped smoking and abided by the time restriction of 9 pm imposed by the PO. His uncle acknowledged that The New Charis Mission programme would benefit the AP and help him overcome his drug-related issues and expressed willingness for the AP to reside there. As for the AP’s mother, she would be emplaced on a Community Based Programme in November 2013 and is herself keen to undergo intervention for herself so as to better manage the AP during his probation. She felt that the AP would benefit from the guidance and supervision from The New Charis Mission programme as well.\n",
      "(e)       The police arrest and court appearance had highlighted to the AP the severity of the offences and the need to address his drug taking habit. The AP had spent a considerable time in remand from 28 May 2013 to 5 October 2013 which was a wake-up call for him. Since his release from remand, the AP has shown some internal motivation to make changes to his lifestyle. He has been constructively engaged and his expressed willingness to admit himself into The New Charis Mission prior to been sentenced by this Court are indicative of his readiness to make positive changes to his life. The maternal uncle's support is also reflected in his pro-activeness in seeking relevant community resources for the AP. This, coupled with the mother's willingness to undergo intervention upon her release from prison as well as the close relationship the AP shares with the mother is indicative of the support available from the family. These protective factors bode well for community-based rehabilitation.\n",
      "(f)       The AP’s risk of re-offending is assessed by the PO to be moderate. Given his risk and needs issues and the presence of protective factors, the PO had assessed that a period of residence in a residential facility (such as The New Charis Mission0 which specializes in a drug rehabilitation programme for youth would benefit him. The structure from probation and the 12-month participation in a drug rehabilitation programme, together with other measures such as regular urine tests and engagement in education and life skill programmes would provide the AP the targeted intervention for his rehabilitation. In my view, the Individual Case Management Plan which was prepared by the probation officer with a fair amount of experience in this field (as set out in the PR) would specifically address the causes of the AP’s present offences and his future conduct.\n",
      "(g)       The AP has been scheduled to enlist for National Service sometime between December 2013 and March 2014. The regimented environment during National Service will provide the AP with an added ‘protective factor’ that will fortify the message of been law compliant and instil respect for the law. [note: 33]\n",
      "(vi)     Like the Court in Wong, I must emphasise that this case turns on its own facts. Therefore, in my opinion, a probation order will not undermine the principle of general deterrence. In our present case, probation with the above additional stringent conditions will be sufficient to serve as a form of deterrence without a RT sentence. While the AP has had contact with “bad company”[note: 34], he has ceased contact with his negative peers according to his maternal uncle and is no longer under the influence of this company. I also note that the AP will face serious consequences should he breach the terms of his probation order. If he does so, the court has the power to deal with him as though he had “just been convicted”.[note: 35] A probation order will therefore not detract very much from the aim of both specific and general deterrence as the potential consequences of a breach of the probation order can be as severe as sending the AP to RTC or even sentencing him to the minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane as prescribed for the current offence, if the AP is found, after a breach of his probation, to be unsuitable for an RTC sentence.\n",
      "(vii)     I am mindful that probation is rare in cases such as this one and that there are strong arguments in favour of general deterrence, especially given the seriousness of the current 7 MDA offences committed by the AP, particularly the drug trafficking offence. However, there is no evidence that the AP had hitherto gone to the extent of trafficking drugs in a big way as he had no intention to use the drugs from the cannabis plant for consumption or for sale and had intended to sell drugs to only one potential customer when he was arrested before he could meet up with the customer to sell to him a straw of diamorphine at $20 which the AP had obtained from an unknown male known to him as 'Sha Boy' on 25 April 2013 near a coffeeshop at Yio Chu Kang MRT Station and was instructed by the 'Sha Boy' to sell the diamorphine at the aforesaid price. The AP sold diamorphine because of 'prestige' and felt that he was someone whom people could turn to if they wanted drugs. I agreed with the Defence submission that the AP had unfortunately turned to drugs to feel accepted which happened during a time when attention from his family was lacking and he somehow saw drugs as an easy avenue to compensate for the lack of familial attention, which has since changed as both his mother and uncle are now committed (with the help of the probation officer) to provide him with the necessary supervision and support for his rehabilitation. For all the above reasons, I ordered that the AP be placed on intensive probation for a period of 36 months (instead of the 30 months probation recommended in the SPR), subject to a Court review in 15 months’ time scheduled on 27 February 2015, with the conditions that he must:\n",
      "(i)     Voluntarily reside at a residential facility (The New Charis Mission) for a period of 12 months;\n",
      "(ii)     Be electronically tagged for 6 months upon his discharge from the New Charis Mission;\n",
      "(iii)     Abide by a time restriction of 10 pm to 6 am unless otherwise varied by the Probation Services Branch, in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Court;\n",
      "(iv)     Perform 240 hours of community service (instead of 200 hours as recommended in the probation report);\n",
      "(v)     Undergo regular urine tests. The accused person (AP), a 18-year-old male Singaporean pleaded guilty to the following 3 charges:\n",
      "(i)     DAC 15168/2013: cultivation of drugs under s10 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185) (MDA) and punishable with a minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment or a fine of SGD5,000 or both.\n",
      "(ii)     DAC 15171/2013: consumption of a specified drug under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and punishable with imprisonment of up to 10 years or fine of SGD20,000 or both.\n",
      "(iii)     DAC 24697/201: trafficking of a controlled drug under section 5(1)(a) of the MDA and punishable with a minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane and a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The AP also consented to 4 other charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. These 4 charges are as follows:\n",
      "(i)     DAC 15169/2013: possession of a controlled drug under s 8(a) of the MDA.\n",
      "(ii)     DAC 15170/2013: possession of a controlled drug under s 8(a) of the MDA.\n",

I informed the accused that the quantity of drug stated in the charge was based on the actual weight determined by the drug analysis and the discretion to frame a lesser charge rested with the prosecution.

      " Having considered the evidence and the submissions of counsel I was of the view that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused and I thus found him guilty as charged and convicted him accordingly. It was a poor defence. First, I am not convinced that the accused could mistake a blue cloth bag for the black PVC bag. Secondly, the accused admitted that some of the articles found in the black bag were his and had been in the blue bag. The idea that whoever planted the drugs in the black bag also transferred the belongings of the accused so that he could bring the black bag into Singapore was utterly absurd. Thirdly, the accused testified that he bought some duck eggs and kept them in his (blue) bag. It transpired in the course of the trial that the eggs were in the black bag. The now rotten eggs were discovered by the CNB only at trial. It is of no relevance why they were not discovered sooner; but the point was that if the accused claimed that he had placed the eggs into his own bag and the eggs were found in the black bag, the inescapable conclusion must be that he had only one bag – the black one. I disbelieved his evidence that his bag was a blue cloth bag. Fourthly, there was evidence of the accused person’s DNA found on some of the items in the black bag, including the glass tubes and glass pipes found in the side compartment. Fifthly, the accused’s DNA was also found on some of the ten bundles of heroin seized from the black bag. Lastly, the accused could not explain in his testimony why he did not tell the officers at the Woodlands Checkpoint and then again during the recording of the statements taken pursuant to s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (the “CPC”) that the black bag did not belong to him. Counsel for the accused offered an explanation based on contamination and transference of the DNA, namely, either by accident or by some innocuous way. It was merely a hypothesis that was neither supported by scientific evidence or factual evidence. In any event, even if I were to give the accused the benefit of doubt that his DNA was found on some of the bundles in innocent circumstances, the overall evidence left me with no doubt that the accused knew that he was carrying heroin and I also found as a fact that the black bag was his. I was satisfied that the evidence had shown beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had imported the heroin from Johor to Singapore.\n",

Thus, I found the accused guilty of the two charges and convicted him accordingly.\n",

      " The accused was charged with importing not less than 94.96g of diamorphine into Singapore, an offence under s 7 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). On 5 August 2013, I convicted the accused and handed down a written judgment explaining my reasons for doing so (PP v Chum Tat Suan [2013] SGHC 150). Prior to 1 January 2013, when a number of legislative amendments came into effect, a sentence of death would have been mandatory upon such a conviction. However, the newly-enacted s 33B of the Act provides that, in certain circumstances, a sentence of death that would have been mandatory will no longer be so. Parties accordingly sought, and I granted, an adjournment to prepare submissions on sentence. In my view, this procedure gives rise to a significant difficulty. I have already convicted the accused on the basis of findings of fact that I have made. But now I have to make new findings on at least one question of fact for the purposes of sentencing, which is whether the accused was no more than a “courier”. If I allow parties to introduce new evidence on this question of fact, there is the possibility of evidence emerging that might undermine the findings of facts that I had earlier made in convicting the accused. There is even the possibility of evidence emerging that casts doubt on the guilt of the accused. On the other hand, if I do not allow the introduction of any new evidence, and premise my decision on sentencing exclusively on the findings of fact that I have already made and the evidence that had been adduced at trial, there is a possibility of prejudice to the accused, in that he might have conducted his defence in such manner as to furnish no occasion for evidence of his being no more than a “courier” to emerge at trial. This would make it difficult or impossible for him now to prove, without introducing further evidence on the question, that he was no more than a “courier”. I think that this difficulty is not confined to the present case but is one which may afflict all cases in which the accused faces a capital charge under the Act. If evidence relevant to the questions of whether the accused was a “courier” and whether the accused suffered such mental abnormality as substantially impaired his mental responsibility is only introduced after the accused has been convicted, there is the possibility of that evidence interfering with the findings of fact already made by the court in convicting the accused. The alternative is to make it a rule that evidence relevant to those questions must be adduced at trial, so that the court decides the issues of conviction and sentence together, or, if the court hands down a conviction before hearing submissions on sentence, the submissions may be based only on the evidence adduced at trial. But this alternative puts the accused in a bind. This is because, in order to make the claim that he was no more than a “courier”, the accused must first admit that he was trafficking or importing or exporting drugs. Choosing not to admit this might subsequently preclude him from arguing that he was no more than a “courier” should the court convict him nonetheless. For instance, if the accused elects to remain silent because he is of the opinion that the Prosecution has not made out a case against him, and the court convicts him anyway, he would not have had the opportunity to give evidence for the purposes of proving that he was no more than a “courier”. If his case was that he did not know that he had drugs in his possession, or that he had them in his possession for his own personal consumption, the evidence he gives and adduces at trial would be directed towards proving that case rather than that he was no more than a “courier”. Consequently, should the court disbelieve his defence and convict him, it would be difficult or impossible for him to argue that he was no more than a “courier”. One response might be that the accused must take a position and stick with it. But the onus is not on the accused to take positions. Since the Prosecution seeks to invoke the court’s authority to punish the accused, the onus is on the Prosecution to prove its case as to why the accused should be so punished. This must especially be so when the punishment sought to be visited on the accused is the sentence of death. I should now briefly describe what the heading to s 33B of the Act calls the “[d]iscretion of court not to impose sentence of death”. The Act’s terminology in this regard is not entirely accurate, because in one of the two sets of circumstances defined by s 33B the court has no discretion but must sentence the convicted accused to imprisonment for life instead of imposing the death penalty. Nonetheless, the language captures the thrust of s 33B, which is that it defines two sets of circumstances in which a sentence of death that would have been mandatory before the legislative amendments came into effect may not or cannot be imposed. One set of circumstances, defined by s 33B(2) read with s 33B(1)(a), might perhaps be termed for convenience the “substantive assistance” situation, because it requires that the Public Prosecutor certify that the accused substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities in order for the court to have the discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment plus caning instead of the sentence of death. The other set of circumstances, defined by s 33B(3) read with s 33B(1)(b), might perhaps be termed for convenience the “mental abnormality” situation, because it requires that the accused person suffered from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts in order for the court not to impose the sentence of death.\n",

      " This court should state the following at the very outset. It found the prosecution’s above closing submission very persuasive. The learned deputy public prosecutor, Mr Low Chun Yee, asked this court to draw the inferences stated in his Written Submission. This court found the prosecution’s various inferences not unreasonable. However, it was of the view, that these inferences might not be the only inferences that could be drawn. This was especially when the prosecution’s inferences were considered with the defence’s case in totality. For the accused to be convicted on the initial trafficking charge, the prosecution had to also, on the totality of the evidence adduced, prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. This court considered the legal principles stated in Sakthivel Punithavathi v Public Prosecutor [2007] 2 SLR(R) 983. The trial took six days. This court found that the prosecution had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. This court also concluded that, on a balance of probability, all the 108.96 grams of methamphetamine was for the accused’s own consumption. The methamphetamine was, therefore, not for the purpose of trafficking. This court also found in the alternative. All the drugs might not have been for the accused’s own consumption. This court found that, even if so, on a balance of probability, a substantial amount of the 108.96 grams of methamphetamine was for the accused’s own consumption. It, therefore, could not be presumed that the accused had the 108.96 grams of methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking. For all the above reasons, this court found that the prosecution had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. This court also concluded that the accused, on a balance of probability, possessed the 108.96 grams of methamphetamine, or a substantial amount of it, for his own consumption. The drugs, or a substantial amount of it, were, therefore, not for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was a high consumer of drugs. The drugs were for his acute depression at that time. He was contemplating consuming an overdose of the drugs to commit suicide. The accused pleaded to the above amended possession charge. He also pleaded guilty to two other charges. They were – (the 4th charge) for “failure to present for urine test”, under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the MDA (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Reg 3); and (the 5th charge) for “consumption of methamphetamine” with enhanced punishment because of a previous similar conviction. Two other charges were taken into consideration, for the purpose of sentencing. They were again – (the 2nd and 3rdcharges) for “failure to present for urine test”, under the above Regulation 15(3)(f).\n",

The deputy public prosecutor, Mr Muhammad Faizal, submitted that “the burden is incumbent on the defence to show (on) the balance of probabilities, Your Honour, that the accused was not wilfully blind as to the nature of the drug i.e. diamorphine”. He specified that the prosecution was not “(seeking) to prove actual knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt... We (therefore) do not propose to use the doctrine of wilful blindness to show that the accused had actual knowledge and we have not, in any event, discharged that burden. However, what we seek to rely on is, namely, this Section 18(2) presumption, together with using the doctrine of wilful blindness to show that the accused has not rebutted the Section 18(2) presumption, Your Honour, which is as to the non-existence of their knowledge”.

      " In the premises, I am satisfied that the accused had an agreement with Bapak not to deliver more than 250g of methamphetamine and, further, that he had no reason to suspect that this agreement was breached on the day of his arrest. I thus accept his defence that he knowingly possessed no more than 250g of methamphetamine at the material time. Accordingly, I amended his capital charge to one of possessing 249.99g of methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking and convicted him on this amended charge. As the accused was charged with trafficking in more than 250g of methamphetamine, he faced the mandatory death penalty if found guilty (see s 33 read with the Second Schedule of the MDA). However, at the end of the trial, I believed his defence that, even though he was caught carrying 386.7g of methamphetamine, he never intended to traffic in more than 250g of the same. Accordingly, I amended the above charge against the accused to one of having a lesser amount of 249.99g of methamphetamine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. I convicted the accused on this amended charge and sentenced him to 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. As the prosecution has since appealed against my decision to acquit the accused on the capital charge, I shall now set out my grounds for doing so. The prosecution’s case[note: 7] was straightforward given the facts. The prosecution submitted that since it was undisputed that the accused was in possession of the two plastic bags containing the drugs, he is presumed under s 18(1)(a) MDA to have had all of the drugs in his possession and further presumed under s 18(2) MDA to have known the nature of the drugs. These presumptions, it was argued, were not rebutted by the accused and thus all that remained to be established was whether the drugs were for the purpose of trafficking. The prosecution submitted that this latter point should be answered in the affirmative because the accused clearly admitted that he was on his way to deliver the drugs to Bapak’s contact at the time of his arrest. Accordingly, the total quantity of 386.7g of methamphetamine was in the accused’s possession for the purpose of trafficking and he should be convicted on the charge as framed.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, I find that the Prosecution has proven its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused’s allegations held no water and ultimately failed upon scrutiny. I, therefore, convict the accused for the offence of importation of 83.36 grammes of diamorphine into Singapore under s 7 of the Act. The accused, however, argues that he lacked the requisite mens rea for establishing the commission of the offence. His defence is that he had no knowledge of the six bundles wrapped in newspaper that were found stuffed in his motorcycle seat contained diamorphine. This is premised on his assertions that the six bundles of diamorphine were planted in his motorcycle seat by Kumar, Gobi or Alagendran without his knowledge. If the accused is able to prove on a balance of probabilities that he had no knowledge that the hidden bundles were diamorphine then he successfully rebuts the presumption of possession of the diamorphine: see Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor [2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“Nagaenthran”) at [25]. This would mean that the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drug under s 18(2) of the Act does not even arise since the element of possession required to give rise to the presumption is not established. The mens rea for importation of a controlled drug would consequently not be established and I would have to acquit the accused. The events on the night of 11 May 2011 concerning Kumar and Gobi as well as the hardness of the accused’s motorcycle seat are, as described above, highly suspicious. It must have occurred to the accused that illegal drug must have been hidden in his motorcycle seat and that he was being used as a courier for the loan of RM1,500. The accused made no attempts to check the seat of his motorcycle at all. He deliberately turned a blind eye towards the fact that Kumar or Gobi might have planted something in the motorcycle seat for him to transport into Singapore. Therefore, the accused was wilfully blind towards the presence of the diamorphine in the motorcycle seat. I find that such wilful blindness, premised on the accused’s failure to check despite the suspicious and surreptitious circumstances, is proven beyond a reasonable doubt based on the accused’s version of the events. Therefore, wilful blindness equates to actual knowledge. My finding that the accused was wilfully blind satisfies the mens rea requirement for establishing the offence of importation. This is then sufficient ground for convicting the accused since he does not dispute the actus reus element of the offence. Nonetheless, before I conclude, I shall also deal with the accused’s confessions during the course of the investigations.\n",

      " Although the accused has only appealed against the sentence, I was satisfied that the all the elements of the charge under s 7 of the Act had been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused was caught red-handed with the diamorphine and there was also evidence that he was aware that the drugs that he was to deliver was diamorphine or heroin. Accordingly, the actus reus and the mens rea for the offence were fulfilled. At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I explained the usual allocution to the accused. He elected to remain silent. I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the specified charge of importing 23.84 grams of diamorphine into Singapore. Accordingly, I found the accused guilty as charged. The court therefore has to decide whether to impose more than 15 strokes. I noticed that the accused had no criminal record. Although the evidence in court revealed that he had previously illegally imported drugs into Singapore without being caught, I did not take that into consideration as an antecedent as he was not convicted of that charge. I regarded the accused as a first-time offender. He was only 20 years old at the time he committed the offence. He was very young and he was also very co-operative. The net amount of diamorphine was also not very large, ie, 23.84 grams. Accordingly, I did not think it was necessary for me to impose more than the minimum of 15 strokes. The amount of diamorphine imported by the accused exceeded the statutory limit of 15 grams as prescribed under the Second Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). Hence this offence is punishable with death if the accused is convicted. The accused claimed trial to the said charge.\n",

      " On the evidence adduced by the prosecution, I was satisfied that a case against the accused was sufficiently made out for him to enter upon his defence. The accused elected to testify. His defence was that he had no knowledge that there were two black bundles in the console box, and therefore, there was no knowledge that he was driving a car with the 22.24g of diamorphine into Singapore. I am of the view that the accused have little room and imagination to present a more credible account of why he was driving a car with drugs to Singapore at 5am – when he was only required to start his shift as a petrol pump attendant at 3pm. The story as he presented was probably the best he could adduce in the circumstances. I therefore find that the evidence of the accused to be untrue and that the presumptions against him under ss 18(2) and 21 of the MDA have not been rebutted. Accordingly, I found him guilty as charged. The Deputy Public Prosecutor Mr Lim informed the court that the Public Prosecutor was not issuing a certificate of substantive cooperation under s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA to the accused. Thereafter, the accused’s lawyer Mr Kanagavijayan informed the court that he has no further submissions to make on behalf of the accused.

      " That being the case, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the accused and accordingly I found him guilty and convicted him of the charge of trafficking in 6.73 grams of diamorphine. Mohamed Elfee Bin Mohamed Yusof (the accused), male, aged 34, was convicted of 1 charge of trafficking in 6.73 grams of diamorphine , a Class A controlled drug, under section 5(1)(a) and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drug Act, (MDA)Chapter 185, after a trial. The accused was then sentenced to serve 9 years imprisonment with 8 strokes of the cane. He is now appealing against his conviction and sentence. In their address on sentence, the prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents. They submitted that in view of the weight of the diamorphine involved, the imprisonment term should be in the range of 8 years imprisonment. They highlighted the fact that this was not the accused’s first conviction of a drug trafficking charge, an utter lack of remorse on his part as he did not plead guilty and the absence of any significant mitigating factors. I note that all the precedent cases cited in the preceding paragraphs were cases where the accused persons there were first offenders in so far as trafficking charges were concerned, they had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and the amount they trafficked in were actually far lesser than the accused. In comparison to him, they had fewer aggravating factors, were less culpable and the accused’s sentence therefore should be higher. There were also no significant mitigating factors in this case. Nonetheless, I was prepared to accord some leniency to the accused, having regard to the fact that he had been in remand from 17th October, 2012 to 11th July, 2013, which is a period of almost 9 months, before he was released on bail. All considered, I sentenced the accused to serve 9 years imprisonment with 8 strokes of the cane.\n",

      " I was satisfied that the Accused had failed to rebut the presumptions. Other than a bare assertion that he was not in charge of the Car, and that both he and Alias had used the Car together, he did not lead evidence to support his assertion. Pertinently, he chose not to call Alias and, to a lesser extent, Julius to corroborate his story. However, the presumptions notwithstanding, the burden still rests with DPP Tan to prove her case beyond reasonable doubt. I would now set out the reasons why I found that she has. He then pleaded guilty to the following two charges - (i) one count of LT2 consumption of methamphetamine, an offence under section 8(b)(ii) punishable under section 33A(1) of the same Act, and (ii) one count of leaving Singapore without approval whilst under a supervision order, an offence under Regulation 15(3)(d) punishable under Regulation 15(6)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations. Two similar charges and one other charge of possession of utensils for drug taking, an offence under section 9 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. I have no hesitation in rejecting Mr Kumar’s case theory that because of the ‘inducement’ offered in the form of the reduced charge, and the ‘threat’ of Alias’s arrest, the Accused had then made up the contents in paragraph 3. Mr Kumar had treated ASP Seow’s revelation about his practice of informing his accused persons of the final HSA results with disbelief. His argument was that, if ASP Seow was truly so conscientious and had wanted to keep the Accused updated, he wondered why he not shown the results of the DNA analysis to the Accused. I found it rather hard to follow Mr Kumar’s logic here. I did not find ASP Seow’s action in informing the Accused of the reduction of the charge to a non-capital one incredulous or suspicious. I would go so far as to say that it would be an essential part of the investigative process. After all the Accused was entitled to know what charge he would ultimately be facing. And that the charge was now reduced to a non-capital one, it was not unusual for ASP Seow to record a further statement from him. Despite Mr Kumar’s vigorous attempts to paint it so, I was satisfied that ASP Seow’s visit to see the Accused was not part of an elaborate scheme to milk a confession from him. ASP Seow had stated three specific purposes for the visit. These were all cogent and credible reasons; not at all unusual in the context of the investigation then on-going. The fact that he had not shown the DNA analysis result to the Accused as well during the visit was neither here nor there. As cogently explained by ASP Seow, he had not shown the DNA result to the Accused because the result did not affect the charge. On the other hand, the HSA analysis had significantly affected the charge that the Accused would face. Perhaps Mr Kumar had confused the investigation process with the pre-trial discovery process. Informing the Accused that he would be facing a non-capital charge did not, in my mind, amount to an inducement to the Accused to make P10. Mr Kumar argued vehemently that the sudden about turn by his client in P10 must be viewed with suspicion in the backdrop of his prior consistent denials about his knowledge of C1A1 and C1B1 in the Car in all his statements prior to P10. This argument is obviously inaccurate. The evidence before me did not bear this out. Admittedly, the Accused had said that he did not know to whom the drugs C1A1 and C1B1 had belonged to in his statement in D1. However, in his statement P9, which was recorded six days after D1 was recorded, he did not make an outright denial of knowledge. Instead he gave a somewhat ambivalent statement as follows: “Regarding the 2 pounds of heroin marked as C1A1 and C1B1 in the blue plastic bag, I do not wish to comment on who the 2 pounds of heroin belonged to” (at paragraph 50 of P9). I found that DPP Tan has proven the case against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. The Accused had control and had used the Car. In the early hours of the morning of 6 Aug 13, he had driven the Car and had collected the bundle C1A1 and C1B1 containing heroin from a male Indian courier at the vicinity of Tuas. He had collected the bundle for a friend. He knew that the bundle contained heroin. The bundle was then placed under the front passenger seat of the Car. He also knew that another packet containing heroin was under the driver’s seat. This packet of heroin was his and was meant for use as test samples for his prospective clients.\n",

Having been convicted after trial, the accused is not entitled to the usual discount for an early plea of guilt and hence, show of remorse.

He has been remanded since 13 November 2013 as this was initially a capital charge and subsequently the Accused was unable to furnish bail.

He had also cast aspersions against the integrity of the CNB officers, insinuating that the statement ‘P11’ was fabricated and that SSgt Mohd Nabil was not an honest officer as he kept a separate pocket book. On the other hand, I also noted that the Accused was convicted on a single charge and this was his first trafficking offence. All things considered, I sentenced the Accused to 6 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane. I also ordered the sentence to run from 13.11.2013 when the Accused was remanded.

After having considered the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses and the respective written submissions from both the Prosecution and the Defence, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt in respect of the proceeded charge. Consequently, I rejected his defence as well as the assertion that the charge was bad and meaningless and that the Prosecution had totally failed to prove the alleged conspiracy to traffic a controlled drug beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the said charge. It was submitted that at the close of the entire case, the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the charge against the Accused. It was further submitted that in accordance with s 230(1)(w) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev. Ed), “if the court finds the accused not guilty, it must order a discharge amounting to an acquittal, and shall, provided there is no other charge pending against him, forthwith release the accused”. Simply put, if the prosecution is unable to prove its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court shall, provided there is no other charge pending against him, grant him an acquittal and release him immediately. The defence then went on to highlight the law on proving a case beyond a reasonable doubt as well as the law and elements for the offence of abetment by conspiracy in the present charge. It was the case for the defence that a careful, detailed analysis of PW1’s evidence amply demonstrates that his evidence was wholly tenuous, manifestly unreliable, inherently incredible and insufficient to prove an agreement between the Accused, PW1 and “an unknown person in Malaysia” to traffic in five packets containing 91.29 grams of methamphetamine, a Class A controlled drug, much less to prove that an act or illegal omission had taken place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing. Consequently, the prosecution had failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt every single element of the charge against the Accused to safely secure a conviction. It was the case for the defence that the prosecution bears the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the charge. It was submitted that the only witness called by the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the offence of abetment by conspiracy as alleged in the charge “C1A” against the Accused, was PW1 who in the circumstances of the case was an accomplice. It was further submitted that this entails the Court to adopt the correct approach in law with regards to the treatment of a sole witness who is an accomplice against an accused person.\n",

      " At the conclusion of the joint trial, I convicted the first and second accused persons of the respective charge against each of them. Further, I found that each of them had satisfied the requirements under s 33B(2) of the MDA. Instead of the death penalty provided for under s 33(1), pursuant to s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA, I imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on each of them, to commence on 23 February 2012 which is the date they were first charged in court. These are the reasons for my decision. I found that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt the charge against the first accused and that against the second accused, and convicted them accordingly. At the close of the prosecution’s case, there was evidence to show that on 21 February 2012, the first accused gave the luggage bag to the second accused, and the latter took it with her to the Woodlands Checkpoint. As the two accused persons were in actual possession of the luggage bag containing the methamphetamine, under s 18(1) of the MDA, they were presumed to be in possession of the methamphetamine contained in the luggage bag. In turn, under s 18(2) of the MDA, both the accused persons were presumed to have known the nature of the drugs contained in the bag. As such, I was satisfied that the prosecution has made out a prima facie case on the respective charge against the first accused and the second accused. I called for the defence.

      " The legislative amendments cannot have been enacted to create a staggered trial. There must be only one trial to dispose of all issues, and after that, an appeal to the Court of Appeal if a party wishes. The accused is not prejudiced by the amendments because the original procedure remains should he elect for it. That is, he is still at liberty to challenge the charge on the ground that he did not traffick the drugs. If he succeeds he will be acquitted. If he fails he will be sentenced with the mandatory death penalty. The legislative enactments now provide an accused the right to claim that although he trafficked in the drugs, he did so only as a courier. Should he succeed and the PP certifies that he has rendered substantive assistance to the CNB, he may not suffer death. The second option open to him is that he may elect to claim that although he committed the offence he did so when he was labouring under an abnormality of mind. If he succeeds, he will also be spared the death penalty. In all the circumstances stated above, the accused has to elect which his case is at the outset. He might make two final submissions together, namely, that he did not traffick but in the event that the court finds that he did, his role was merely that of a courier. But he cannot try out one defence after the other. Even an accused in a murder case has to elect from the start if he wishes to plead diminished responsibility. By the same token, the PP must indicate at the outset as well whether it will or will not be granting the certificate of substantive assistance. This will enable the accused to consider his defence carefully and make his election. It seems, therefore, that the legislative amendments did not alter the circumstances to the prejudice of the accused. In fact, they provide two opportunities, in limited circumstances, for the accused to save himself from the gallows with the aim of enhancing the overall operational effectiveness of our regime against drug trafficking. The answer to the first question is unequivocally set out in s 33B(2)(a) of the Act, namely, yes, the convicted person has to prove on a balance of probabilities that he was no more than a courier. The answer to the second question must be an obvious one, namely, yes. What was not asked was whether the court may permit an accused the opportunity of adducing further evidence after the trial. To this unasked question, Chao JA in his judgment was of the view that the convicted person ought to be granted leave to adduce further evidence. The majority decision by Woo Bih Li J and Tay Yong Kwang J, however, held that no further evidence ought to be allowed. In respect of the third question, the Court of Appeal held that the saving provisions apply to a convicted person only if the person satisfies the specific wording of ss 33B(2)(a)(i) to 33B(2)(a)(iv). ”Selling” or having an intention to sell, clearly cannot mean “transporting, sending, or delivering”. But this creates a separate issue concerning the burden of proof. The Act states that the accused bears the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that his role was restricted to “transporting, sending, or delivering” and the like. But the Act clearly does not compel the accused on his own, without more, to prove a negative. If the Prosecution has adduced evidence to show that the accused had the intention to sell, that shifts the evidential burden to the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that he had no such intention. Furthermore, evidence of the accused’s intention to sell may also be given to the court through other persons such as co-accused persons and other witnesses. The accused was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint on 15 January 2010 and charged for importing not less than 94.96g of diamorphine into Singapore. That is an offence under s 7 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). The accused claimed trial. The trial commenced on 8 May 2013 and the evidence concluded on 20 June 2013. On 5 August 2013 I found the accused guilty as charged.

She cannot then say that the presumptions of knowledge have been rebutted. She did nothing sufficient to rebut it. In response to the submission by Deputy Public Prosecutor Ma Hanfeng that the accused had been wilfully blind, Mr Ahmad Nizam submitted that “wilful blindness” is “merely ‘lawyer-speak’ for actual knowledge that is inferred from the circumstances of the case. It is an indirect way to prove actual knowledge; ie, actual knowledge is proved because the inference of knowledge is irresistible and is the only rational inference available on the facts ...” Counsel then argued that “where the prosecution seeks to rely on actual knowledge in the form of wilful blindness, the alleged wilful blindness must be proved beyond reasonable doubt”. For the reasons above, I find the accused guilty as charged and convict her accordingly.\n",

      " For the reasons given above, I find that the Prosecution has proved the respective charge against the first and second accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I find them guilty and convict them of the respective charge. I will proceed to the sentencing of the accused persons. Although the first and second accused had indicated to Insp Sim in their respective third long statements dated 13 February 2013 that they should be charged for trafficking in one bundle of drugs each, instead of both bundles of drugs, neither accused person challenged during trial or closing submissions that they were jointly in possession of both bundles of drugs at the time of their arrest. In fact, both the first and second accused accepted under cross-examination that they were both in possession of the two black bundles found in the haversack upon arrest. Both the first and second accused also accepted under cross-examination that at the time of their arrest, they were waiting for instructions regarding the delivery of the two bundles of drugs, and that if they had not been placed under arrest, they would have gone on to deliver the bundles as instructed (see [32] and [40]). These were also broadly their positions in their respective oral, contemporaneous, first and second long statements. Thus, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that both accused persons were in possession of the two bundles of drugs containing not less than 26.21g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking in furtherance of their common intention to do so. Thus, if the Prosecution seeks to show that an accused had actual knowledge, the Prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had actual knowledge of the nature of the drug in his or her possession. Alternatively, the Prosecution may also rely on the doctrine of wilful blindness. As has been stated in a number of judgments, wilful blindness is the legal equivalent of actual knowledge (see Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v PP [2014] 3 SLR 721 (“Muhammad Ridzuan”) at [76]). In Nagaenthran, the Court of Appeal explained the concept of wilful blindness (at [30]): Therefore, if wilful blindness has been proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, the Prosecution need not rely on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA.\n",

      " The absence of a common purpose of the meeting between the two accused persons is a strong indictment in itself in the circumstances, but their respective versions, already weakened by their mutual contradictions, do not make sense even on their own. I am thus satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that both accused knew that the black plastic bags contained diamorphine and they acted with the common intention of trafficking in them in the manner of the second accused dropping part of them off at Block 405 Pandan Gardens.

On the evidence adduced above, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case against both accused as charged.

      " In Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh [1993] 3 SLR(R) 302, the accused was charged for abetment in conspiring to traffic drugs. His defence was that he was an innocent bailee of the drugs and did not know what was inside the two plastic bags that were found in the boot of his car. Despite finding that the accused was not a “good witness”, the trial judge held that the accused had successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA and acquitted him. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and convicted the accused. According to the Court of Appeal, the lies of the accused were a deliberate attempt on his part to dissociate himself from his conspirators as well as to maintain ignorance of the drugs in his car, and rejected his explanation for the lies as being incredible (at [34]). The essence of the appeal, as the Court noted, was whether the trial judge was correct to decide that the accused was a credible witness and therefore successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge (at [43]). In this regard, the Court disagreed with the decision of the trial judge and stated that (at [44]–[45]): Both Hamidah and Ilechukwu claimed trial.

      " After ensuring that the accused persons understood the nature and consequences of their plea of guilt and the sentences prescribed for the offences, I found them guilty as charged and convicted them accordingly. The first accused was a female offender and therefore was not liable to be caned (see s 325(1)(a) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”)). As such, the first accused faced imprisonment for a term of not less than 20 years, five years and three years for the first to third charges respectively. On top of these charges, the first accused consented for the remaining two charges to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“the TIC charges”). The TIC charges pertained to the following offences:\n",
      "(a)     Fourth charge: Possession of utensils intended to be used for consuming a controlled drug – s 9 of the MDA.\n",
      "(b)     Fifth charge: Possession of methamphetamine – s 8(a) of the MDA. Having regard to all of the above, I sentenced her to 20 years’ imprisonment for the first charge of trafficking 14.99 grams of diamorphine, 6 years’ imprisonment for the second charge of trafficking 68.51 grams of methamphetamine and 3 years’ imprisonment for the third charge of enhanced consumption. I ordered the sentences for the third charge to run consecutively with that for the first charge and the sentence for the second charge to run concurrently with that for the first charge. The total sentence would therefore be 23 years’ imprisonment. The sentences were also backdated to 6 May 2011, the date of her arrest. The first accused’s urine samples were found to contain methamphetamine and this formed the subject of the third charge against her. She admitted that she had consumed methamphetamine prior to her arrest on 6 May 2011. She would consume methamphetamine about three to four times a week. She would heat up the methamphetamine, let the smoke pass through a glass container containing some water and inhale the smoke thereafter.

      " The accused claimed that he had relied on the assurances of Jagen (who he said was a close friend) that the drugs had low drug content and that he would face a light sentence if he was caught. Accordingly, he did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that the plastic bags he was carrying contained diamorphine. To this end, the defence relied on the Court of Appeal decision in Khor Soon Lee [2011] 3 SLR 201 (“Khor Soon Lee”). There, the appellant appealed against his conviction on the charge of importing 27.8g of diamorphine into Singapore. The appellant, on the instructions of one Tony, had brought in various types of drugs like Ketamine and Ecstasy to Singapore. However, the appellant did not know the contents of the fourth bundle and thought it to be “ice”. The Court of Appeal, in allowing the appeal, considered that:\n",
      "(a)     the appellant had consistently imported drugs which would not attract a death sentence;\n",
      "(b)     he had been careful to confirm with Tony that the packages contained only controlled drugs and not diamorphine;\n",
      "(c)     he trusted Tony because of a close and personal relationship; and\n",
      "(d)     accordingly, he did not have a strong suspicion to which he turned a blind eye; at most, his failure to check the nature of the drugs amounted to negligence or recklessness but that was not enough to establish wilful blindness. A second charge of drug trafficking was stood down and subsequently withdrawn after I convicted and sentenced the accused on the first charge.[note: 1] Section 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) provides that any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. This applies to the accused in two ways: first, by virtue of s 18(1)(a) of the MDA, as he was arrested with the drugs in the plastic bags that he was carrying and second, by virtue of s 21 of the MDA, as the accused was in charge of the Prime Mover at the material time. To rebut the presumption of knowledge in the context of s 18(2) of the MDA, the accused must prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known that the thing in his possession contained that controlled drug (Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public Prosecutor [2012] 2 SLR 903 at [21]). No facts were given and no submissions were made to justify the imposition of the ultimate punishment of the death penalty on the accused. The accused was born on 14 September 1968 and is now 46 years old. He therefore does not fall within s 325(1)(b) of the CPC which provides that men who are more than 50 years of age (at the time of infliction of the caning) shall not be punished with caning. The only submission on sentence made by his counsel after the conviction was that the minimum number of strokes should be imposed as the accused was already 46 years old. Accordingly, I sentenced him to life imprisonment (to commence from 22 April 2013, his date of arrest) and 15 strokes of the cane, the minimum sentence provided by law.\n",

      " In conclusion, the court find that the prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had intended to sell the drugs found in his possession to Ah Boi. This is shown in the evidence of the Agreed Statement of Facts, the positive statement given by the accused (P36) and the statement P39 given by Ah Boi (DW2 Chua Boon Thiam) as well as the text messages which were tendered in court (P38 A to P38C). The 3 packets seized from the accused containing a total of no less than 20.7 grams of crystalline substance during the time of his arrest were sent to the HSA for an analysis and the results confirmed that the 3 packets contained no less than 13.99 grams of methamphetamine. The accused has not rebutted the presumption that the possession of methamphetamine was for the purpose of trafficking to be sold to “Ah Boi”.In the circumstances, the court found the accused guilty of the trafficking charge and convicted him accordingly. The accused is facing an enhanced charge of trafficking in a controlled drug under section 5(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185 – “MDA”). The accused claimed trial to the charge and at the end of the trial, he was found guilty and convicted accordingly. He was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 10 years imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. As the accused was facing 4 other charges which were stood down pending trial, the prosecution tendered the additional 4 charges at the end of the trial. The 4 charges consist of consumption, trafficking and possession of drug utensils. The prosecution proceeded on 2 of the 4 additional charges with the remaining 2 charges taken into consideration. The 2 additional charges proceeded with are for consumption and possession of drug utensils. The accused pleaded guilty to the 2 charges and was sentenced to 7 years and 6 strokes for the consumption charge and 6 months imprisonment for the possession of drug utensils. The court ordered the sentence of 6 months imprisonment for the possession of drug utensils charge to run consecutively with the sentence of 10 years and 10 strokes for the trafficking charge referred to in para.1 which was dealt with during the trial. The total sentence imposed by the court is 10 years 6 months and 16 strokes of the cane. The accused is appealing against the conviction only. The court is satisfied that when the statement P36 was recorded by PW1 from the accused, no one else was inside the interview room other than the recording officer, PW1 and the accused. PW1 and PW2 had confirmed that there was no one else inside the interview room during the recording of the statement other than the accused and PW1. PW1 and PW2 had also confirmed that there was no such officer who had threatened the accused when he was waiting at the benches as officers are not allowed to speak to the accused persons who are waiting at the benches unless the accused persons require medical assistance or is unruly. There is therefore no possibility that there is a CNB officer who was able to threaten the accused before or during the recording of the statement by PW1. The court finds that the statement P36 was recorded voluntarily. The court also noted that there is no recording in the Movement Register (P29) and the Station Diary (P30) of any complaints by the accused that he was threatened by a CNB officer into admitting that he was trafficking in drugs.\n",

After all, the drugs in question were found in her flat and she did testify that she would sometimes help the accused to repack drugs. In a situation where an accomplice is testifying for the prosecution, the court has to scrutinise her evidence carefully to consider whether she has any reason or motive to inculpate the accused. Notwithstanding that she has pleaded guilty to certain charges and has already been sentenced, it was important to bear in mind that her charges did not relate to the drugs in question that were found in her flat. Therefore, it would still be in her interest to see that the accused be convicted of trafficking in the drugs in question. For that reason, I had to approach and consider her evidence carefully. The accused was unrepresented. He claimed trial to a charge of drug-trafficking (“drug-trafficking charge”). Twenty-eight (28) other drug-related charges were stood down. At the conclusion of the trial and after considering all the evidence and submissions, the accused was acquitted of the drug-trafficking charge. The prosecution appealed against the order of acquittal. On the day that I acquitted the accused, I had provided to the learned DPP written grounds for my decision to acquit the accused. Even though I had referred to it as my “brief grounds”, the written grounds were in fact sufficiently substantive. I will therefore reproduce them here as my full grounds without adding more, save for editorial amendments.\n",

      " I was satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that prosecution had proven the charge against the Accused and I convicted him as charged. I convicted the Accused, after trial, of trafficking in 2 packets of crystalline substance which were found to contain not less than 2.36 grams of methamphetamine, a Class ‘A’ controlled drug, being an offence under section 5(2) and punishable under section 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”), Cap 185. He then pleaded guilty to 4 other drug related charges and I sentenced him as follows: This statement comprised of paragraphs 1 to 11. According to the Accused, only paragraph 10 (see preceding paragraph 19) was false. He declared that paragraph 10 was a mixture of accurate and inaccurate sentences as he fabricated some answers. He said he was very afraid because Sgt Muhammad Azri kept asking him the same questions – i.e. whom he (Accused) gave drugs to. That was why he gave the names Sham, Babylon and Ayub. Contrary to Accused’s account, only one name “Sham” was recorded in ‘P17’. It was in the second statement ‘P18’ that the 3 names - Sham, Babylon and Ayub were disclosed. The Accused had no explanation for this anomaly but merely insisted that he revealed all 3 names to Sgt Muhammad Azri. This cannot be true as the 3 names would have appeared in ‘P17’. There was no reason for Sgt Muhammad Azri to omit recording the other 2 names ‘Babylon’ and ‘Ayub’. The Court of Appeal in Lim Thian Lai v PP [2006]1SLR(R )319 cited that Mohamed Bacha Miah and another v PP [1992]2 SLR(R)783 established that an accused person may be convicted on his own confession even when it is retracted, if the court is satisfied of its truth.

      " As observed in Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP [1998] SGCA 64, “the test of voluntariness is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise, and the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge: Dato Mokhtar bin Hashim v PP [1983] 2 MLJ 232 and Md Desa bin Hashim v PP [1995] 3 MLJ 350. It is also established that where voluntariness is challenged, the burden is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was made voluntarily and not for the Defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the confession was not made voluntarily: Koh Aik Siew v PP [1993] 1 SLR(R) 885. However, the accused need only raise a reasonable doubt or, in other words, it is only necessary for the Prosecution to remove a reasonable doubt of the existence of the threat, inducement or promise, and not every lurking shadow of influence or remnants of fear: Panya Martmontree v PP [1995] 2 SLR(R) 806 at [32] and: See Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP [1998] SGCA 64 at [53]. Having regard to all the circumstances, I find that a reasonable person in the shoes of the accused would have serious suspicions about the nature of the drug which he was being asked to deliver, and would have taken steps to inquire further. Instead, the accused remained oblivious to the nature of the drug and made no attempts to examine the bundles which were in his possession for some 6 hours. In his own words he chose ‘not to analyse too deep’ (NE Day3 pg 35). Coupled with the finding that his oral testimony was unreliable, I find that the accused has not proved on a balance of probabilities that he could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the drugs. The accused has thus failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. On the evidence adduced. I found that the prosecution had proved the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly I found the accused guilty and convicted him. At the close of the prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven that there was some evidence that was not inherently incredible to establish all the elements of the charge against the accused. Accordingly the court explained to the accused the allocution as stated in Section 230(m) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The accused elected to give his defence from the witness box. The primary issue at trial was whether there was sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption under Section 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap. 185 (2008 Rev. Ed.) (“MDA”) that the accused knew the nature of the drugs which were in his possession. At the conclusion of the trial, he was found guilty and convicted on the charge. A sentence of 20 years 3 months imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane was imposed. On 2 February 2016, the accused filed a notice of appeal against conviction and sentence.\n",

      " In conclusion, for all the reasons as stated in the preceding paragraphs, especially Puvan’s evidence and the call records, P11, I was satisfied that the accused was a part of the conspiracy to import the drugs, into Singapore and that on the 23rd of April, 2014 he was present to receive the drugs from Puvan, who acted as a courier by collecting them from Dani and bringing them into Singapore. The accused, Puvan and Dani knew the respective roles they had to play in the conspiracy to bring the diamorphine into Singapore. I therefore concluded that the prosecution had proven its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and found him guilty and convicted him on the charge of abetting by engaging in a conspiracy with Puvan, PW5 and a male Malaysian known as Dani to import drugs and pursuant to that conspiracy, Puvan did import into Singapore on the 23rd of April, 2014 at about 6 am not less than 14.99 grams of diamporphine, a Class A controlled drug which is an offence under the MDA. I am aware that Dani’s name is stated as ‘Deni’ in the charge but this is not fatal as Puvan spelt his name as ‘Dani’. I agreed with the prosecution. At this juncture, the threshold whether or not to call for the defence is not very high. The trial judge is obliged to keep an open mind about the veracity of witnesses and merely assess whether there exists evidence, not inherently incredible, that would support the charge. Based on the phone records as reflected in P11 and Puvan’s evidence there was obviously a connection among Dani, Puvan and the accused which cannot be dismissed as a mere coincidence. I was satisfied therefore that the prosecution had established a prima facie case against the accused. After administering the standard allocution, I invited the accused to enter his defence to the charge. The accused elected to give his defence. The accused person, namely Toh Eng Puey, a 84 year old male, was convicted, after a trial, of 1 charge of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy to import not less than 14.99 grams of diamporphine, a class A controlled drug, into Singapore, which is an offence under Section 7 read with Section 12 punishable under Section 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), Chapter 185. The brief details of the charge are as follows:\n",

Based on the events from the time of his arrest to the search at the Flat as well as the accused’s own statements, I found that there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had possession and knowledge. The accused had in his custody the keys to the Flat in which the drugs were found, raising the presumption of possession under s 18(1)(c) of the MDA. In any event, the accused had also admitted that the drugs belonged to him and that he was the one who had left them in his niece’s bedroom. Similarly, there was clear evidence of knowledge. The accused readily identified the contents of the bundles as “ubat” at the time the Flat was searched, and he had seen the contents of the bundles himself.

      " At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved the charge beyond a reasonable doubt against the accused. I found him guilty and convicted him of the charge. By s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) read with its Second Schedule, the punishment prescribed for the charge is death. Section 33B(1)(a) provides that in prescribed circumstances, the court has a discretion not to impose the death penalty. However, the accused did not satisfy s 33B(2)(b) as the Public Prosecutor did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance. As the alternative sentencing option could not be considered, the sentence of death was imposed. I now provide my reasons for my decision. In their written submissions, the Prosecution argued that it was not seriously disputed that the accused was in possession of the drugs, and that he was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of delivering the drugs to someone, ie, for the purpose of trafficking. Therefore, the first and third elements had clearly been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In any event, the Prosecution would rely on the presumption within s 18(1) of the MDA to prove possession of the drugs, which has not been rebutted by the accused. The real contention centred on the mens rea of the charge. Relying on the statements made upon arrest that he knew that the black bag contained heroin, the Prosecution contended that the accused knew the nature of the drugs. Alternatively, the Prosecution relied on the presumption within s 18(2) of the MDA that the accused knew of the nature of the drugs. Given the facts and circumstances of the case, the Prosecution then submitted that the accused had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the drugs on a balance of probabilities. Taking into account the matters in [90] – [93], the accused had not proved, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known, the nature of the drug found in his possession so as to rebut the presumption of knowledge. The mere assertion of lack of knowledge did not suffice. The Prosecution had proved the charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted him of the charge. The law concerning voluntariness of an accused’s statements is well settled, and not contested by the parties. To constitute a threat, inducement or promise rendering a statement involuntary, there must objectively be a threat, inducement or promise, and this must subjectively operate on the mind of the particular accused: Abdul Malik bin Abdul Jamil v PP [2002] 1 SLR(R) 591 at [17]; Public Prosecutor v Ng Pen Tine and another [2009] SGHC 230 at [18]. In respect of an allegation of drug withdrawal, the relevant test is that to render a statement involuntary, an accused must be in a state of near delirium, such that his mind did not go with the statements he was making: Garnam Singh v Public Prosecutor [1994] 1 SLR(R) 1044 at [31]. The burden falls on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a statement has been made voluntarily.\n",

      " At the conclusion of the joint trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved both charges beyond a reasonable doubt. I convicted Ranjit and Farid of the respective charge against each of them. Under s 33(1) of the MDA, the punishment prescribed for the charges is death. However, s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA gives the court a discretion to impose the alternative sentence of life imprisonment and a minimum of 15 strokes of the cane provided the conditions under ss 33B(2)(a) and 33B(2)(b) of the MDA are met. Farid admitted every element of the offence with which he was charged. He sought merely to show that he had co-operated with CNB and given valuable information. In his various statements to CNB, he consistently and candidly admitted that the Robinsons bag was in his possession, that he knew it contained heroin, and that his purpose in receiving the heroin was to distribute it. He confirmed the accuracy of his statements in evidence-in-chief and cross-examination, except that he said that he had “assumed” that the Robinsons bag contained heroin because the two previous consignments he had received contained heroin. It was clear to me that Farid had actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs; in any event, it was plain that he had not rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA which arose against him. I therefore convicted Farid of the offence as charged. I noted Mr Singh’s argument that even if Farid’s role with regard to the offence charged involved repacking, such repacking was merely incidental to his role as a courier. However, Mr Singh did not (and could not) dispute that a person who does acts which are “not a necessary element of moving an object from one point to another” goes beyond playing the role of a courier: PP v Chum Tat Suan [2015] 1 SLR 834 at [68]. Thus, although a person who repacks drugs because such repacking is necessary to transport the drugs may still be a courier, “someone who packs drugs into bundles as a routine after ensuring that the right type and quantity of the drugs go into the right packaging” – in other words, someone like Farid – would certainly not be: PP v Yogaras Poongavanam [2015] SGHC 193 at [28]. This distinction explained the outcome in PP v Siva a/l Sannasi [2015] SGHC 73, which Mr Singh relied on. That case concerned an accused who had wrapped already packaged drugs in newspaper secured with rubber bands for transportation purposes. In contrast, Farid’s role to weigh and repack the drugs (into half-pound packages or smaller packets of 7.7–7.9g as required) was essentially a matter of convenience for facilitating distribution or sale; it was not necessary for or incidental to enabling the drugs to be transported. I was therefore unable to accept Mr Singh’s submission that Farid’s repacking was the act of a mere courier. Finally, there was significant dispute over whether Farid was an independent actor or was merely carrying out the instructions of another, ie, “Abang”, whom Farid alleged to be Ranjit. As I stated at [50] above, I was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that “Abang” was Ranjit. Even on the lower standard of proof on a balance of probabilities which Farid had to meet, it was still unclear to me whether “Abang” was Ranjit. Ultimately, nothing turned on this point. Even if Farid was acting on the instructions of “Abang” (who may or may not have been Ranjit), the fact that his role with regard to the offence charged would have included non-incidental repacking was sufficient to show that he was not a mere courier. It did not matter whether he was working independently or not.\n",

      " I found that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that the elements of both charges were made out. The weight of the evidence led by the Prosecution was overwhelmingly against the accused. In respect of the capital charge, it was the Prosecution’s case that it had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had in his possession the 193 packets of controlled drugs recovered from the Flat, which were subsequently analysed and found to contain not less than 34.94 grams of diamorphine. I found the accused guilty of both charges and convicted him accordingly. For the non-capital charge, I sentenced the accused to six years’ imprisonment with effect from the date of his remand on 9 October 2010. For the capital charge, the Prosecution informed the court that the Public Prosecutor would not be issuing a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA, and I imposed the mandatory death penalty on the accused accordingly. On the other hand, I found that the other four lies put forth by the Prosecution were deliberate, relating to material issues regarding either the accused’s case or the elements of the drug charges, and shown to be false by independent evidence. The accused’s movements on the day of his arrest were confirmed by the testimony of the tow truck driver (see above at [42(b)]); DNA evidence was found on the items recovered from the luggage bag in the Flat (see above at [42(c)]); the maid had testified that she did not find a discarded face mask in the Flat (see above at [42(d)]); and the maid also testified that she was never threatened by anyone with bodily harm before she left Singapore (see above at [42(e)]). I was of the view that these lies were deliberately told by the accused and motivated by the accused’s desire to distance himself from the drugs found and to establish his “theories” that he was framed. The lies were not made for innocent reasons. The accused’s endeavour to distance himself as far as possible from the drug exhibits indisputably found in his car and Flat was exaggerated to the extent they were shown to be incredible and to be lies. As the Court of Appeal put it in Ilechukwu at [61], there was “no acceptable explanation for the lies save for his realisation of his guilt”. Thus, apart from the finding that the accused was not creditworthy, the accused’s Lucas lies also amounted to corroboration of evidence of guilt.\n",

      " Having considered the evidence and the submissions of counsel, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proven the respective charges against Vejiyan and Razak beyond reasonable doubt. I thus find both Vejiyan and Razak guilty as charged and convict them accordingly. Although I have some suspicion that Saleh may be a co-conspirator together with Razak, it is not the function of this court to determine the guilt of Saleh, who is not on trial here. My present duty is to establish whether or not Razak is guilty. Counsel for Razak submitted that the guilt of Razak relies almost exclusively upon Razak’s word against that of Saleh, and that if the Prosecution fails to establish that Saleh’s version of events is the truth, then Razak must be acquitted. I am not so persuaded. I have already stated (at [23] – [24] above) that even without Saleh’s testimony, the objective circumstantial evidence that is before this court sufficiently proves Razak’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It may be that Razak alone had conspired together with Vejiyan and “Sasi” to traffic drugs, or Saleh might had been in it together with Razak, Vejiyan and “Sasi”. Either way, I am convinced, beyond reasonable doubt, that Razak is a party to the conspiracy. In Quek Hock Lye v Public Prosecutor [2012] 2 SLR 1012 (“Quek Hock Lye”), the Court of Appeal held (at 37]) that in order to secure a conviction for criminal conspiracy, it is sufficient for the Prosecution to prove that there are two or more persons who are guilty of conspiracy, even though the other person(s) involved may still be at large, dead, unknown, or for some reason acquitted on a technical ground. It was unnecessary that the co-conspirator(s) be tried and/or convicted: see Quek Hock Lye at [38], citing Pradumna Shriniwas Auradkar v State of Maharashtra 1981 Cri L J 1873. The same principle applies with respect to the present offence of abetment by conspiracy. I therefore find that that the Prosecution has proven its case against Vejiyan beyond reasonable doubt. However, I also find that Vejiyan’s role in the transaction was limited to that of a courier, that is, his involvement in the offence under s 7 of the MDA was restricted to the activities listed in s 33B(2)(a) and duplicated in s 33B(3)(a) of the Act, namely transporting, sending or delivering drugs and/or offering to transport, send or deliver drugs and/or doing or offering to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of transporting, sending or delivering drugs. There is no evidence showing that he did more than that. Counsel for Razak pointed out that there is no direct evidence that Razak had conspired with Vejiyan and “Sasi” to traffic drugs. This may be so. The nature of conspiracy is agreement, and in most cases, the actual agreement will take place in private in such circumstances that direct evidence of it will rarely be available (Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh [1993] 1 SLR(R) 302 (“Yeo Choon Poh”) at [19]). Hence, the existence of a conspiracy can be proved by circumstantial evidence, as well as the conduct of the parties both before and after the alleged commission of the offence, such as where the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand: see Yeo Choon Poh at [20] and also Nomura Taiji v Public Prosecutor [1998] 1 SLR(R) 259 (“Nomura Taiji”) at [106]). The evidence before me is that following “Sasi’s” instructions, Vejiyan was to deliver drugs to the intended recipient with the mobile phone number “[XXX]”. This number was traced to “RBD-HP”. On “Sasi’s instructions, Vejiyan made calls to “[XXX]”, and made arrangements with the person at the other end of the line to meet at Woodlands. Razak, together with Saleh, then turned up at the agreed meeting location in the red KIA and there, Razak opened the rear door of the red KIA to initiate contact with PW44 who was posing as Vejiyan. When Razak was arrested subsequently, “RBD-HP” was found in his possession. I am satisfied, after considering the evidence, that the Prosecution has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was an agreement between Razak, Vejiyan and “Sasi” to traffic drugs.\n",

      " In conclusion, I found that the Accused has not been able to prove on a balance of probability that he did not know that the items seized from his hiding place under his underwear were heroin. I also found that prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt that one of the items was for the purpose of trafficking as the Accused had intended to sell it to Ismail. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted of both the charges of trafficking and possession. As such, even though, the Accused has also filed an appeal against the sentence, it would not be necessary for me to provide any reasons for the sentence. I have already meted the shortest possible sentences allowed by law and thus the overall sentence clearly could not be said to be manifestly excessive. Accordingly, I will only set out my reasons for convicting the Accused on the 3 charges. Accordingly, I found that the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement had been made voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise. I am further reinforced in my finding when the Accused tendered his further statement D1 which had made reference to this oral statement P8. In D1 the Accused had raised the “epam” defence. He was then asked why he had stated in P8 that the 2 packets of heroin seized from him were for his consumption and for sale. He claimed that he had initially denied that the heroin belonged to him but when the officers did not believe him and kept asking him about them, he “gave up” and decided out of frustration to just tell the officer what he thought he wanted to hear. There was no allegation that he was fearful of violence being inflicted on him which had been inflicted earlier or that there was an inducement over not conducting a raid on his home. Neither did he protest that he did not make such an admission to SSgt Fareed and that P8 was a total fabrication of his statement. These allegations are therefore clearly an afterthought. I therefore found that it has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that P8 was voluntarily made and further that the contents had been accurately recorded. I also found that full weight can be given to the Accused’s admission of being in possession of the 2 heroin packets for his own consumption and for the purpose of trafficking.\n",

The following drug trafficking charge was taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing: It is undeniable that the offence of drug trafficking is a serious one which carries a minimum mandatory imprisonment term of five years and five strokes of the cane, and up to a maximum imprisonment term of 20 years and 15 strokes of the cane. Similarly for consumption of a specified drug, namely, cannabis where the punishment prescribed is imprisonment up to 10 years or fine up to $20,000 or both. It is clear that harsh sentences of imprisonment terms and caning would be meted out for adult offenders facing similar charges as the accused. The prosecution submitted for reformative training in view of deterrence which would be a relevant sentencing consideration for drug trafficking offences. Further, the accused had every opportunity to be candid with the PO in revealing the extent of his drug habits during the initial social investigations when the probation suitability report was called for, in particular, the details of the number of drug suppliers, the frequency he purchased drugs as well as the peers whom he associated with in engaging in such illegal activities. However, the accused chose not to do so until he finally admitted to the PO of the same (when the third supplementary report was prepared), after he was confronted specifically on whether he had sold drugs to “Bryant” prior to his arrest. In that regard, the prosecution submitted that since probation was no longer suitable for reasons highlighted above in the PO’s third supplementary report, reformative training would thus be the more appropriate sentence. It is undisputed that the accused’s offences of drug trafficking and consumption were undoubtedly serious. Deterrence was therefore the pertinent sentencing consideration in determining the appropriate sentence for the accused. The crux of the issue is whether the accused’s capacity for rehabilitation was ‘demonstrably high’ based on the factors as highlighted in paragraph 18 above, so as to displace the public policy concerns that militated against probation. I note the accused’s disclosure of the details of his drug history and habits, as well as peers whom he had engaged in such illegal activities, at such a late stage following which a third supplementary report was prepared. This was specifically in relation to whether the accused had sold drugs to “Bryant” prior to his arrest where the accused had denied the same notwithstanding his admission to the police in his statement. However, he had subsequently admitted to the PO that he had bought the drugs on “Bryant’s” behalf and passed it to him on a non-profit basis as “Bryant” was busy in school and unable to purchase the drugs directly from the supplier. This explanation was not forthcoming from the accused until the defence was informed that “Bryant” had indeed given a police statement stating that he had purchased the drugs from the accused for $50. In fact, the accused had revealed subsequently to the PO that the reason for his denial that he had previously sold drugs to “Bryant” was because he did not want to get “Bryant” into trouble. In light of the above, I therefore had doubts on whether the accused would be trustworthy in disclosing information in future should the accused be placed on probation, especially in relation to information which the PO is unable to verify.\n",

      " On the totality of the evidence, I was of the view that it would be unsafe to rely on the evidence of Khalid and Masnawi, and in particular their out of court statements, which did not stand up to scrutiny. I found that the prosecution did not discharge its burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt and acquitted the accused of the charges he faced. The accused was acquitted of the charges. The prosecution has filed an appeal. Khalid made various claims about the circumstances under which the statements were recorded: He was high on drugs. CNB suggested that the accused sold him drugs. He was not young and feared being sentenced for a long time. He was afraid of caning. He was unwell. He was forced to sign. He was told that if he refused to co-operate, CNB would bring him to court and he could face an “LT” charge. He did not understand the statements.[note: 16] These discrepancies were material and counted against the reliability of the statements. Since the accused denied selling drugs, how Khalid allegedly found out he was doing so was material. The fact that Khalid was not able to maintain a consistent account of events, especially whether he saw the accused selling drugs, affected the credibility of his allegations. How and when the alleged drug sale was performed was also similarly material. The charge stated that the drugs were purchased “on 23 July 2015”. This was based on Khalid’s second statement, but the third statement contradicted this date. Since both statements were tendered as evidence of the truth, it was incumbent on the prosecution to resolve this discrepancy and prove the date on which the transaction occurred, but no explanation was offered on this. The dates were material and could have an impact on the possible defences the accused could raise. Overall, I was of the view that the discrepancies and inconsistencies in the accounts contained in the statements raised serious issues on the reliability of the statements.\n",

      " First, it was their submission that the element of ‘abetment by engaging in a conspiracy’ with Fanyu was not made out. It was a simple request by Liew to Fanyu to get him a brick of marijuana. There was no common objective between the two of them to traffic in the drugs. Liew did not even know that Fanyu intended to go to Malaysia to get the brick of marijuana. In fact Fanyu was charged and convicted for drug importation and not drug trafficking. The arrangement between Liew and Fanyu was a simple ‘sale-by-Fanyu-and-purchase-by-Liew’. Having considered the totality of the evidence, I found that there was an agreement between Liew and Fanyu for Fanyu to traffic in the drugs ie to deliver the drugs to Liew. In pursuance of this conspiracy, Fanyu had imported drugs which he intended to deliver to Liew. The offence of abetment by conspiracy to traffic is therefore made out. I found Liew guilty and convicted him on the two proceeded charges. Liew was charged with two counts of engaging in a conspiracy with Fanyu to traffic in the Class A controlled drug, cannabis. He claimed trial to these two charges. Liew was also charged with consumption of a specified drug, 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, a cannabinol derivative and for possession of utensils intended for the consumption of a Class A controlled drug. These two charges were stood down at the start of the trial. At the close of the trial, I found Liew guilty and convicted him on the two drug trafficking charges. Liew then pleaded guilty to the consumption charge and consented to have the fourth charge taken into consideration. Liew was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane for each of the two drug trafficking charges and six months’ imprisonment for the consumption charge. The sentences in one drug trafficking charge and one consumption charge were ordered to run consecutively. The remaining sentences were ordered to run concurrently. The total sentence was 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. Liew has appealed against the conviction for the two trafficking charges. However, I had no such reservations about his second statement. It was recorded a full three days after his arrest when he claims to have smoked marijuana. By his own evidence the feeling of being high would only last for about two days. I was satisfied that the statement had been proved and therefore admissible in evidence under section 147(3).\n",

      " On 12 May 2017, I acquitted the accused on the two conspiracy charges of trafficking. I was satisfied that on the proved facts, lesser charges of attempted possession under ss 8(a) and 12 of the MDA were established beyond a reasonable doubt, and I framed the following charges under by hand: In conclusion, the accused was a heavy user of cannabis. He is a man of means and could afford to buy it. There is no evidence to contradict the accused’s account that the purchase was solely for his consumption or which makes his evidence unreliable. Accordingly, I found the two charges of trafficking had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. On the evidence of Ismail and also of the accused, I found that a clear case of attempted possession had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. As such, I substituted the charges with that under s 8(a) r/w s 12 and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA and framed the two charges under my hand. The accused pleaded guilty to these amended charges and he was accordingly convicted. The second step was to assess the purpose of the possession and to determine if there was a latent risk of the drugs falling in the hands of others. The accused stated that the drugs were for his own personal use. I accepted that as genuine. This was the reason why he was acquitted on the trafficking charges. The accused is a man of means. He did not have to sell drugs to support his addiction. However, from the WhatsApp messages exchanged with one Gwen Toh and Charmaine Harn, there was a latent risk of him obliging his friends who ran into difficulty in obtaining their own supply. However, on the uncontradicted evidence of the accused, their requests were eventually not fulfilled. Further, from the i-phone of the accused which was seized, only these messages between 28 to 30 October 2014 with the two individuals were surfaced by the prosecution. I therefore assessed the latent risk of the drugs ending up in the hands of others to be low. Accordingly, I did not enhance the starting points which I adopted. As there was a risk, albeit a low one, I also did not find it appropriate to go below the starting points. The amended charges were read to the accused and he elected to plead guilty to both charges. After his conviction, the matter was adjourned for the parties to address me on sentence. On 12 July 2017, after considering the prosecution’s submissions on sentence and the defence’s mitigation plea and submissions, I sentenced the accused to 16 months’ imprisonment on DAC-916820-2015 and two years’ imprisonment on DAC-916821-2015.

      " The accused person was dissatisfied with the conviction on the charge of trafficking and has since filed an appeal. No appeal against sentence was filed. I now set out the reasons for my decision to convict him of that charge. For all the foregoing reasons, I found that the prosecution had proven the trafficking charge against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt and I accordingly convicted him. At the time he gave evidence during the trial, Kenny had already completed serving sentence in relation to the drug offences which he was convicted of. When he gave evidence in court, he said that he had purchased the packet of ketamine from an unknown Malay male somewhere in Geylang. He claimed that he did not know who the accused person was and had no prior dealings with him. The prosecution then applied to cross-examine Kenny on his previous inconsistent statements, with a view to substituting his evidence in court with the contents therein. Having gone through the statements, I was satisfied that there were material inconsistencies between the statements and his testimony in court, and therefore allowed the application. At the conclusion of the trial, he was convicted. He indicated that he wished to plead guilty to the remaining four charges and accepted the prosecution’s offer to proceed on three out of the four charges. Two of these charges were for possession while one was for consumption. He admitted to the Statement of Facts for those three charges and was accordingly convicted. He consented to the remaining charge of possession of drug utensils being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.\n",

      " After a thorough review of the evidence adduced in the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case on the singular charge against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. To sum up, this is a case where although the Accused was not caught having the bag of drugs on his person and where the DNA evidence on the black bag and the packet of drugs inside did not include the Accused’s DNA, there was more than sufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had possession of the drugs by virtue of the drugs being found in the car for which he was in charge of at the material time and to which he had the key, and that he knew full well that the drugs were for the purpose of trafficking. The Accused was initially represented by counsel. The Defence Counsel applied to be discharged from acting for the Accused after the testimonies of PW1 and PW2 were completed. The Accused continued without counsel and was convicted after trial. He is dissatisfied with the conviction and has filed this appeal against conviction only. The black bag of drugs was found in the car and the Accused was the person in charge of the car for the time being, therefore the presumption of possession of the drugs applied to the Accused. It is a rebuttable presumption and the burden is on the Accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not know that the bag was in the car.\n",

      " Having considered all the evidence, I disbelieved the accused and rejected his defence. I found that he has not rebutted the presumption of trafficking on a balance of probabilities. In conclusion, I found that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The accused was accordingly convicted of the two trafficking charges. The accused then decided to plead guilty to six of the stood down charges (“PG charges”). He was therefore convicted of a total of eight charges. He admitted to and consented for the remaining 11 stood down charges to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentence (“TIC charges”). He was sentenced to a global sentence 17 years and four months’ imprisonment, and 20 strokes of the cane. Considering the weight of methamphetamine in this case vis-à-vis the full sentencing spectrum, and taking into account the accused’s culpability, the TIC charges and the fact that the accused has shown no remorse, I agreed with the prosecution that an imprisonment sentence of at least 15 years was justified. I noted that the accused in Loo Pei Xiang was convicted of a charge of enhanced trafficking of 11.64 grams of methamphetamine. The sentence was adjusted by the appellate court to 12 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane for that amount of methamphetamine. If we compare the weight of the methamphetamine in Loo Pei Xiang with the present case, it is obvious that the amount in the present case (90.13 g) is more than seven times the amount in Loo Pei Xiang. The appellate court at [33] also considered a sentencing precedent in PP v Mohammed Shahdat Bin Mohd Kemarudin [2012] SGDC 312 where the offender was a repeat trafficker who trafficked 18.92 grams of methamphetamine. The appellate court approved of the sentence of 13 years’ imprisonment and 13 strokes imposed in that precedent. As such, given the much larger quantity of methamphetamine in the present case, the sentence of 15 years imprisonment imposed on the present accused can hardly be considered as manifestly excessive. The accused appealed only against the conviction and sentence in respect of the two trafficking charges. In other words, he did not appeal against the sentence in respect of the PG charges. He is serving his sentence pending the appeal.\n",

      " Having considered all the evidence, I disbelieved the accused and rejected his defence. I found that he was in possession of the controlled drugs for the purpose of delivering them. He was paid to do so. He suspected that he was delivering controlled drugs but was wilfully blind to that suspicion. I found that he had not rebutted the presumption of knowledge. In conclusion, I found that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The accused was accordingly convicted of the two charges. The accused, a 51 year old male Malaysian national, claimed trial to two charges of being in possession of controlled drugs for the purposes of drug-trafficking. The evidence showed that he entered Singapore with an accomplice and collected the drugs from another person. They then boarded a taxi and were about to deliver the drugs to yet another person when they were arrested. The accomplice has since pleaded guilty to his charges. The accused was convicted after a trial and sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment. In addition, he was also sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of the mandatory 15 strokes of the cane in respect of one of the charges. In was not in dispute and, essentially, the accused admitted that he and Azreen had collected the drugs (that were wrapped in a package) from Murugan and were in possession of the said drugs in a taxi to deliver the drugs to someone when they were arrested. There was no dispute that the accused and Azreen had possession of the drugs. The accused and Azreen had the common intention to meet Murugan so as to collect the drugs from him. Azreen collected the drugs from Murugan as instructed by the accused. Azreen then kept the drugs in his bag and got into the backseat of the taxi with the accused. Azreen placed the bag containing the drugs between them. I was satisfied that the bag containing the drugs was in the possession of both the accused and Azreen as soon as Azreen had placed it in his bag and certainly when they were in the taxi. I therefore found that the accused had in his actual possession the controlled drugs. It was not disputed that they were on their way to deliver the drugs to someone in Yishun. These undisputed facts constituted the actus reus of the charges against the accused. The accused was convicted of both drug-trafficking charges and sentenced to imprisonment.

The Accused was represented by counsel and was convicted after trial. The offence is punishable with a minimum imprisonment of 5 years and 5 strokes of the cane and a maximum of 20 years and 15 strokes. After hearing the submissions on sentence by the Prosecution and the plea of mitigation by the Defence, the Accused was sentenced to imprisonment of 16 years and an additional 6 months of imprisonment in lieu of caning to run consecutively. The Accused is dissatisfied and has filed this appeal against conviction and sentence. On 12 May 2015, Wira pleaded guilty and was convicted on a charge of possession of not less than 9.99 grams of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the MDA. He was sentenced to 17 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. On 17 November 2015, S Naidu pleaded guilty to two charges. One charge was for the offence of possession of 14.99 grams of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the MDA (this was unconnected to the charge faced by the Accused in this trial). The other charge was for the offence of selling the drugs of not less than 9.99 grams of diamorphine to Wira. He was sentenced on 14 March 2016 to a total of 20 years’ imprisonment and 20 strokes of the cane. Faced with the overwhelming testimonial and physical evidence adduced by the Prosecution against the Accused in proving his involvement in arranging the drug transaction between Wira and S Naidu, it was not surprising that the Defence Closing Submissions did not put up a strong case to the contrary. Instead, the Defence Counsel (“DC”) proffered an argument in his closing submissions that the Prosecution had failed to prove an element of the charge that the possession of the drugs were for the purpose of trafficking. The DC submitted that since Wira confirmed that he did not receive further instructions on what to do with the drugs found inside the bundle B1A1, the Prosecution had failed to prove that the Accused had instigated Wira to possess the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.\n",

Suthakar and Prabu are charged under s 5(1)(c) of the Act, which makes it an offence for a person to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug. The elements required in an offence under s 5(1)(c) of the Act are knowledge of the nature of the drug, which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2) of the Act, and act(s) done or offered to be done preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug. For all the reasons given above, I find both accused persons guilty as charged and convict them accordingly. Mr Johan also submitted that IO Ranjeet had induced Suthakar to confess in his statements by telling him that IO Ranjeet would get him a reduced charge if he admitted to the crime. This was denied by both IO Ranjeet and Mdm Malliga. Mr Johan pointed to Mdm Malliga’s purported admission that IO Ranjeet had said “if you cooperate, it is good for you”. It is clear from Mdm Malliga’s oral evidence that this was not something specifically said by IO Ranjeet before or during the recording of Suthakar’s statements, but something that she had heard Investigation Officers sometimes say to accused persons. Even if it had been said by IO Ranjeet to Suthakar, it was a general statement that cannot reasonably be inferred as an inducement affecting the voluntariness of the statement without more. Similar allegations were made by Mr Jeeva Arul Joethy (“Mr Joethy”) on behalf of Prabu. Prabu testified that IO Ranjeet had banged the table, called Prabu a liar, and told Prabu that if Prabu told the truth, he (IO Ranjeet) would be able to save him “from being hung” and would get him a jail term of 20 to 22 years. Prabu testified that the corrections in his 5 January 2015 statement were made because IO Ranjeet had told him that his (IO Ranjeet’s) boss was “not happy” and Prabu had to “change [his] statement” to ensure that Suthakar and Prabu had similar statements, such that IO Ranjeet could save them. Mr Joethy also submitted that it was “fantastically coincidental” that both accused persons had voluntarily changed their statements such that their accounts became consistent with one another. The only inference was that IO Ranjeet had provided some form of inducement or promise to both accused persons. I found this insufficient to establish a reasonable doubt that IO Ranjeet had indeed provided such an inducement or threat to Prabu. Both IO Ranjeet and Mdm Malliga testified that the accused persons had given their answers voluntarily. I see no reason for them to lie. I do not believe that Prabu would have given such a detailed account of his offence on a bare promise made by IO Ranjeet, whom he had no reason to trust.\n",

Suthakar and Prabu are charged under s 5(1)(c) of the Act, which makes it an offence for a person to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug. The elements required in an offence under s 5(1)(c) of the Act are knowledge of the nature of the drug, which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2) of the Act, and act(s) done or offered to be done preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug. For all the reasons given above, I find both accused persons guilty as charged and convict them accordingly. Mr Johan also submitted that IO Ranjeet had induced Suthakar to confess in his statements by telling him that IO Ranjeet would get him a reduced charge if he admitted to the crime. This was denied by both IO Ranjeet and Mdm Malliga. Mr Johan pointed to Mdm Malliga’s purported admission that IO Ranjeet had said “if you cooperate, it is good for you”. It is clear from Mdm Malliga’s oral evidence that this was not something specifically said by IO Ranjeet before or during the recording of Suthakar’s statements, but something that she had heard Investigation Officers sometimes say to accused persons. Even if it had been said by IO Ranjeet to Suthakar, it was a general statement that cannot reasonably be inferred as an inducement affecting the voluntariness of the statement without more. Similar allegations were made by Mr Jeeva Arul Joethy (“Mr Joethy”) on behalf of Prabu. Prabu testified that IO Ranjeet had banged the table, called Prabu a liar, and told Prabu that if Prabu told the truth, he (IO Ranjeet) would be able to save him “from being hung” and would get him a jail term of 20 to 22 years. Prabu testified that the corrections in his 5 January 2015 statement were made because IO Ranjeet had told him that his (IO Ranjeet’s) boss was “not happy” and Prabu had to “change [his] statement” to ensure that Suthakar and Prabu had similar statements, such that IO Ranjeet could save them. Mr Joethy also submitted that it was “fantastically coincidental” that both accused persons had voluntarily changed their statements such that their accounts became consistent with one another. The only inference was that IO Ranjeet had provided some form of inducement or promise to both accused persons. I found this insufficient to establish a reasonable doubt that IO Ranjeet had indeed provided such an inducement or threat to Prabu. Both IO Ranjeet and Mdm Malliga testified that the accused persons had given their answers voluntarily. I see no reason for them to lie. I do not believe that Prabu would have given such a detailed account of his offence on a bare promise made by IO Ranjeet, whom he had no reason to trust.\n",

      " Accordingly, as the elements of the charge against Farid had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, I convicted him of the charge. It is instructive to refer to the Court of Appeal’s decision in Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters [2014] 3 SLR 721 (“Ridzuan”). That was a case which also involved two persons charged jointly for trafficking in diamorphine in furtherance of a common intention, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA as well as s 34 of the Penal Code. The Court of Appeal explained how s 5(1)(a) of the MDA interacts with s 34 of the Penal Code.\n",
      "(a)     The purpose of s 34 is to impose constructive liability on a secondary offender in relation to an offence arising from a criminal act committed by the actual doer in furtherance of the common intention shared by both of them (at [27]). The actual doer in that case was convicted of trafficking in a controlled drug pursuant to s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA (at [28]).\n",
      "(b)     Where the elements of s 34 are satisfied, constructive liability for the criminal act which constitutes an offence is imputed to the secondary offender. There is no need for the elements of that offence to be made out additionally against the secondary offender (at [29]). Hence, in that case, there was strictly speaking no need for the elements of s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) to be made out against the secondary offender.\n",
      "(c)     To impute liability to a secondary offender under s 34, three elements must be shown: the criminal act, the common intention and participation (at [34]).\n",
      "(d)     The criminal act encompasses the aggregate of diverse acts done by the actual doer and secondary offender which collectively give rise to the offence that they have been charged with (at [35]). In that case, the criminal act encompassed the secondary offender’s arrangements to take delivery of the bundles of drugs and the actual doer’s collection of the drugs.\n",
      "(e)     The common intention can form before or during the commission of an offence (at [41]). The existence of the common intention must frequently be inferred from the offenders’ conduct and all other relevant circumstances (at [42]). The common intention must include the intention to commit the very criminal act done by the actual doer; only then will the criminal act done by the actual doer be considered to have been done in furtherance of the common intention of the actual doer and the secondary offender (at [43]). In that case, the common intention of both the actual doer and secondary offender was to collect any number of bundles of heroin. This thus encompassed the very criminal act for which the actual doer was charged – possession of seven bundles of heroin for the purpose of trafficking (at [56]). In this regard, the Court also found that the secondary offender knew that the drugs being collected were heroin (at [52]).\n",
      "(f)     The element of participation requires that the secondary offender participates in any of the diverse acts which altogether forms the unity of criminal behaviour resulting in the offence for which they are charged (at [36]). In that case, the element of participation was made out based on the secondary offender’s arranging for the collection of the bundles and relaying instructions to the actual doer to collect the bundles. Therefore, I found that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt all three elements of the charge. As stated above at [58]–[62], the evidence given by Hamzah also supported the Prosecution’s case against Tika. In this regard, one of Tika’s contention was that there was an absence of any record of calls between Tika and Hamzah in the FORT report of Hamzah’s mobile phone “H-HP2”. Hamzah’s evidence was that he had used “H-HP2” to call and receive calls from Farid and Tika. Although his calls with Farid were recorded in the FORT report in relation to Farid’s mobile phone “MF-HP”, there were no records of calls to and from Farid in the FORT report for “H-HP2”. In the Prosecution’s submission, the explanation for this was that the date and time of “H-HP2” had not been set to actual date and time.[note: 106] On 20 December 2013, “H-HP2” had been set to the date of 21 January 2010, and accounted for the lack of records of calls for 19 and 20 December 2013 with Farid and Tika. I accepted this explanation, and found that the lack of call records did not detract from the cogency of Hamzah’s evidence against Tika. At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the elements of the respective charges were made out against each of the accused persons, and I convicted them accordingly.\n",

      " The accused, Morgan Kupusamy, was convicted on 12 January 2017 of drug trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The agreed statement of facts disclosed that he had transported a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA from Malaysia into Singapore, and had given it to the co-accused, Johari Bin Katio, on the instructions of one “Siva”. A certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA was issued to him by the Public Prosecutor, and he was found to have played only a limited role as a courier within the scope of s 33B(2)(a). In my exercise of the discretion conferred by s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA, the accused was not sentenced to death, but to the minimum punishment prescribed by statute, that is, life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The accused, being dissatisfied with his sentence, has appealed. Based on the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the accused had proven on a balance of probabilities that his role in the offence was restricted to that of transporting the diamorphine within the scope of s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA. Indeed, according to the agreed statement of facts, the task assigned to the accused by the said “Siva” was precisely to deliver drugs from Malaysia to Singapore.[note: 21] Those facts also showed that, on 5 December 2014, all that the accused did was to collect the drugs in Johor Bahru, and meet up with the co-accused in Singapore to pass the drugs on to the latter. The accused did keep the drug in his car for a few hours on that day, but I accept that that was merely “incidental” to the transportation and delivery of the drugs to the co-accused, and therefore within the qualifier identified in Chum Tat Suan. There was nothing to suggest that the accused had gone beyond the scope of s 33B(2)(a). I therefore found that the requirements in s 33B(2) of the MDA were satisfied. On the basis of the matters disclosed in the agreed statement of facts, I found that the accused had satisfied the elements of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA and was guilty of the Charge as framed. In respect of the appropriate sentence, under the MDA, while the death penalty is prescribed for offences under the sixth column of the Second Schedule, which includes the offence with which the accused was charged, s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA allows the Court to instead impose imprisonment for life and caning of not less than 15 strokes, if the requirements of s 33B(2) are met. The legislative purpose of this provision is “to provide a less harsh sentence for drug couriers who are willing and able to assist the [CNB] ... in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore” (Public Prosecutor v Chum Tat Suan [2015] 1 SLR 834 (“Chum Tat Suan”) at [4]).

      " In the light of the overwhelming evidence against the accused, the Defence did not contest the elements of the charge.[note: 30] Accordingly, I found that the Prosecution had proven Charge B1 beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore convicted the accused on Charge B1. Without relying on the Collateral Evidence and confining myself to the evidence pertaining solely to the Fourth Consignment, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved all the elements of Charge B1 beyond a reasonable doubt. First, with respect to possession, it was incontrovertible that the accused was in actual possession of the Fourth Consignment. He physically collected it from the bicycle, brought it back to the Van and was arrested with the red plastic bag containing the Fourth Consignment placed next to him.[note: 22] He also did not challenge the finding by the HSA that the Fourth Consignment contained 40.37g of diamorphine.[note: 23] For trafficking in excess of 15g of diamorphine, the accused faced the death sentence. Rather than contesting the elements of the offence, the Defence focused its efforts on availing the accused of the court’s discretion not to impose the death penalty under s 33B(1)(a) read with s 33B(2) of the MDA. In essence, and with regard to the present case, the MDA had two requirements that must be satisfied before the court could exercise its discretion not to sentence an offender to death: Public Prosecutor v Ranjit Singh Gill Menjeet Singh and another [2017] 3 SLR 66 (“Ranjit Singh”) at [53]. First, the offender must prove on a balance of probabilities that he was a mere courier by satisfying the conditions under s 33B(2)(a) (“Courier Exception”). Second, the Public Prosecutor must certify under s 33B(2)(b) that the offender had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities (“Certificate of Substantive Assistance”). At this juncture, I pause to note that the Prosecution adduced evidence which showed that the accused had helped Abang to collect and deliver three consignments of diamorphine prior to his arrest (“Collateral Evidence”). These three consignments did not form the subject matter of Charge B1, and the Prosecution sought to use the Collateral Evidence to prove the element of knowledge in Charge B1.[note: 19]\n",

      " I therefore found that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. Accordingly, I convicted the accused on the charge. Pursuant to s 33(1) and the Second Schedule of the MDA, the accused faced the death sentence for trafficking in excess of 15g of diamorphine. The Defence did not contest that the elements of the offence were made out.[note: 67] Instead, the main issue on which the Defence sought the court’s determination was whether the accused had met the conditions of s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA (“Courier Exception”).[note: 68] In other words, the principal finding sought by the Defence was whether the accused’s role was that of a mere courier. In submitting that the accused was a mere courier, the Defence argued that not all instances of repacking would preclude an offender from falling within the Courier Exception.[note: 87] However, in my view it was clear from the case authorities that acts of repacking had to be necessary for or incidental to the delivery (and other statutory acts) if the accused were to be a mere courier: see Chum Tat Suan at [68]; Ranjit Singh at [64]; and Christeen at [68]. In this regard, Ranjit Singh was especially instructive given its close similarities with the present case. Therein, the second accused (“Farid”) was charged for possessing 35.21g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. Weighing scales and empty plastic bags were found in Farid’s rented apartment, which Farid had intended to use to repackage the diamorphine into smaller packets each containing 7.7–7.9g of the drug. In rejecting Farid’s submission that such acts of repacking were that of a mere courier, the High Court found that Farid’s role of weighing and repacking the drugs “was essentially a matter of convenience for facilitating distribution or sale; it was not necessary for or incidental to enabling the drugs to be transported” [emphasis added] (at [64]). The High Court therefore imposed the mandatory death sentence on Farid. With regard to the 83 Packets, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had established the following elements of the offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA: (a) possession of a controlled drug; (b) knowledge of the nature of the drug; and (c) possession of the drug for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised:[note: 52] see Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters [2014] 3 SLR 721 at [59].\n",

      " The accused did not raise any substantive defence to the charge. At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved the charge beyond a reasonable doubt against the accused. I found him guilty and convicted him of the charge. The Prosecution had proved the charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted the accused of the charge. Under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, the punishment prescribed for the charge is death. Section 33B(1)(a) provides that if the twin requirements set out in s 33B(2) are satisfied, the court has a discretion not to impose the death penalty. The accused sought to avail himself of the alternative sentencing option. While there was no dispute that the accused’s acts fell within s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA (which the courts have referred to, for the sake of convenience, as acts of a “courier”), the accused did not satisfy s 33B(2)(b) because the Public Prosecutor did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance. As the second requirement was not satisfied, I did not have the discretion to impose the alternative sentence. I therefore imposed the mandatory sentence of death. In its closing submissions, the Prosecution submitted that it was not contested that the accused was in possession of the three packets of drugs; that he was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of delivering them to someone, ie, for the purpose of trafficking; and that he knew that the drugs were diamorphine or heroin. Therefore, the charge was proved against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The Defence did not challenge the Prosecution’s position.\n",

      " For completeness, even if I were to find that the presumption of possession (and that of knowledge in s 18(2) of the Act) had not been rebutted, I would still have found that the Prosecution failed to make out its charge. It has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the additional pound of heroin was in Ng and Cheng’s possession for the purpose of trafficking. It is clear from Ng and Cheng’s statements that they were taken by surprise at the additional weight and were undecided as to what to do with it. Cheng had testified that he was “worried and scared” and all he wanted to do was to “go back [to Delight Court] and open [the bundle]”. Ng stated that he “did not think too much about” the fact that the bundle was bigger than usual. In the circumstances, there is reasonable doubt as to whether they had formed any intention regarding the heroin during the drive home (other than to return home to open the bundle), let alone a common intention to traffic it. It is usually sufficient for the purposes of proving possession that the accused persons had personally collected the bundle. They could not claim to not have knowledge of the existence of the thing they had handled and placed in their sight. In this case, I find it likely that Ng and Cheng had ordered one pound of heroin to be collected on 16 May 2014. It may be improbable for their supplier to have (mistakenly or otherwise) oversupplied them, but Ng and Cheng’s evidence has been credible and consistent throughout. Despite the lack of clarity about when the heroin was ordered, they have consistently maintained that they had only ordered one pound of heroin, from the point of their arrest (Ng’s contemporaneous statement), to the recording of their long statements, and to their oral testimonies at trial. Their version of events is corroborated by their text message history, which reflects a general pattern of ordering only one or half a pound of heroin. The Prosecution has not contested Ng and Cheng’s evidence that their orders for heroin were reflected accurately in the text messages. It has also not disputed Ng and Cheng’s pattern of ordering one or half a pound of heroin at any given point in time, save for pointing out one text message (on 8 May 2014) recording their order for one and a half pounds.

Thus, I find that the Prosecution has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Ng and Cheng had knowledge of the existence of the additional pound of heroin. The original charge faced by Ng and Cheng was that they were in joint possession of 21.58g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, in furtherance of their common intention to traffic in drugs. For the reasons given above, I amend the charge to joint possession of 10.17g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, thereby committing an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Act, and convict both Ng and Cheng on this amended charge.

      " After a thorough review of the evidence adduced in the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case on the singular charge of joint possession for the purpose of trafficking drugs against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. The conclusion at the end of the trial, from the overall picture painted and proved by the evidence adduced, is that both of them – the Accused and Haryani – were involved together, with the Accused taking the lead, as seen from the telephone records. That was why there was a phone message to Haryani by a customer asking her to contact the Accused because the Accused did not answer the customer’s phone calls. The Accused cannot escape his involvement in the drug transactions when such involvement is proved on the evidence presented and viewed holistically. The Accused was therefore found guilty and convicted of the joint trafficking charge accordingly. The Accused was represented by counsel engaged by CLAS and was convicted after trial (hereinafter referred to as “the Conviction”). The offence is punishable with a minimum imprisonment of 5 years and 5 strokes of the cane and a maximum of 20 years and 15 strokes. After recording the Conviction, the Accused decided to plead guilty to the 4 other charges which were stood down pending the outcome of the trial on the Trafficking charge.

      "ii)     As evidence of the accused’s propensity to seek and effect change, the accused was able to successfully shed his excess weight and control his obesity, by losing approximately 30 kilograms and maintaining his weight since.\n",
      "iii)     Positive testimonials[note: 6] from a) the accused’s principal, Ms Hilda Thong (“Ms Thong”) suggests that the accused has the ability to rehabilitate as he was ‘consistent and focused in his work’, ‘displays a strong capacity for growth’ and a person who has ‘a positive outlook on life’ and ‘the ability and character to contribute positively to any organisations he joins in the future’; as well as from b) Mdm Balkis Bte Kassim (“Mdm Balkis”), the parent whose daughter was tutored by the accused for the subject of Principles of Accounting, describing the accused as ‘a respectful and soft-mannered person, who is a bright student’, and whose daughter scored A+ in the exams, for which it would not have been possible without the accused’s guidance.\n",
      "iv)     The accused is remorseful as evident from his earnest desire and capacity to reform as well as his co-operation with the authorities through his admission of the extent of his drug activities (notwithstanding there was no evidence to prove the same, namely the TIC charge).\n",
      "v)     The accused had indicated his plea of guilt at the very outset even before the prosecution had made an offer in relation to the charges to be proceeded with and to take into consideration.\n",
      "vi)     The accused has since his arrest on 29 August 2017, ceased all contact with his negative peers and is now fully cognizant of the nature of his reprehensible actions[note: 7].\n",
      "vii)     The accused’s strong family support and social framework would aid his rehabilitation where apart from his mother, other family members including his elder brother, sister and maternal uncles and aunt as well as maternal grandmother are fully committed in assisting the accused in his rehabilitation[note: 8] through their advice and supervision. In that regard, the prosecution objected to the imposition of probation and submitted for reformative training as the accused’s capacity for rehabilitation is not demonstrably high for the following reasons:\n",
      "i)      Ineffective familial supervision – given that the drug trafficking and consumption offences were committed in a setting where there was ineffective familial supervision and discipline; in particular, the accused’s mother (“Mdm Zullaiha”) was unable to curb the accused’s late nights, improve his poor attendance in school or detect his gambling and drug activities for a ‘long period of seven months’. Neither was she able to create structure for the accused which enabled him to complete the Guidance Programme (“GP”). Whilst Mdm Zullaiha had enlisted the help of the maternal grandmother previously to advise and supervise the accused in the past, these supervisory efforts have proved to be futile as it did not deter the accused from misbehaving. Furthermore, it was submitted that notwithstanding Mdm Zullaiha’s proposal to enlist the help of the accused’s elder brother and two maternal uncles to supervise the accused, the effectiveness of their supervision is untested and there was thus nothing remarkable or compelling about the level of familial support in the current case.\n",
      "ii)      Frequency and intensity of drug activities – the accused was a drug trafficker and a drug consumer where he had ‘a lengthy history of at least seven months of drug-related activities[note: 17] ’. Further, prior to his arrest, the accused had also sold drugs for profit to fund his personal expenses. As observed by the Investigation Officer from CNB (“IO”), Mr Mohamed Faizil, the accused ‘played a substantial role’ where he made the effort to source for the supplier to buy the drugs from[note: 18] and even provided drugs to his teacher. It was submitted that the accused was ‘deeply rooted in the drug scene’ such that he was able to identify a cheaper drug supplier at Geylang Lorong 18, ‘through asking around’.\n",
      "iii)      Lack of genuine remorse – whilst the accused may have outwardly professed his remorse, it was submitted that he lacks genuine remorse given that he ‘minimised and justified his drug consumption’ stating that there were no ill effects in consuming cannabis (or marijuana), thereby indicating ‘a supportive attitude and acceptance towards drug use[note: 19]’.\n",
      "iv)      Other risk factors[note: 20] highlighted included i) his history of offending where he was arrested for mobile phone theft and placed on GP; ii) his several disciplinary problems in school[note: 21]; iii) his association with antisocial peers where he started consuming drugs with a drug peer which also created easier accessibility for him to obtain drugs. In addition to consuming cannabis, the accused had bought cannabis and had passed it to his friend, Clifford, with the intention of consuming the cannabis together (TIC charge). As for the trafficking of methamphetamine charge, the accused had purchased the drugs for his teacher, Celesta. Although there was only one charge of trafficking of methamphetamine preferred against the accused for the occasion in August 2017, the accused had admitted purchasing the drugs for Celesta on two other occasions in January 2017 and April 2017[note: 41]. It would appear that the accused had acted as an intermediary between the supplier and Celesta, in the sense that he collected money from Celesta in order to obtain drugs from the supplier on Celesta’s behalf. In all these transactions the accused did not profit monetarily (proceeded and TIC charges respectively). I also note that the accused had admitted to selling methamphetamine to Shafirul on two occasions in April and August 2017 and received $20 on each occasion (although these were not the subject matter of the charges). In the case of Praveen, he faced similar number of charges as the current case where he had pleaded guilty to one count of consumption of cannabis and one count of possession of cannabis mixture for purposes of trafficking. An additional charge of possession of cannabis for the purpose of trafficking was taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing. The offender had purchased drugs from five suppliers on 15 occasions over a four-month period and his drug-related activities were only limited to that four-month period. In Leon Russel Francis, the offender had a longer history of at least ten months (if not more) of drug-related activities. In both these cases, probation was granted nonetheless. Further, in the case of PP v Ng Stephanie Tin [2012] SGDC 274 (“Stephanie Tin”), which involved a 17-year old offender who pleaded guilty to two charges of drug trafficking. Six other drug-related charges were taken into consideration for sentencing, three of which involved further counts of drug trafficking or possession for the purposes of trafficking. At the time she was sentenced, the offender was already serving a term at the drug rehabilitation centre. Despite being previously placed on probation for an offence under the Intoxicating Substances Act (Cap 146A, 2001 Rev Ed), dabbling in hard drugs and facing more charges than the present accused, probation was nevertheless granted. Similarly, for the case of Justin Heng, who was 20 years old, and pleaded guilty to significantly more charges[note: 42] than the present case and probation was similarly granted. The accused has not re-offended since his arrest and has ceased all drug-related activities. All his post-arrest urine tests were negative. I note, however, that the accused was previously placed on GP for committing theft of a mobile phone in 2014, where the case was ‘closed unsatisfactorily’ on 16 October 2014 given the accused’s ‘overall unsatisfactory conduct’. That said, it was also strictly not a previous conviction. Be that as it may, I note that this offence is a property-related offence which is different in nature from the current drug-related offences and was committed some three years before committing the current drug charges, which is a significantly long period. Whilst it may be argued that the accused has escalated in his offending behaviour by committing drug trafficking charges which are far more serious, I also note that he has not committed any property-related offences since 2014 and also not re-offended since his arrest for the current charges. Coupled with Mr Ramadhan’s assessment that the accused is now a ‘mature youth with potential to excel in life[note: 43],’ I did not think that the accused has deep-seated criminal traits that would hinder his successful rehabilitation, nor did he commit a litany of offences while out on bail (see Leon Russel Francis at [20]). As similarly noted by Chong JA in Praveen’s case at [54], I am also of the view that the present case can thus be distinguished from the case of Adith[note: 44] where the offender re-offended while on bail. The issue then is whether ‘there were conditions in his life that were conducive to helping him turn over a new leaf’ (see Praveen at [45]), particularly if the accused would be able to sustain these recent changes after he is sentenced to probation. As stated in the preceding paragraphs above, I am confident that the accused would fully utilise this final chance given to him to prove that he is indeed capable of good behaviour and in sustaining these positive changes. Despite the recommendations for probation at home, I was however, minded to impose a period of hostel residence as part of the conditions of probation to instil discipline in the accused to sustain the recent good progress that he is currently making in ensuring that the accused is and continues to be tightly monitored. Further, it would also serve as a reminder to the accused and likeminded offenders of the seriousness of the offences committed for which deterrence should feature in the sentence, similar to that in Praveen’s case. As held by Chong JA in Praveen’s case at [34] which is instructive: The accused was sentenced to 27 months’ split probation with the following conditions: to remain indoors daily from 10pm to 6am; to reside in HopeHouse Hostel for a period of 9 months; to be on electronic monitoring for 3 months upon his discharge from HopeHouse Hostel; to perform 210 hours of community service; to attend a drug intervention programme; to undergo a regular urine test regime; to attend a Progress Accountability Court (PAC) review in four months’ time; and the accused’s mother to execute a bond of $5,000 to ensure his good behaviour. \n",

      " The Accused had a string of antecedents. He was first convicted in 1991 for rioting for which he was placed on probation. In 1993, he was convicted of theft. In 1995 he progressed into drug offences. In fact he was sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment for drug possession. In 2003, he was sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for drug consumption which was ordered to run consecutively with 2 sentences of 9 months’ imprisonment for the offences of failure to report for urine test. His total sentence was therefore an imprisonment term of 6 years 18 months and 3 strokes of the cane. Prior to the commission of the present offence, the Accused had been convicted on 26 February 2003 in Subordinate Court No. 24, vide DAC 2864/2003, for an offence of consumption of a specified drug, to wit, morphine, under s8 (b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) and sentenced under s33A(1) of the said Act to 6 years’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane. The conviction and sentence have not been set aside to date and the Accused was now liable to be punished under s33A (2) MDA.

I found that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the 2 charges. The accused was then sentenced to 6 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for each of the two charges, with sentences to run concurrently. He has filed an appeal against conviction and sentence. He is on bail pending appeal. At the conclusion of trial on 12 July 2018, the accused was found guilty and convicted on both charges. As he indicated that he wanted to plead guilty to the stood down charges, his case was adjourned to 28 August 2018 for the necessary documents to be prepared. However, when his case came up for hearing again, he indicated that he was claiming trial to the stood down charges. The prosecution sought a sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment per charge with the sentences to run concurrently. It was submitted that as the offences were committed at different times, they were not related or part of the same transaction. In view of the multiple charges, the prosecution sought a significant uplift in sentence for each individual charge to reflect the accused’s culpability. It also submitted that the accused’s long list of antecedents showed that he had a certain disregard for the law and urged the court to take that into consideration.\n",

      " The accused is a 44-year old male, pleaded guilty and was convicted of 1 charge of possessing diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, Rev Ed 2008) (‘MDA’) (‘first count’); 1 charge of consumption of methamphetamine under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, which is a specified drug in the Fourth Schedule of the MDA (‘second count’); 1 charge of possession of diamorphine under section 8(a) of the MDA (‘third count’); and 1 charge of possession of methamphetamine under section 8(a) of the MDA (‘fourth count’). 8 other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. Diamorphine and methamphetamine are listed as a Class A Controlled Drug in the First Schedule of the MDA. The accused was previously convicted of similar offences and liable for enhanced punishment under section 33(4A), 33A and 33(1) of the MDA for trafficking, consumption and possession. The High Court further considered precedents involving repeat traffickers at [30] to [34] and [41] of Loo, including Mohammad Raffie. In Mohammad Raffie, the accused faced 15 charges of drug offences. The Prosecution proceeded on 5 charges, with 10 charges taken into consideration. The accused was a repeat offender, a drug offender since 1987. In 1999 and 2007, the accused had convictions for enhanced consumption charges and in 2007, for trafficking charges. Out of the 5 charges proceeded with, 3 were enhanced charges for consumption and trafficking, and the trafficking charge involved 9.01 g of diamorphine, which is higher than the present case of 7.75 g of diamorphine. The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 14 to 15 years’ of imprisonment with caning, and highlighted that it was one of the more aggravated cases for drug offences under the MDA as the accused had numerous antecedents for such offences, see [5] of Mohammad Raffie. If that is the correct indicative starting point to use, to uplift the mandatory minimum starting indicator by imposing an imprisonment term of 11 to 14 years instead of 2 years, the High Court had the opportunity but did not comment that Mohammad Raffie was a manifestly inadequate sentence in light of the Vasentha considerations. Instead, the High Court highlighted that it is not good enough reason to increase the mandatory minimum sentence because the accused is a repeat offender, see [25] of Loo; or to impose a sentence that must be higher than the sentence for a previous charge without more, see [35] of Loo. Indeed, repeat offenders may appear again before the court more than once. The High Court’s decision in Loo is a reminder that the sentencing court has the discretion to impose an appropriate sentence on repeat offenders facing mandatory minimum sentences, having regard to the quantity of the drugs trafficked, the aggravating and mitigating factors in the case before the court. Applying the above sentencing considerations in the present case, given the large amount of diamorphine trafficked, there is good reason to impose a sentence that exceeds the mandatory minimum. In this case, an uplift of 3 years’ imprisonment from the mandatory minimum sentence and 10 strokes of the cane would send out a strong deterrent signal, given the higher amount of diamorphine trafficked. I also considered and imposed the mandatory minimum sentence for the remaining 3 charges the accused pleaded guilty to.\n",

      " Following a joint trial, I convicted both accused persons (“the Defendants”) on one charge of trafficking in a Class A controlled drug under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”), which is punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA. No certificate of substantive assistance was provided. I therefore imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of death on both of them. For the foregoing reasons, the Defendants were convicted of the respective charges as framed. No certificate of co-operation was granted by CNB in respect of either Defendants. Accordingly, the mandatory minimum sentence of death was passed in respect of Zainal and Rahmat.

The above reasons for finding that Rahmat failed to rebut the s 18(2) presumption also independently gave rise to the conclusion that actual knowledge was made out.

      " In light of the foregoing, I found that the elements of the charge against Jumaat had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted Jumaat of the charge. In coming to this conclusion, I should state that for reasons including the implausible claim made by Jumaat as to the last minute arrangements regarding the transaction, the illogical reasons proffered as to why he cut open the two cabbages, and the vain attempt to deny that he dropped the blue plastic of cash into the Lorry in the face of incontrovertible evidence, I did not find Jumaat to be a credible witness. At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the charge against Jumaat had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and convicted him accordingly. As the key factual disputes were pertinent to all three elements of the charge, I shall analyse the evidence, and then state my findings accordingly. Thereafter, I shall discuss why, in light of my findings on the key factual disputes, I accepted that the three elements of the charge had been established beyond a reasonable doubt against Jumaat. In this connection, I group the key factual disputes into three main areas. First, the parties disagreed over the nature of the arrangements made for the collection on 13 August 2015, and when the arrangements were made. Second, there was a dispute as to whether Jumaat dropped the blue plastic bag containing the sum of $18,500 into the Lorry. Third, the parties disagreed as to the reasons why Jumaat proceeded to open up two of the cabbages shortly after collecting them. I shall now deal with each area in turn. I should, however, state that I did not agree with the Prosecution’s submission that the drugs were meant for Jumaat, in that Jumaat intended to sell the drugs for profit. While Jumaat made arrangements for the collection and delivery of the drugs, and handed over a substantial payment in this process, without more, there was simply insufficient basis to find that his purpose was to sell the drugs. In the course of a drug transaction, a person entrusted to collect and deliver the drugs could also be tasked to hand over a payment or to collect a payment. The Prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Jumaat’s purpose was to traffic by selling the drugs. In any case, such a finding was not necessary to establish the third element. I shall, however, revisit this issue again in due course at [94] onwards.\n",

      " At the conclusion of trial, in which the accused challenged the admissibility of various inculpatory investigation (long) statements recorded from him, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. Upon delivering brief grounds for my decision to find him guilty, the accused was convicted and sentenced on 14 December 2017. I now set out the grounds of my decision in full. For the above reasons, I found that the defence was wholly unworthy of credit and unconvincing in the face of the overwhelming evidence against the accused. I was satisfied that the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that he had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. I therefore found the accused guilty as charged and convicted him. As provided in s 2 of the MDA, the term “traffic” means “to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute”, or to offer to do any of these acts. Having examined the totality of the evidence, and having reviewed the contents of the statements which were admitted after the ancillary hearing, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved the charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. My reasons for concluding thus are set out below. The trial was originally to have involved three accused persons who were to be jointly tried with each other, albeit on different charges involving differing quantities of drugs. The other two co-accused, Rashid bin Zali (“Rashid”) and Nordiana binte Mohd Yusof (“Nordiana”) initially faced related charges involving possession of 33.46 grams of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. They eventually elected to accept the Prosecution’s respective offers of reduced (non-capital) charges and plead guilty. By 11 August 2017, when the trial proper involving the charge against the accused commenced, Rashid and Nordiana had already been convicted and sentenced. Both of them were called to testify as prosecution witnesses in the present trial.\n",

In my assessment, Haikal had not proved, on the balance of probabilities, that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known that exhibit A1 contained controlled drugs, ie diamorphine. I did not accept his strained and contrived claims that he thought that exhibit A1 only contained consumable items, medical drugs, or sex enhancement drugs.

I found that Lingkes was not a credible witness. For all the above reasons, I found that Lingkes failed to rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge under s 18(1) and (2) of the MDA. He had failed to raise a reasonable doubt that he did not know of the existence of the Drugs in Bundle P3. Lingkes had “turned a blind eye” to circumstances which would have prompted a reasonable person to suspect and verify whether Bundle P3 contained the Drugs (Dinesh Pillai at [21]) and he did not verify the contents of Bundle P3 though he could easily have done so. Further, Lingkes had committed an act of trafficking in the Drugs by giving or delivering Bundle P3 which contained the Drugs to Alfian. Accordingly, I found that all the elements of the charge against Lingkes had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted Lingkes on the charge framed against him. As such, I found that the elements of the charge against Alfian had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted him on the charge framed against him. Lingkes’ defence was that he did not know that Bundle P3 contained the Drugs, but believed that it contained tobacco. Alfian admitted that he knew the contents of Bundle P3 but that he was simply a courier tasked to collect the Drugs and to pass them on to someone else. At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the charges against Lingkes and Alfian respectively, and I convicted them on their respective charges. As regards the element of possession, the Court of Appeal in Zainal bin Hamad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2018] SGCA 62 (“Zainal”) held that where the Prosecution seeks to prove the fact of possession, it must prove not only that the accused was in possession of the package or the container but also that he knew that it contained something, which may later be established to be the drugs in question (at [12]). The Prosecution need not prove that the accused specifically knew that he was in possession of drugs or even of something that turns out to be contraband; the question of whether the accused knew the package or container contained drugs is an inquiry that arises when considering the question of knowledge (at [12]–[13]). Once it is proved that the accused had physical control over or possession of the package or container that contained the thing in question, the court is entitled to infer that he had knowledge of the existence of that thing. It is then incumbent on the accused to discharge the evidential burden by raising a reasonable doubt that this was not the case (at [16]). In an appropriate case, the Prosecution may also rely on the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA.\n",

He had failed to raise a reasonable doubt that he did not know of the existence of the Drugs in Bundle P3. Lingkes had “turned a blind eye” to circumstances which would have prompted a reasonable person to suspect and verify whether Bundle P3 contained the Drugs (Dinesh Pillai at [21]) and he did not verify the contents of Bundle P3 though he could easily have done so. Further, Lingkes had committed an act of trafficking in the Drugs by giving or delivering Bundle P3 which contained the Drugs to Alfian. Accordingly, I found that all the elements of the charge against Lingkes had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted Lingkes on the charge framed against him. As such, I found that the elements of the charge against Alfian had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted him on the charge framed against him. Lingkes’ defence was that he did not know that Bundle P3 contained the Drugs, but believed that it contained tobacco. Alfian admitted that he knew the contents of Bundle P3 but that he was simply a courier tasked to collect the Drugs and to pass them on to someone else. At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the charges against Lingkes and Alfian respectively, and I convicted them on their respective charges. As regards the element of possession, the Court of Appeal in Zainal bin Hamad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2018] SGCA 62 (“Zainal”) held that where the Prosecution seeks to prove the fact of possession, it must prove not only that the accused was in possession of the package or the container but also that he knew that it contained something, which may later be established to be the drugs in question (at [12]). The Prosecution need not prove that the accused specifically knew that he was in possession of drugs or even of something that turns out to be contraband; the question of whether the accused knew the package or container contained drugs is an inquiry that arises when considering the question of knowledge (at [12]–[13]). Once it is proved that the accused had physical control over or possession of the package or container that contained the thing in question, the court is entitled to infer that he had knowledge of the existence of that thing. It is then incumbent on the accused to discharge the evidential burden by raising a reasonable doubt that this was not the case (at [16]). In an appropriate case, the Prosecution may also rely on the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA.\n",

      " At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the two charges against Nabill, and I convicted him on the charges. Under s 33(1) of the MDA, read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, the prescribed punishment is death. Pursuant to s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA, the court has a discretion not to impose the death penalty if the requirements set out in s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA are satisfied. I found that the requirements of s 33B(2)(a) were not satisfied and further, the Prosecution did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA. Accordingly, I passed the mandatory death sentence on Nabill. In sum, I rejected Nabill’s defence in its entirety and found his evidence unreliable, incredible and inconsistent with the objective evidence. I found that on either of the Prosecution’s alternative cases the elements of the 1st and 2nd Charges against Nabill had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted Nabill on the charges. As regards the element of possession, the Court of Appeal in Zainal bin Hamad v PP [2018] SGCA 62 (“Zainal”) held that where the Prosecution seeks to prove the fact of possession, it must prove not only that the accused was in possession of the package or the container but also that he knew that it contained something, which may later be established to be the drugs in question (at [12]). The Prosecution need not prove that the accused specifically knew that he was in possession of drugs or even of something that turns out to be contraband; the question of whether he knows the package or container contains drugs is an inquiry that arises when considering the question of knowledge rather than of possession (at [12]–[13]). Once it is proved that the accused had physical control over or possession of the package or container that contains the thing in question, the court is entitled to infer that he had knowledge of the existence of that thing. It is then incumbent on the accused to discharge the evidential burden by raising a reasonable doubt that this was not the case (at [16]). In an appropriate case, the Prosecution may also rely on the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA. Turning to the element of trafficking, even without the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Nabill possessed the drugs in question for the purposes of trafficking. The court is entitled to infer the drugs were in the possession of an accused for the purpose of trafficking on the basis of evidence such as the quantity of drugs, the presence of drug trafficking paraphernalia, the absence of evidence that the drugs were for his personal consumption and other circumstantial evidence substantiating a finding that he was involved in drug trafficking (see, eg, Raman Selvam s/o Renganathan v Public Prosecutor [2004] 1 SLR(R) 550 at [48]; Abdul Kahar bin Othman v Public Prosecutor [2016] SGCA 11 at [92]).

However, s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA gives the court the discretion to impose the alternative sentence of life imprisonment and a minimum of 15 strokes of the cane if the conditions under ss 33B(2)(a) and 33B(2)(b) of the MDA are met. I found that these conditions were met with respect to Mazlan, and exercised my discretion to impose life imprisonment. Caning was not imposed as Mazlan was over 50 years of age at the time of sentencing. On the other hand, Kay Yong had not fulfilled either requirement under s 33B(2) of the MDA.

As noted by the Court of Appeal in Hishamrudin bin Mohd v PP [2017] SGCA 41(“Hishamrudin”) at [18], two elements must be satisfied in order to prove actual possession: (a) that the accused person had physical control over the controlled drugs; and (b) that the accused person knew of the nature of the controlled drugs. Knowledge of “the nature of the controlled drugs” in this context refers to knowledge that the items were controlled drugs, and not knowledge of the specific nature of the drug in question (Hishamrudin at [18], citing Fun Seong Cheng v PP [1997] 2 SLR 796 at [53]–[56] and Tan Kiam Peng v PP [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 at [87]).

For completeness, I should add that with regard to the Prosecution’s alternative case, I would not have found that this element had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Given that no drug paraphernalia was found in either the Bendemeer Flat or the Ang Mo Kio Flat, and having regard to Kay Yong’s pattern of consumption and financial means, there was a “reasonable doubt” as to whether Kay Yong had intended to traffic the entire 459.4g of heroin found in his possession.

      " The accused was 43 years old at the time of arrest on 6 January 2015, and was working as a lorry driver for Kong Cheng Sdn Berhad.[note: 1] At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved all the elements of the charge beyond reasonable doubt. I therefore found the accused guilty and convicted him on the Charge. At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing to determine the admissibility of the Long Statements, I held that they were admissible. I found that the accused was not suffering from mild intellectual disability or interrogative suggestibility, and there was also no room for me to exercise my discretion to exclude the Long Statements on the basis that their prejudicial effect exceeded their probative value. In my judgment, the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the Long Statements were given voluntarily in the absence of oppression, and without any threat, inducement or promise (“TIP”) within the meaning of s 258 of the CPC. The Prosecution brought the Charge against the accused in respect of the Five Bundles. The elements of the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA were: (i) possession of a controlled drug, (ii) knowledge of the nature of the drug, (iii) proof that possession of the drug was for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised (Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters [2014] 3 SLR 721 at [59]). In the course of the trial, an ancillary hearing was also held to determine the admissibility of some of the accused’s statements for reasons that will be elaborated below. First, I noted that Dr Frumkin’s and Dr Giess’s evaluations of the accused were aided by an uncertified Tamil interpreter, Ms Nithya Devi (“Ms Devi”), who was working as a legal intern in the Defence’s law firm at the material time.[note: 87] In my view, this impugned the accuracy of Dr Frumkin’s report. In his own words, such a practice ought to be avoided because “[attorney staff] may consciously or unconsciously misinterpret statements in a more positive light for the individual’s legal case” [emphasis added].[note: 88] It was therefore surprising that Dr Frumkin had failed to take the elementary precaution of utilising a certified interpreter that would have immunised his tests from such problems arising from the use of a non-certified interpreter with a potential conflict of interest.\n",

Applying the Muhammad bin Abdullah framework, I was of the view that Abdul had not rebutted the presumption of trafficking in relation to the four drug exhibits. In my judgment, the Prosecution had proved the amended charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and I accordingly convicted Abdul on the amended charge.

As s 33B of the MDA was not applicable, I imposed the mandatory sentence of death on both accused persons. These are my reasons. This challenge had no merit. Even if the Court were to accept Abdul’s contentions, the words allegedly uttered by IO Basheer did not, objectively determined, amount to a threat, inducement or promise. There was no suggestion that IO Basheer had demanded that Abdul confess or admit to trafficking heroin before he would let him speak to his wife. Rather, the allegation was that IO Basheer did not allow Abdul to speak to his wife until he had finished giving his statements. It is difficult to accept how this subjectively caused Abdul to provide the six long statements over the course of seven days, from 11 August 2015 to 17 August 2015. These statements were recorded after the cautioned statement, where it was explained to Abdul that he would be sentenced to death if he was convicted of trafficking heroin.

Of relevance also was Sharom bin Ahmad and another v Public Prosecutor [2000] 2 SLR(R) 541 (“Sharom”), where the accused, who faced a capital charge, challenged the admissibility of a long statement in a similar vein. The Court of Appeal found that it “made no sense” that the accused’s free will “would be so easily weakened by his desire to see his wife that he would rather give a statement that would eventually bring him more harm than any advantage” (Sharom at [47]).\n",

      " Hence, in a case of trafficking in furtherance of a common intention, should all the elements of trafficking be made out against the ‘actual doer’, and, it is proven beyond reasonable doubt that the elements of s 34 of the Penal Code are fulfilled, constructive liability for trafficking would be imposed on the secondary offender. The elements for trafficking need not be additionally made out against the secondary offender (per [29] of Ridzuan). In this context, Mr Zulkifli would be the ‘primary’ offender, being in direct physical possession of the methamphetamine, while Mr Shahidin has been charged in a factual matrix where he is accused of being the ‘secondary’ offender. Accordingly, I am of the view that the proceeded charge has been proven beyond reasonable doubt, and convict Mr Shahidin of this charge. Given the situation above, it was incumbent on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Shahidin and Mr Zulkifli had the common intention to traffick the quantity of methamphetamine to Mr Fadli. Mr Jayakumar also noted that the presumption under s17[note: 71] of the MDA did not apply given the quantity was too low to trigger the presumption. The learned DPP countered that her case was instead premised on her reliance on the presumption under s18(4)[note: 72] of the MDA. Defence counsel has raised a final point that the charge against Mr Shahidin was not made out as the packet of Ice had not yet been handed over to Mr Fadli or any officer from the Central Narcotics Bureau at the time of arrest. In this regard, I would agree with the prosecution’s response[note: 87] that Mr Shahidin’s charge is not of trafficking simpliciter under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, but rather possession for the purpose of trafficking, vide a joint enterprise with Mr Zulkifli to supply a quantity of methamphetamine to the client who had made an implicated purchase; Mr Fadli. Hence, the charge does not impose a requirement for the prosecution to prove that an act of trafficking has taken place, by the delivery of the packet, but rather ‘(a)ll that needs to be shown is that the possession of the packet of Ice was for the purpose of trafficking i.e. that it was intended to be trafficked’.[note: 88]\n",

It bears reiterating that his admission recorded on 17 April 2017 after his arrest, to the same effect that the drugs found in his possession given to him by Kecik were intended for sale or distribution stood intact and unresoundingly clear. In conclusion, I am satisfied therefore that the prosecution has proven its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I find him guilty and convict him on the 4 charges. After his conviction on the trafficking charges, the accused accepted the prosecution’s offer on the remaining 6 charges.

One charge in DAC 923977/2018 was for consuming 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, a specified drug, under Section 8(b)(ii) punishable under Section 33A(2) of the MDA. Another charge in DAC 933555/2018 was for the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug, on or about 16 June 2018 at about 6.45pm, by having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking seven packets containing not less than 106.9g of vegetable matter in which 5-fluoro-MDMB-PINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group was detected, under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the MDA.\n",

      " Considering all the circumstances, I rejected the Accused’s contention that he had ordered 50grams of Methamphetamine but what was delivered was diamorphine, which he did not know. I was satisfied that the elements of the charge against the Accused had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the charge. After the conclusion of the trial, both parties submitted their respective written submissions. Having considered the submissions and the evidence, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the charge against the Accused. Accordingly, I found him guilty and convicted him on the charge. In the circumstances, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that P9 was made by the Accused voluntarily and his statement was recorded accurately. Having heard the evidence and the submissions, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that both the statements were made voluntarily and admitted it as P29 and P30. I found that the allegations by the Accused that he gave the statements out of fear for the well-being of his wife was unfounded and untrue. I agreed with the Prosecution that the arrest of the Accused’s wife was because she was a suspect. She was arrested for urine testing. The Accused was not asked to give a particular account in his statement in exchange for a phone call to his wife. In any event, by the time the statement was recorded the Accused had been informed that his wife had been released. He was informed of his wife's release when his cautioned statement was recorded on 11 April 2017. I agreed with the Prosecution that if there were any fear, it was self-perceived which would not be considered as inducement. See PP v Lu Lai Heng [1994] 1 SLR (R) 1037 at [19].\n",

      " Coming back to the evidence of the main prosecution witnesses, namely Yuswi, Bella, Danial and Hakim, their combined testimony, it bears emphasis, have remained intact that it was the accused who gave the bag, P13, containing the drugs to Yuswi. The act of trafficking has been established as outlined under section 2 of the MDA as stated in the preceding paragraph. I agree with the prosecution that the core thread of their evidence was consistent, credible and detailed and proved that the trafficking act had taken place. I am satisfied that their evidence proves that the offence of trafficking has been made out beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore found the accused guilty and convicted him on all 5 charges. In respect of his failure to report for urine tests, based on his record, the accused has agreed that he had missed 29 tests and it was therefore undisputed that this was not the first time he had committed such an offence. While he had pleaded guilty to 1 charge, there were 2 other similar charges which had been TIC with his consent. The accused did not offer any reason why he had not complied with the order to submit himself for urine tests. I am aware that the defence had sought a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment but taking into account the relevant circumstances including the TIC charges, I was of the view that a 6 month term would be more appropriate. After his conviction on the trafficking charges, the accused pleaded guilty to 3 charges with 6 charges being taken into consideration(TIC) for the purpose of sentencing with his consent. After the prosecution closed its case, the defence made a submission of no case to answer, highlighting the discrepancies in the evidence of the key prosecution witnesses. The prosecution submitted otherwise. As I was not persuaded by the submission of the defence, I invited the accused to enter his defence to the 5 charges since I was satisfied that the prosecution had established a prima facie case against him. There was evidence adduced which satisfied each and every element of the charge. The threshold at this juncture is not high and the court is not required to determine the veracity of the witnesses. I then administered the standard allocution to the accused and he elected to give his defence. He also called Yuzwan as his witness.\n",

      " I accepted that the Accused was a drug abuser. Hence, he admitted the drugs found in him were for his consumption. However, it did not necessary mean that he was also not a drug trafficker. As stated above at [47], I see no reason not to give the full weight to exhibit P8. I was of the view that the evidence adduced by the Prosecution showed beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused was indeed a drug trafficker as per the charge. Accordingly, the Accused was found guilty and convicted of the drug trafficking charge (DAC941335/2017). The learned DPP submitted that the imprisonment term for the trafficking charge should be above the minimum prescribed sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment. Out of the 5 convicted charges, 2 of the sentences were to run consecutively. The main contentions by the Defence were in respect of the total sentence to be imposed and which of the sentences were to run consecutively. I was of the view that the global sentence of 5 years 11 months’ imprisonment adequately reflected the total criminality of the Accused and did not infringe the totality principle. I did not think the aggregate sentence was crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospect. He was just above the age of 50 at the time the sentence was imposed. The total sentence was also not substantially above the normal level of sentence for the most serious offence committed. The Accused was not only a drug abuser but he was also a drug trafficker. I noted that he had abused drug 2-3 times a week since 2015. His offending behaviour was clearly for a substantial period of time. The 2 consecutive sentences also took into account the different legally protected interests of the various charges, in particular, drug trafficking and drug consumption. Section 307 CPC also mandated the court to order 2 of the sentences to run consecutively as the Accused had been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 offences. I was of the view that the submission by counsel for the sentence in DAC 941355/2017 to run consecutively with the sentence in DAC 907167/2018 would mean that it would be better off for the Prosecution not to proceed with DAC 907167/2018 at all. That cannot be right. It was also not proportionate to the Accused’s overall criminality. Accordingly, I respectfully disagreed with the Defence on sentencing. The Accused is appealing against his conviction and sentence.\n",

      " At the end of the trial, I reserved judgment. Having considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties, I find that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt the charge against Faizal. Accordingly, I convict Faizal of the charge. I set out the reasons for my decision below. Having assessed the evidence, I am satisfied that Faizal had actual possession and knowledge of all six blocks of cannabis. Further, the evidence shows that he had possessed the six blocks of cannabis for the purpose of trafficking. Accordingly, the Prosecution has proven the charge against Faizal beyond a reasonable doubt. To conclude, I find that Faizal was in possession and had knowledge of all six blocks of cannabis from E1 to E6. I also find that he had possessed the six blocks of cannabis for the purpose of trafficking. Accordingly, given that all three elements have been fulfilled, I find that the Prosecution has proven its case against Faizal beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convict him accordingly. If indeed it cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Faizal had possession and knowledge of E1 to E3, the Defence contends that the charge should be amended pursuant to s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). Instead of “six (06) blocks” and “1562.97 grams of cannabis” as stated in the original charge, the charge should be amended to “three (03) blocks” and “394.87 grams of cannabis”. The applicable punishment would then be an imprisonment term of between 20 to 30 years and 15 strokes of the cane, as opposed to the mandatory death penalty.[note: 15]\n",

      " Having heard the evidence at the trial, I found that the charge against the accused had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and convicted him accordingly. Brief grounds of decision were read at that time. The accused has appealed against my decision. I now set out the full grounds of my decision. For the reasons above, I concluded that the accused’s statements had been accurately recorded and were reliable, and that the accused’s account in court was a desperate and unconvincing series of lies designed to explain away his highly incriminating statements. The accused did not raise a reasonable doubt, let alone sufficient proof on a balance of probabilities, to challenge the cogent evidence that he had possessed “D1A1A1” together with the remaining 45 packets for the purpose of trafficking. I therefore convicted him on the charge. The total weight of the diamorphine in the 46 packets was therefore 25.68g. The contents of the 46 packets formed the subject matter of the charge. At no point during the trial did the Defence challenge the seizure, transport or analysis of these exhibits, and I was satisfied with their integrity. There was also no real challenge by the Defence to any of the facts I have summarised above. When the accused gave his evidence, he supplemented his reasons for the alleged inaccuracies in his investigative statements. The accused claimed that before the recording of the 5 December statement, he had asked if he could make a phone call home, but was told that he would have to give his statement first; he was therefore not paying attention when the statement was read back to him, as all he could think about was the death penalty and his promised call home. Both these points were not put to ASP Imran. The accused said his mind was a blank and he therefore did not notice all the inaccuracies in the statement. The accused also claimed that when the cautioned statement was recorded, he had pointed out to SSSgt Rias that he should only be charged for 45, not 46, packets, but that SSSgt Rias had ignored him. This was also not put to SSSgt Rias. He did not insist on his objection being recorded as he was not aware that he could.\n",

The Accused took issue with various aspects of the investigations, alleging that there were various leads that were not followed through.

Even before 23 September 2016, Nazeeha already knew that Reduan was involved in drug activities. She admitted that the delivery of the “barang-barang” on 23 September 2016 was unusual, especially given that she had not ordered anything. Her reason for not verifying the contents of the Daia Box because Tan was a bubbly and jovial person whom she would not have suspected was involved in any drug, was unconvincing.

I also found that she had seen the Words on the Envelope and known of its contents, and I accepted Tan’s account that Nazeeha had told him about some money in it being his “kopi money” – Reduan himself confirmed he had told Nazeeha there was money in the Envelope. Accordingly, I was satisfied that the elements of the charge against Nazeeha had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted her on the charge. Hence, I found that Tan knew that the Daia Box contained drugs and that he knew of the nature of the drugs, independent of the presumptions. Tan’s suspicion and deliberate refusal to inquire were evidence which, against the backdrop of all the other evidence, sustained a factual inference that he had actual knowledge of the specific nature of the drugs (Adili at [45]), in this case methamphetamine. Moreover, Tan’s possession of the Daia Box (containing the Drugs) was for the purposes of trafficking – he admitted he intended to deliver it to Reduan and had passed the Daia Box to Nazeeha – and without authorisation.

The Prosecution need not prove that the accused specifically knew that he was in possession of drugs – that question is an inquiry that arises when considering the question of knowledge (at [12]–[13]). Once it is proved that the accused had physical control over or possession of the receptacle that contains the thing in question, the court is entitled to infer that he had knowledge of the existence of that thing. The accused then has to discharge the evidential burden by raising a reasonable doubt that this was not the case. The Prosecution may also rely on the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA, which an accused can rebut by showing that he did not actually know that the thing was in his possession, such as if it was slipped into his bag or planted without his knowledge: Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor [2019] 2 SLR 254 (“Adili”) at [34] and [71].\n",

      " At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the charge against the accused had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and convicted him accordingly. The mandatory sentence of death was passed on the accused. By the foregoing, I found that it had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the intention to traffic in the drugs. Alternatively, the accused did not successfully rebut the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA on a balance of probabilities. The charge against the accused had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted the accused of the charge. The accused has filed an appeal against conviction and sentence. I now provide the full reasons for my decision. The Prosecution’s case was that the accused’s consistent intention, from the time he received the drugs until his arrest, was to deliver the drugs to whomever Ah Chong directed him to. The intention to traffic in the drugs had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, based on the accused’s willing acceptance and storage of the drugs for a subsequent delivery on Ah Chong’s behalf. Alternatively, having established both possession and knowledge, the presumption of trafficking was invoked under s 17 of the MDA, and the burden was on the accused to rebut the presumption. This, the accused failed to do.[note: 63]\n",

For a charge of abetment to be made out, the abettor must have the intention for the primary offender (in this case Roszaidi) to carry out the conduct abetted (namely, to traffic in diamorphine). Azli had the intention to aid Roszaidi to carry out the trafficking of diamorphine, the nature of which he is presumed to know by virtue of the presumptions in ss 18(2) and 18(4) of the MDA. I am therefore satisfied that the charge against him has been proved, and I find him guilty and sentence him to suffer death. I next turn to the case against Roszaidi. Suhaizam drove the lorry with Aishamudin in the passenger seat from Malaysia to Bulim Avenue in Singapore where Aishamudin handed the plastic bag containing diamorphine to Roszaidi. I am satisfied that it was Roszaidi who collected the diamorphine from Aishamudin, and that he repacked the diamorphine in Azli’s car before handing them to Azidah. Roszaidi denies any knowledge of what he had taken from Aishamudin, or what he had handed to Azidah, but his testimony in court was not consistent with his own statements, and he had no satisfactory explanation in respect of the evidence of Aishamudin, Mirwazy, and Azli against him. With the diamorphine in his possession, he was obliged to rebut the presumption under law that he knew that he was in possession of diamorphine. His testimony fails to free him from that presumption. I therefore find Roszaidi guilty as charged and sentence him to suffer death. I am satisfied that Aishamudin delivered the red plastic bag containing diamorphine to Roszaidi. Aishamudin claimed that the red plastic bag contained only methamphetamine, but his testimony in court was not consistent with his own statements, and he has no satisfactory explanation in respect of the evidence of Suhaizam and Roszaidi against him. With the diamorphine in his possession, he failed to rebut the presumption that he knew that he was in possession of diamorphine. I find that he had the common intention with Suhaizam to traffic not less than 14.99g of diamorphine by delivering it to Roszaidi. I find him guilty on the charge as amended and convict him accordingly. I am also sentencing him to the same mandatory sentence that was imposed on Suhaizam, namely 25 years’ imprisonment with effect from the date of his (Aishamudin) remand, 8 October 2015, and 15 strokes of the cane. I will first deal with the case of Azli. The undisputed facts concerning him were that he drove Roszaidi to Bulim Avenue and was told to look out for a lorry. They spotted the lorry at Bulim Avenue, and Azli saw Roszaidi collecting a plastic bag from the men in the lorry. He then drove Roszaidi to meet Azidah at Jurong West St 91. After meeting her, Azli saw Azidah walking away from the car with the plastic bag that Roszaidi had packed.

      "full sentence or sequence: After the trial, the accused also pleaded guilty to one stood down charge involving consumption of a specified drug . As the accused has appealed against his sentence and conviction, I will now set out the reasons for my decision . I found that the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused received the drugs from Taamo at the Jelita loading / unloading bay and that he subsequently threw the drugs out of his car when he was in the vicinity of Dover MRT station . Taamo ’s evidence was unequivocal, his job was to bring drugs in from Malaysia and to hand them to one of “ John ’s ” men at Jelita in exchange for cash . However, the Court still had to decide the issue of whether the accused knew of the nature of the drugs . I took the following into account in arriving at my finding that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the requisite knowledge : 43.1 . The accused handed a large bundle of cash amounting to $10,000 to Taamo . Taamo testified that the person who handed him the cash said “ duit ” meaning cash . This meant that the accused knew full well he was handing a bundle of cash to Taamo and not just a few loose notes . The thickness of the bundle TV - A1 can be seen in photos 94 - 95 . The natural inference would be that he was receiving something of equivalent value in exchange . 43.2 . The accused would have been able to recognise that the black bag contained illicit drugs had he looked inside . Since he had just handed over $10,000 in exchange for the black plastic bag, it would stand to reason that he would have inspected the contents to make sure he had gotten what he had paid for . 43.3 . The accused ’s post - incident behavior of driving recklessly and subsequently throwing the drugs out of his car windows leads to the irresistible inference that he knew that the black plastic bag he received from Taamo contained illegal drugs . 43.4 .

      " Apart from the drugs-related prior convictions which form the predicate antecedents for the present charges which rendered the accused liable for enhanced punishments, the prosecution did not highlight or rely on other antecedents.[note: 3] The predicate antecedents were of course embodied in the charges and SOF which the accused had already admitted. In particular, the accused has a set of previous convictions in December 2011 which included a conviction for drug-trafficking also of diamorphine. He was sentenced in total to 6 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane. That would mean that the present set of drugs offences were committed not long after his release from prison. Counsel for the accused presented a very brief oral mitigation.[note: 4] The court was told that the accused is 34 years old and married with two young children. He was employed at the time of the offences but committed the offences due to gambling debts. Counsel accepted that the amount of drugs was reduced from 16.98 grams to 14.99 grams. Counsel also acknowledged that the accused has prior convictions for drug-trafficking and accepted the prosecution’s sentencing position that the starting point (in respect of the reduced drug-trafficking charge) ought to be 29 years’ imprisonment. Nonetheless, counsel urged the court not to impose a crushing sentence in respect of the reduced drug-trafficking charge due to the accused’s plea of guilt, co-operation with the investigations and the fact that he was only in his thirties. In short, counsel was asking for a further discount off the 29-year imprisonment sentence sought by the prosecution. The accused also consented for 30 charges to be taken into consideration by the court for sentencing purposes. The effect of taking into consideration outstanding charges (especially since these are also drugs-related) is to enhance the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed in respect of the proceeded charges (see PP v UI [2008] 4 SLR (R) 500 at [38]). There was therefore legal justification to impose a higher sentence than what would ordinarily be imposed for the reduced drug-trafficking charge. Bearing this in mind, I was satisfied that having regard to the facts of the case, the overall culpability of the accused, the multiplicity of the charges, and applying the sentencing principles of specific and general deterrence, I am of the view that the global sentence imposed is by no means excessive.\n",

      " Having considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties, I found that the accused failed to rebut the applicable MDA presumptions. I therefore convicted the accused of the charge under s 7 of the MDA. On sentence, I found that the accused was a courier within the meaning of s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA; in addition, the Public Prosecutor had issued a certificate of substantive assistance to the accused under s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA. The alternative sentencing regime under s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA was thus available to the accused. Accordingly, I exercised my discretion and sentenced him to life imprisonment (backdated to the date of the accused’s arrest on 25 October 2017) and caning of 15 strokes. Having provided brief oral grounds then, I now set out the full reasons for my decision. For the reasons above, I found that the accused failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know of the nature and quantity of the Drugs. I accordingly convicted him of the charge under s 7 of the MDA. Having been convicted of the present charge, the accused was liable to be punished under s 33(1) of the MDA. The punishment prescribed under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the MDA is death. Nevertheless, the court retained the discretion under s 33B(1)(a) read with s 33B(2) of the MDA to instead sentence the offender to life imprisonment and a minimum of 15 strokes of the cane, subject to the requirements in those provisions being met. Section 33B(1)(a) of the MDA provides that if the two cumulative requirements set out in ss 33B(2)(a) and (b) are satisfied, the court has the discretion not to impose the death penalty. The first requirement in s 33B(2)(a) is that the acts of the accused were restricted to those listed in s 33B(2)(a)(i)–(iv) of the MDA, which have been referred to as those of a courier. The second requirement in s 33B(2)(b) is that the Public Prosecutor certifies that the accused has substantially assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. The law on similar fact evidence has been comprehensively considered in recent decisions. In evaluating the admissibility of similar fact evidence, a balance must be struck between its probative value and its prejudicial effect. In this inquiry, the cogency, strength of inference the evidence provides and relevance of the evidence should be considered: see Ng Beng Siang and others v Public Prosecutor [2003] SGCA 17 at [40]–[42]; Public Prosecutor v Ranjit Singh Gill Menjeet Singh and another [2017] 3 SLR 66 at [17]–[19]. Where no discernible connection exists as between the past transaction and the transaction which forms the subject matter of the charge, it is unlikely that the three aforementioned touchstones of cogency, strength of inference and relevance will be satisfied. To admit such evidence would lead to reasoning by propensity, which has always been eschewed under Singapore’s evidential rules.\n",

      " As I noted earlier, the Prosecution relied on the presumptions under ss 21 and 18(2) MDA to establish the elements stated above in [36(a)] and [36(b)] respectively. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was not required to separately prove that the accused intended to import the drugs into Singapore. The word “import” in s 7 MDA should be accorded its ordinary meaning of bringing an object into the country (Public Prosecutor v Adnan bin Kadir [2013] 3 SLR 1052 at [6] and [67]). In the present case, there was no suggestion that the accused had not intended to enter Singapore. Instead, his defence was primarily that he had not been aware of the presence of the drugs in the motorcycle compartment. This was an effort to rebut the presumption under s 21 MDA. If the accused intentionally entered Singapore in knowing possession of the drugs, and with knowledge of their nature, it would follow that he intended to import the drugs. I was thus satisfied that the charge would be made out if the accused failed to rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge. Finally, I turn to the accused’s suggestion that he had come to Singapore in part to spend a day here with Ting. The defence argued that the fact that a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (“DNATA”) had been ordered in respect of Ting indicated that the Prosecution was satisfied that she was not involved in any drug activity. Ting had been with the accused from the time she got into his car and it was “quite clear” that neither of them had checked to see what was in the motorcycle compartment under the jacket or knew that the drugs were there. According to the defence, Ting would otherwise be facing criminal charges along with the accused. This line of reasoning was fundamentally misconceived. First, the DNATA ordered did not necessarily mean that Ting had not been involved in the alleged importation, or that the Prosecution took this view. Second, even if Ting was not involved, or did not know that the drugs were there, that did not necessarily mean the same could be said of the accused. The accused was the one who borrowed the motorcycle from Lew. In short, there was no basis for me to make any findings or inferences on her involvement, much less to factor that into my assessment of the accused’s credibility or state of mind. For the reasons above, I found that the accused did not prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know of the existence of the drugs in the motorcycle compartment. Consequently, I also found that he did have possession of the drugs. Given that possession, or the absence thereof, was the central premise of the defence, I convicted the accused of the charge. The Prosecution relied on the presumptions of possession and knowledge in ss 21 and 18(2) respectively of the MDA. The defence accepted that the presumptions applied and that the burden was on the accused to rebut the same on a balance of probabilities. The parties were in agreement that the sole issue I had to consider was whether the accused was in possession of the drugs, specifically whether he knew that the items which were later found to be drugs were in the storage compartment of the motorcycle he used when entering Singapore. Having considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties, I convicted the accused of the charge and passed the mandatory death penalty on him. I gave brief oral grounds then. The accused has appealed against my decision. I now set out the full reasons for my decision.\n",

      " Having regard to the foregoing evidence, the irresistible conclusion was that Salleh in fact had no qualms about dealing in more than 250g of methamphetamine, and that a transaction involving two bundles with a total gross weight of 500g of methamphetamine was certainly well within Salleh’s contemplation when he instructed Hadi to collect an unspecified quantity of methamphetamine from “Kakak”. Salleh’s defence was an afterthought which he deployed only because he had failed in his challenge to the admissibility of his contemporaneous and cautioned statements. As such, I found that Salleh satisfied the element of knowledge I referred to at [32] above. Since this was the only issue in contention by the end of the trial, and I was satisfied that every other element of the charge was made out on the evidence, I concluded that the charge against Salleh had been proven beyond reasonable doubt. As such, I concluded that the Prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that no threat, inducement or promise had been made to Salleh during the recording of either his contemporaneous statement or his cautioned statement. I admitted both statements into evidence accordingly. Having convicted both Salleh and Hadi on their respective charges, I heard submissions from the parties on sentence. Upon conviction, Salleh and Hadi faced the mandatory death penalty, unless they could bring themselves within the scope of the discretionary sentencing regime under s 33B of the MDA. All of the parties submitted solely on the s 33B(2) limb of the provision. Both the Prosecution and Hadi submitted that he was a courier within the meaning of s 33B(2)(a) MDA.[note: 138] I agreed that Hadi’s role was restricted to transporting and delivering the drugs. I therefore found that he fell within the scope of s 33B(2)(a). The Prosecution also tendered a certificate of substantive assistance in favour of Hadi.

      " At the end of the trial, I reserved judgment. Having considered the evidence led at trial and the submissions of the parties, I find that the Prosecution has proven the charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I convict him accordingly. Here are the reasons for my decision. I find that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was complicit in the Drug Transaction by (a) recruiting Shanmugam and Suief to be his drug couriers; (b) introducing Shanmugam to Suief on 12 October 2011 for the purpose of facilitating an impending drug transaction; (c) providing the Kenari car containing the Controlled Drugs to Shanmugam on 27 October 2011; and (d) coordinating the transport and delivery of the Controlled Drugs on 28 October 2011 by providing instructions to both Shanmugam and Suief. I thus convict the accused of the charge. It is the Prosecution’s burden to prove the elements of s 34 of the Penal Code beyond a reasonable doubt. To do so, it must adduce proof of the accused’s part in the specific events leading up to and including the trafficking of the Controlled Drugs on 28 October 2011. As the Prosecution’s case is heavily dependent on the testimony of the Couriers, their credibility and the weight to be attributed to their evidence in relation to each specific event thus lie at the heart of this case. In Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters [2014] 3 SLR 721 (“Ridzuan”), a case involving two individuals jointly charged for trafficking in diamorphine in furtherance of a common intention, the CA laid out the relevant principles governing the interplay between s 5(1)(a) of the MDA and s 34 of the Penal Code.\n",
      "(a)     The purpose of s 34 of the Penal Code is to impute constructive liability on a secondary offender in relation to an offence arising from a criminal act committed by the actual doer in furtherance of the common intention shared by the actual doer and the secondary offender (at [27] citing Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan v PP [2010] 4 SLR 1119 (“Daniel Vijay”) at [76]).\n",
      "(b)     To impute liability to a secondary offender under s 34 of the Penal Code, three elements must be shown, namely: (a) the criminal act; (b) the common intention; and (c) the participation (at [34]).\n",
      "(c)     The criminal act encompasses the aggregate of all the diverse acts done by the actual doer and secondary offender which collectively give rise to the offence that they have been charged with (at [35] citing Daniel Vijay at [92]). In Ridzuan, the criminal act encompassed the secondary offender’s arrangements to take delivery of the bundles of drugs from a “jockey” (a term for a courier) and the actual doer’s collection of the drugs pursuant to those arrangements from the “jockey”.\n",
      "(d)     The common intention can form before or during the commission of an offence (at [41] citing Daniel Vijay at [109]). The existence of the common intention must frequently be inferred from the offenders’ conduct and all other relevant circumstances (at [42] citing Daniel Vijay at [97]). The common intention must include the intention to commit the very criminal act done by the actual doer; only then will the criminal act done by the actual doer be considered to have been done in furtherance of the common intention of the actual doer and the secondary offender (at [43] citing Daniel Vijay at [166]). In Ridzuan, the common intention of both the actual doer and secondary offender was to collect any number of bundles of heroin handed to them by the “jockey”.\n",
      "(e)     The element of participation requires that the secondary offender either participates in the specific criminal act committed by the actual doer or that he participates in any of the diverse acts which altogether forms the unity of criminal behaviour resulting in the offence for which they are charged, such offence being commonly intended by all the offenders (at [36] citing Daniel Vijay at [163]). In Ridzuan, the element of participation was made out as the secondary offender arranged for the collection of the bundles and relayed instructions to the actual doer to collect the bundles.\n",
