      "1": "Two brothers, Lokman bin Abdul Rahman (\u201cLokman\u201d) and Mohamed Mubin bin Abdul Rahman (\u201cMubin\u201d), claimed trial to their respective charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cMDA\u201d). Lokman\u2019s evidence was that Mubin was a drug trafficker whom he was helping as a courier. Mubin\u2019s evidence was that Lokman was a drug trafficker in whose activities Mubin had no role. I found that the facts reflected the former scenario and not the latter. In the result, after both accused were convicted on amended charges, Lokman was sentenced to life imprisonment and the mandatory death sentence was imposed for Mubin. I explain the grounds of my decision hereunder.",
      "2": "On 8 September 2015, at around 10.30pm, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) arrested Lokman at the ground floor lift lobby of Katong Park Towers (\u201cKPT\u201d), 114A Arthur Road.[note: 1] He was carrying a black bag that contained, inter alia, two bundles of diamorphine later marked A1E1A and A1F1A, which formed the subject matter of the charges. A1E1A contained not less than 19.88g of diamorphine[note: 2] and A1F1A contained not less than 19.40g of diamorphine[note: 3]. The drug analysis and the chain of custody of the diamorphine were not disputed in this case.",
      "3": "Other drugs were found, which informed the context of the case. The black bag on Lokman\u2019s person had, in addition to A1E1A and A1F1A, five packets of diamorphine and 50 tablets (ethylone and methoxetamine). A further five packets of diamorphine and three packets of methamphetamine were recovered from a green and black bag also carried by Lokman. After his arrest, Lokman was brought to #08-06 South Tower at KPT (\u201cthe KPT Unit\u201d), where he was residing. A search was conducted there and the following were recovered: [note: 4]\n(a)     From the bedroom of the centre sub-unit of the KPT Unit, one packet and one straw of diamorphine, one packet of methamphetamine, and a roll of black tape.\n(b)     From the living room of the same sub-unit, six packets of diamorphine, three rolls of black tape, and a clear plastic wrapped with black tape.",
      "4": "After Lokman\u2019s arrest, and under the supervision of CNB officers, Lokman used his mobile phone to communicate with one \u201cEdy\u201d and Mubin. The CNB officers recorded these conversations. These recordings were later transcribed and translated.[note: 5]",
      "5": "According to the tenancy documents, the KPT Unit was rented to Mubin and one Siti Rohani binte Mohamed Ali. Mubin\u2019s girlfriend, Tihani binte Ibrahim (\u201cTihani\u201d), had used Siti Rohani binte Mohamed Ali\u2019s identity card for the purpose of securing the lease. The monthly rental of $1,800 was paid by Mubin.[note: 6] Tihani and her infant son were at the KPT Unit on the night Lokman was arrested.",
      "6": "Mubin was subsequently arrested on 5 October 2015 at around 5.40pm at M28 Minimart, Blk 182A Rivervale Crescent.[note: 7] At the time of his arrest, two packets of methamphetamine, three packets of diamorphine, empty sachets, and a weighing scale were found on him.[note: 8]",
      "7": "Lokman and Mubin were tried on the following charges:",
      "8": "These charges against Lokman and Mubin were based on s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. Sections 5(1)(a) and 5(2) read as follows:",
      "9": "The term \u201ctraffic\u201d is defined under s 2 of the MDA as follows:",
      "10": "The elements of a charge under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA are as follows (per Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters [2014] 3 SLR 721 at [59]):\n(a)     possession of the controlled drug;\n(b)     knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug; and\n(c)     the possession of the drug was for the purpose of trafficking, which was not authorised.",
      "11": "As for Mubin, his charge was for abetment by instigation. Liability for abetment is provided for under s 12 of the MDA. Section 12 reads:",
      "12": "The term \u201cabets\u201d under s 12 of the MDA is given the same meaning as that under s 107 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cPenal Code\u201d): Iwuchukwu Amara Tochi and another v Public Prosecutor [2006] 2 SLR(R) 503 at [8]. Hence, it is taken to include, inter alia, abetment by instigation, which is the mode of abetment alleged by the Prosecution in this case. In order to establish the charge of abetment by instigation, the Prosecution must prove the following:\n(a)     the actus reus of instigation, that is, \u201c\u2018active suggestion, support, stimulation or encouragement\u2019 of the primary offence\u201d: Chan Heng Kong and another v Public Prosecutor [2012] SGCA 18 at [34]; and\n(b)     the mens rea of instigation, that is, the intention on the part of the abettor for the person abetted to perform the act abetted, and knowledge of the circumstances constituting the offence: Balakrishnan S and another v Public Prosecutor [2005] 4 SLR(R) 249 at [64]; Public Prosecutor v Koh Peng Kiat [2016] 1 SLR 753 at [24].",
      "13": "The Prosecution\u2019s case against Lokman was that he was in possession of A1E1A and A1F1A with actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs, and that he had possession of the drugs for the purpose of delivering one of the bundles to Edy and the other to Mubin at a flat in Holland Close (\u201cthe Holland Close Flat\u201d). In the alternative, the Prosecution relied on s 17 of the MDA to establish by presumption that Lokman\u2019s possession of the drugs was for the purpose of trafficking.[note: 9] The Prosecution\u2019s case was that Lokman was acting under Mubin\u2019s instructions in performing these various acts.[note: 10]",
      "14": "As against Mubin, the Prosecution sought to prove that he gave instructions to Lokman to retrieve the two bundles of diamorphine from the KPT Unit in order to deliver one bundle to Edy and to return the remaining bundle to Mubin. Their case was that Mubin was running a drug trafficking business and Lokman was assisting him. They alleged that Mubin received the two bundles from Mohd Zaini bin Zainutdin (\u201cZaini\u201d) and Mohd Noor bin Ismail (\u201cNoor\u201d) in the week prior to Lokman\u2019s arrest and stored them at the KPT Unit. On 8 September 2015, Lokman was carrying out Mubin\u2019s instructions when he was arrested.",
      "15": "Lokman admitted to possession of A1E1A and A1F1A with the knowledge that they contained diamorphine. Lokman maintained throughout the investigations and the trial that he worked for Mubin, doing various tasks in exchange for accommodation, drugs, and money.[note: 11] His response to the charge was essentially that he was a courier.",
      "16": "Lokman\u2019s account of 8 September 2015 began with a telephone call from Mubin in the afternoon, asking him to return to the Holland Close Flat. When he did so, he received instructions from Mubin to retrieve all the drugs stored at the KPT Unit and bring them back to the Holland Close Flat. In particular, Lokman was instructed to retrieve two bundles of heroin, the street name for diamorphine, and any other drugs that remained at the KPT Unit.[note: 12] Subsequently, when he arrived at the KPT Unit in the evening, Lokman received a telephone call from Mubin, instructing him to deliver one of the bundles to Edy.[note: 13] Lokman acted on these instructions, packing A1E1A and A1F1A into two separate bags, then placing them into his black bag.[note: 14] These were the bundles carried by Lokman in his black bag at the time of his arrest.",
      "17": "Mubin, on the other hand, denied giving any instructions to Lokman. He denied any knowledge of the drugs found on Lokman or within the KPT Unit. He claimed that he was simply a moderate consumer of \u201cice\u201d (methamphetamine) and Zaini supplied him only ice.[note: 15] Mubin contended that he was not living at the KPT Unit at the time of Lokman\u2019s arrest and he did not leave any drugs there.[note: 16] He only stayed at the KPT Unit from around April to June 2015, after which he moved to Soho Life at Joo Chiat. [note: 17] In the middle of July 2015, Lokman moved into the KPT Unit on Mubin\u2019s invitation.[note: 18] In late July, Mubin then moved into the Holland Close Flat.[note: 19] In August, Tihani and her son moved into the KPT Unit.[note: 20] Mubin contended that Lokman falsely implicated him because of the brothers\u2019 rivalry over the affections of his former wife Hasina Begum binte Glum Hussin Mullah (\u201cHasina\u201d) and in order to escape the death penalty.[note: 21]",
      "18": "The two brothers\u2019 defences, therefore, contradicted each other and were mutually exclusive. Lokman\u2019s version of events dovetailed with the case advanced by the Prosecution. If Lokman\u2019s version was accepted, Lokman would be a courier in possession of the bundles of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking and Mubin would be the instigator of the act of trafficking. On the other hand, if Mubin\u2019s version was accepted, Lokman would be the trafficker, and Mubin a mere consumer of ice. This factual dispute was the main issue of contention at trial and affected the case against both brothers. I therefore deal with this central factual issue first.",
      "19": "The Prosecution\u2019s contention that Mubin was responsible for planning the drug movements and Lokman was his \u201crunner\u201d was based on the following:\n(a)     the evidence of the drug suppliers and call logs involving Zaini;\n(b)     recordings of telephone conversations between Lokman and Mubin and between Lokman and Edy, and call logs involving Mubin and Edy; and\n(c)     Lokman\u2019s testimony.",
      "20": "I deal with the evidence of the suppliers first.",
      "21": "It was not disputed that the two bundles of diamorphine found on Lokman at the time of his arrest came from the KPT Unit. It was also not disputed by Lokman that the bundles were supplied by Zaini and Noor. Mubin, however, contended he had no knowledge of the source or existence of the diamorphine.",
      "22": "Zaini and Noor, the alleged suppliers of the diamorphine to Mubin, were arrested in a separate operation by the CNB on 11 September 2015. They were dealt with earlier in a separate High Court trial.",
      "23": "In order to link Zaini and Noor to A1E1A and A1F1A, the Prosecution led forensic evidence in the form of an analysis conducted by Lim Shing Min, who prepared a report bearing Lab No FC-1541-00165-A under s 263 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d) (marked as P248).[note: 22] According to the report, the physical characteristics of the four plastic bags used in A1E1A and A1F1A and those used for drugs seized during Zaini\u2019s arrest showed that they were likely to have been manufactured by the same machine. The report also stated that the heat seals put onto the bags after the powdery substances were packed suggested they had been sealed by the same heat sealer. This was undisputed evidence but not definitive of the source of the drugs.",
      "24": "Zaini was called by the Prosecution to establish that he had supplied A1E1A and A1F1A to Mubin by driving them from Malaysia into Singapore using his car. He was accompanied on these trips by Noor, who was called as a witness by Mr Muzzamil on behalf of Lokman. Zaini identified the bundles as similar to those he supplied. When asked to identify the bundles that he delivered, Zaini pointed to the bundles photographed in P48 and P50 showing A1E1 and A1F1 respectively.[note: 23] Further, these were wrapped in black tape as he usually wrapped them and secured with double-sided tape in a manner which enabled him to secure the bundles in the boot of his car when bringing them into Singapore. The marks of such tape were visually identifiable on A1F1 as shown in P50.[note: 24] A1E1 and A1F1 were therefore typical of bundles delivered by Zaini.",
      "25": "Records from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (\u201cICA\u201d) showed that Zaini entered Singapore on 1, 5 and 7 September 2015. Further, shortly after each entry, telephone calls were made first between Zaini and Mubin, then between Mubin and Lokman.[note: 25] It was not disputed that Zaini and Noor went to the KPT Unit on 1, 5 and 7 September 2015.[note: 26] What was unclear was the specific date on which these two particular bundles of diamorphine were supplied. I deal with each date in turn.",
      "26": "All parties accept that a delivery occurred on 7 September 2015. In summary, at around 12.18am, Zaini and Noor entered Singapore and called Mubin at around 12.24am. Two more telephone calls were made at 12.50am and 12.51am to inform Mubin that they had reached MBS. Mubin rode pillion on Lokman\u2019s motorcycle to meet them at MBS. At MBS, Mubin got off Lokman\u2019s motorcycle and boarded Zaini\u2019s car as Zaini drove out of the MBS carpark. Mubin sat in the rear passenger seat, while Zaini was in the driver\u2019s seat and Noor was in the front passenger seat. Two bundles wrapped in black tape were passed to Mubin in the car. On the way to the KPT Unit, Lokman\u2019s motorcycle ran out of petrol and he was stranded near Kallang Stadium. Zaini, Noor, and Mubin retrieved a container from the KPT carpark and went to purchase petrol for Lokman. After passing the petrol to Lokman, the three then went back to the KPT Unit while Lokman went to refuel at a petrol station. Zaini, Noor, and Mubin then consumed \u201cice\u201d in the KPT Unit, after which they were joined by Lokman. Zaini, Noor, and Mubin then went to eat at Geylang Serai, and Lokman left the KPT Unit soon after to meet up with them.",
      "27": "The dispute arises as to the nature and quantity of the drugs that were in the two bundles supplied in the car that night. Zaini recounted that he delivered two 25g bundles of \u201cice\u201d and passed the bundles to Mubin in the car on the way from MBS to KPT. Noor\u2019s evidence was that he heard Zaini tell Mubin that there were \u201ctwo batu\u201d which had been placed on the rear seat, but admitted that he did not know for a fact what drugs were delivered. As I will explain below at [45], \u201cbatu\u201d is the street name for a pound of heroin, which is equivalent to approximately 440g to 450g. Mubin contended, instead, that he received two 25g bundles of \u201cice\u201d.",
      "28": "In Lokman\u2019s contemporaneous statement recorded on 9 September 2015, which he later sought to renege, Lokman was asked at Question 17, \u201cWhen did you collect the two bundles of heroin?\u201d Lokman replied, \u201cOn Monday, 7th September 2015\u201d. At Question 19, he was asked, \u201cWho instructed you to collect the two bundles of heroin?\u201d He replied, \u201cMy brother Mubin instructed me on Monday night to collect the heroin from one male Malaysian and pass it to Edy.\u201d In his statement recorded on 16 September 2015, however, Lokman said he only dropped Mubin off at the entrance of MBS on 7 September 2015.[note: 27] In light of Zaini\u2019s and Noor\u2019s testimony, I decided not to give weight to Lokman\u2019s contemporaneous statement that he collected the drugs instead of Mubin. Even on Mubin\u2019s own case, he had met with Zaini and Noor and sat in Zaini\u2019s car.",
      "29": "In addition, the witnesses gave differing accounts as to whether and, if so, how much money was given to Zaini by Mubin. Zaini claimed that he did not receive money from Mubin on any delivery.[note: 28] By contrast, at trial Noor claimed to have seen Zaini receive $5,000 from Mubin at the KPT Unit.[note: 29] Mubin admitted that he passed Zaini money, but claimed that it was only $3,500: $2,800 was for the two bundles he received on 7 September 2015, while $700 was the balance due for the bundle he received on 5 September 2015.",
      "30": "The Prosecution did not contend that the two bundles of diamorphine were delivered on 7 September 2015 but adopted Zaini\u2019s version that they were delivered on 5 September 2015. Zaini was quite certain that he had only delivered bundles weighing around 25g of ice each on 7 September 2015 and the Prosecution was not able to elicit any explanation for this claim in re-examination.[note: 30] Bundles each containing a batu of diamorphine would have been significantly heavier, weighing around 450g. I turn therefore to the evidence concerning the 5 September 2015 delivery.",
      "31": "On 5 September 2015, Zaini and Noor arrived in Singapore at 2.48pm. Zaini made a series of calls and was instructed by Mubin to go to Meyer Road, where Lokman would meet him and bring him to KPT. There, Lokman met with Zaini and Noor and brought them to KPT, where they went to the carpark. At this point, the accounts diverged:\n(a)     Zaini claimed that he passed two bundles of heroin to Lokman at the carpark. However, under cross-examination, he admitted that he was not sure if he was the one who passed the bundles to Lokman, claiming that he could not remember the details but remembered that there were two bundles.[note: 31] He then claimed that he had passed the drugs to Noor who then passed them to Lokman.[note: 32] Zaini had brought some \u201cice\u201d in a shoe bag for his own consumption and passed this shoe bag to Noor to carry. When they got to the KPT Unit, they met Mubin and smoked \u201cice\u201d together. Lokman then went up to the KPT Unit and passed the two bundles to Mubin.\n(b)     Noor initially testified that Zaini had passed him a \u201cshoe box\u201d containing \u201cice\u201d and drug-taking utensils to bring to the KPT Unit. There, he passed it to Zaini who then passed it to Mubin. However, after his memory was refreshed by his prior statement under s 161 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cEvidence Act\u201d), Noor confirmed that he saw Zaini take two bundles from his car and put it into a black shoe bag. Zaini then passed this black shoe bag to Noor, who carried it up to the KPT Unit.[note: 33] There, Zaini took the bag back and passed it to Mubin. This statement was admitted into evidence under s 147(4) and s 147(5) of the Evidence Act and marked P299. Noor also said in the same statement that $5,000 was handed to Zaini by Mubin on 5 September 2015.\n(c)     Lokman claimed that he did not see any bundles but saw Noor carrying a bag. On his account, he did not receive anything from Zaini or Noor. They went up the elevator to the KPT Unit first and he only went up after. When he entered, he saw them talking to each other and smoking \u201cice\u201d.\n(d)     Mubin claimed that he only received 25g of \u201cice\u201d from Zaini on this occasion, in the form of a small black bundle. Zaini passed him this bundle and then they smoked \u201cice\u201d together.",
      "32": "In my judgment, the evidence was clear on the following facts. First, arrangements were made for Zaini to deliver two bundles to Mubin. Second, two bundles were delivered to Mubin. Although the testimonies were inconsistent on whether the bundles were first given to Lokman, it was clear that Lokman was not the final recipient of the drugs. Even if Lokman had taken the bundles, as in Zaini\u2019s account, Lokman eventually handed them to Mubin in the KPT Unit. Furthermore, the inconsistencies could be explained by the inaccuracy of human recollection arising from the passage of time.",
      "33": "Mubin\u2019s account that he only received a single 25g bundle of \u201cice\u201d on this occasion is clearly contradicted by the evidence of Zaini and Noor. At no point in any other person\u2019s evidence was the possibility of only one bundle being delivered raised. The consistent evidence was that two bundles were given to Mubin, either through Lokman or directly. Therefore, I concluded that Zaini and Noor delivered two bundles to Mubin on 5 September 2015.",
      "34": "ICA records showed that Zaini and Noor entered Singapore on 1 September 2015 at 7.40am. Subsequently, Zaini placed two telephone calls to Mubin at 8.52am and 8.54am. KPT\u2019s records showed Zaini\u2019s car entering at 9.12am. The car then exited at 11.10am.",
      "35": "In court, Zaini was unable to recall the events of 1 September 2015.[note: 34] Similarly, neither could Noor.[note: 35] Prosecution submitted in closing that there were three delivery occasions (1, 5 and 7 September 2015) and adopted Zaini\u2019s evidence concerning the events on 5 and 7 September 2015.[note: 36] The other witnesses did not provide an account of what happened on 1 September 2015. Therefore, I did not find it appropriate to make any findings on events occurring on 1 September 2015.",
      "36": "Zaini and Noor consistently maintained that they only dealt with Mubin and not Lokman. Their only other customer was one Mutaleb,[note: 37] who was tried with Zaini and Noor in their High Court trial. Lokman\u2019s phone number was not found on any of Zaini\u2019s phones, whereas Mubin\u2019s phone number was found on all three of Zaini\u2019s phones.[note: 38] The pattern of calls surrounding each delivery showed clearly that it was only Mubin who dealt directly with Zaini and Noor. There was no basis for concluding that Lokman ordered the bundles and had them delivered by Zaini and Noor. Mubin himself did not assert that any bundles were delivered to Lokman nor did he contest the fact that he received deliveries from Zaini and Noor on 1, 5 and 7 September 2015. His claim was only that he had received methamphetamine, and the bundles of diamorphine were not his. It was clear that of the two brothers, Mubin was the recipient. It was also clear that he received at least two bundles of diamorphine.",
      "37": "There were three occasions on which drugs were supplied in this case. Taking into account that the trial was four years after the fact, truthful witnesses could be expected to experience some difficulty in recollecting details. On the evidence at hand, I found it beyond a reasonable doubt that the bundles containing A1E1A and A1F1A were supplied on 5 September 2015. Zaini identified the bundles as typical of shipments originating from him, was clear about the delivery occasion, and there was no other source of supply alleged or any facts raising a suspicion otherwise. Further, the only conclusion to be drawn from the facts surrounding the supply of the diamorphine was that, consistent with Lokman\u2019s case, Mubin dealt with Zaini and made the arrangements for the drug supply and delivery. While Mr Goswami put his case to Lokman that he was running his own drug trafficking operation from the KPT Unit, this was simply an assertion without any explanation as to his processes or methods, and without any evidence to suggest that it was true. Conversely, the evidence indicated that Lokman was working under Mubin\u2019s instruction as his errand boy. I turn to this part of the evidence now.",
      "38": "Lokman maintained throughout the investigations and the trial that he was acting on Mubin\u2019s instructions when he went to the KPT Unit to pick up the drugs. At trial, the gist of his account was as follows. On the afternoon of 8 September 2015, he received a call from Mubin asking him to return to the Holland Close Flat. When he did so, he received instructions from Mubin to retrieve the drugs from the KPT Unit, specifically, two bundles of heroin and any other drugs that remained.[note: 39] Mubin then asked him to bring all the drugs back to the Holland Close Flat.[note: 40] Later that day, when he arrived at the KPT Unit, Lokman received a telephone call from Mubin, instructing him to deliver one of the bundles to Edy.[note: 41] Lokman acted on these instructions, packing A1E1A and A1F1A into two separate bags, then placing them into his black bag, with the intention to first meet Edy to deliver one bundle, and then to return to the Holland Close flat with the remainder.[note: 42]",
      "39": "Mubin gave the following account of the events of 8 September 2015. He and his former wife Hasina had gone out in the morning and returned to the Holland Close Flat at around 4pm in the afternoon. At that time, they saw Lokman sleeping in the living room. Mubin and Hasina then went to their room where they slept.[note: 43] At around 6pm, Mubin woke up and saw that Lokman was awake and preparing to go out. He saw Hasina and Lokman in the living room and, while he was in the toilet showering, heard Lokman tell him that he was going out to meet his friend. Lokman then left at around 7.15pm. Hasina also told Mubin that Lokman was going to Beach Road. As he expected Lokman to return to the Holland Close Flat afterwards, Mubin called Lokman at around 9.15pm and asked him to buy some food.[note: 44] For this, Mubin referred to the call logs for his phone number, and pointed to the call placed at 9.13pm.[note: 45] Lokman agreed to do so. Mubin denied giving Lokman any instructions as to the bundles in the KPT Unit, claiming that he did not even know about the existence of those drugs.[note: 46]",
      "40": "That night, however, Lokman did not return to the Holland Close Flat. At around 11pm, Mubin called Lokman again but could not reach him. At around 11.06pm, Mubin therefore called Edy to ask about Lokman\u2019s whereabouts.[note: 47] Edy told Mubin that he was also waiting for Lokman to pass him something, which Mubin thought was a reference to contraband cigarettes.[note: 48] He called Edy later again, and Edy said that he had not managed to find Lokman. Mubin explained that he was concerned to find Lokman \u201c[b]ecause he had promised [him] that he\u2019ll come home and buy food for [them]\u201d.[note: 49] Mubin claimed that he called Edy because he knew that Lokman had gone to Beach Road to meet a friend and he was introduced to Edy by Lokman at Beach Road.[note: 50]",
      "41": "Lokman\u2019s account is supported by the evidence of telephone calls and recordings after his arrest, which I now explain.",
      "42": "In the period when Lokman was uncontactable after arrest, there was a call from Mubin to Edy at 11.12pm,[note: 51] followed by numerous missed calls from Edy to Lokman between 11.12pm and 11.44pm on 8 September 2015.[note: 52] After that series of missed calls, Edy called Mubin at 11.45pm.[note: 53] At 12.15am on 9 September 2015, Mubin called Edy.[note: 54] These calls, which were not disputed, supported Lokman\u2019s evidence that Edy was waiting for a delivery, and that Edy sought Mubin\u2019s assistance when Lokman failed to turn up and return his calls.",
      "43": "After Lokman\u2019s arrest, he placed and received calls to and from Edy and Mubin between 12.25am and 4.20am on 9 September 2015. These recorded calls provide cogent evidence that Lokman was acting under Mubin\u2019s instructions to pass one bundle of drugs to Edy and to return the remaining bundle to Mubin. Of relevance were the following calls involving Edy:\n(a)     A call from Lokman to Edy at 12.29am.[note: 55] From the conversation, it was clear that there had been a prior plan for them to meet up. Most of the conversation was an attempt by both sides to fix a meeting place and time.[note: 56]\n(b)     A second call made by Lokman to Edy at 12.46am.[note: 57] Both parties continued to make efforts to meet with each other. Edy ended the conversation by saying that he was waiting for a friend and that he would contact Lokman when the friend arrived.[note: 58]\n(c)     A third call made by Lokman to Edy at 1.45am,[note: 59] in which Lokman asked Edy where he was, and Edy replied that his friend \u201chas taken from another place\u201d as he had waited too long. Edy asked Lokman, \u201cCan I take it tomorrow?\u201d Both parties arranged to meet the next day.[note: 60]\n(d)     A call from Edy to Lokman at 1.47am, in which Lokman told Edy that he wanted to meet soon, but Edy said that he could only meet in the afternoon (referring to 9 September 2015). Lokman then said, \u201cAh, why, why cannot make it? Because I\u2019ve already brought along this stuff. If not where I want to keep this stuff.\u201d[note: 61] Edy mentioned that he did not have cash, even if he could take delivery that day.[note: 62] They continued to make arrangements for Edy to take delivery.\n(e)     A call made by Edy to Lokman at 2.28am.[note: 63] Edy told Lokman that Mubin had called him asking if they had met up.[note: 64] Edy relayed his conversation with Mubin, saying that he had told Mubin that his friend had left, and Mubin then asked Edy if Lokman was okay. Edy asked Lokman to call Mubin directly. Lokman asked Edy if he wanted to take \u201cit\u201d. Edy replied, \u201cYou should call your brother but for now I tell you frankly, my friend had taken it from another source.\u201d[note: 65] Edy ended the conversation by saying that Mubin appeared concerned for Lokman\u2019s \u201csafety\u201d.[note: 66]",
      "44": "These interactions between the brothers and Edy supported the following conclusions:\n(a)     First, as between Lokman and Edy, there was a prior arrangement for them to meet up in order for Lokman to pass Edy a delivery. This delivery was sufficiently important for them to attempt to arrange delivery multiple times. This supported Lokman\u2019s evidence that he was to deliver a bundle of diamorphine to Edy.\n(b)     Second, as between Edy and Mubin, it was also clear that there was a prior arrangement between the two men. They sought each other out when Lokman was uncontactable, and again when Lokman became contactable. In his conversation with Lokman, Edy also referenced Mubin\u2019s concern regarding Lokman\u2019s safety. Based on Edy\u2019s account of his conversation with Mubin, it appeared that Mubin knew that Edy was supposed to receive a delivery from Lokman. This supported Lokman\u2019s evidence that his planned delivery to Edy was arranged by Mubin.",
      "45": "Lokman then called Mubin at 2.42am.[note: 67] When Lokman reported that Edy could not make it, Mubin replied, \u201cHan called me till they said cancelled already.\u201d Mubin then scolded Lokman for failing to meet the timings.[note: 68] The transcript records a number of key comments made by Mubin. I note that Mubin testified that he knew Edy as \u201cRudy\u201d/\u201cRudi\u201d; references to \u201cRudi\u201d below are references to Edy.[note: 69] Mubin\u2019s pertinent statements were as follows:\n(a)     At S/N 7: \u201cAyi called me, I called Rudi, none had progressed. Why is that so? Why not carried out? That\u2019s why I tell you, you\u2019re difficult (inaudible)?\u201d\n(b)     At S/N 9: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that you\u2019re carrying so much of the stuff.\u201d [note: 70]\n(c)     At S/N 10: \u201cAyi had also called to ask whether you\u2019re coming or not? Huh, you didn\u2019t send it? Rudi called saying that you asked him to go to Buona Vista, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n(d)     At S/N 12: \u201cThen how? Do you want to work? How did it turn out like this? Do you know how it happened? You didn\u2019t follow instructions.\u201d",
      "46": "An exchange at S/N 13 was particularly relevant:",
      "47": "The emphasised phrase was translated from the Malay phrase, \u201csatu batu habis\u201d. Mubin attempted to explain that this phrase meant \u201chard-headed, meaning he\u2019s stubborn\u201d.[note: 71] He interpreted \u201chabis\u201d to mean \u201cextreme\u201d, while \u201cbatu\u201d meant \u201cstone\u201d, referring to Lokman as \u201chard-headed\u201d. There were several issues with such an interpretation. First, as Mubin acknowledged in cross-examination, the phrase for \u201chard-headed\u201d was \u201ckepala batu\u201d.[note: 72] He did not explain why the use of \u201cbatu\u201d on its own here would carry the same meaning. Second, that interpretation did not fit the context. Prior to S/N 13, Mubin was castigating Lokman for not following instructions. Just after, Lokman said he did not know what to do, and Mubin replied, \u201cYou deliver.\u201d Given the overall context in which this exchange took place, I find that \u201cbatu\u201d, which is the street name for a pound of heroin, referred to the planned delivery to Edy. ASP Yang Rongluan gave evidence that \u201cbatu\u201d is often used as a term of measurement for heroin, referring to approximately 440g to 450g of heroin.[note: 73] Lokman similarly acknowledged that in his understanding, one \u201cbatu\u201d was one bundle of heroin[note: 74] and he had understood Mubin to be referring to heroin.[note: 75]",
      "48": "Mubin then alluded to his expectation that Lokman would return with the rest of the drugs to where Mubin was staying:\n(a)     At S/N 20: \u201cYou tell me frankly. I\u2019m worried that you kept quiet. I\u2019m worried about you, you promised to come home.\u201d\n(b)     At S/N 21: \u201cI also don\u2019t want to be bothered, I\u2019m not bothered about other things, I\u2019m concerned about your safety, duh, waiting for stuff in the middle of the night (inaudible). We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. You didn\u2019t want to answer our calls (inaudible).\u201d\n(c)     At S/N 26: \u201cI want to cover your safety and all. In the middle of the night you want to deliver it. I\u2019m telling you that you had done it during the day, there won\u2019t be any problems you know.\u201d",
      "49": "The ensuing conversation was not material to the present case. Mubin appeared to understand from Lokman\u2019s answers that Lokman had been arrested. With the assistance of a court interpreter in the course of trial, it was clarified that at S/N 38 Mubin stated \u201ckau kena tangkap\u201d, meaning \u201cyou were arrested\u201d.[note: 76] The conversation tailed off meaninglessly thereafter. It appeared at trial that Staff Sergeant Rasshidy bin Roslan, who had charge of the telephone investigation, had not heard the comment by Mubin. Under his direction, Lokman telephoned Mubin again at 4.01am.[note: 77] Most of this conversation was not material. Lokman\u2019s statements were rather aimless, and Mubin reiterated at S/N 54 \u201cKau kena tang\u201d, meaning \u201cyou were arrested\u201d (tang being shorthand for tangkap).[note: 78]",
      "50": "Mubin\u2019s attempt to explain these telephone calls was not persuasive. Mubin contended that he called Edy multiple times because he associated Edy with Beach Road and thought that Lokman was going to Beach Road to meet a friend. This entirely failed to explain why, out of all of Lokman\u2019s friends, Mubin should single out Edy. This was also inconsistent with the recording where Mubin told Lokman, \u201cAyi called me, I called Rudi, none had progressed. Why is that so? Why not carried out?\u201d[note: 79] Clearly, his call to Edy was intended to check on the progress of the delivery. Edy said the same in his account to Lokman of his call with Mubin, where he alluded to Mubin\u2019s expectation that Edy would take delivery from Lokman.",
      "51": "Mubin\u2019s conversation with Lokman entirely derailed Mubin\u2019s evidence on the stand that he was simply waiting for Lokman to return home with food. There was no mention at all of food in the telephone conversations. Instead, it was plain from the conversations that Mubin had given Lokman instructions to make a delivery to Edy and then return to where Mubin was staying, which was the Holland Close Flat. He was clearly furious that Lokman had not been punctual and had thereby missed his delivery of a pound of heroin to Edy. According to Mubin, Lokman was always tardy and Mubin wanted to scold Lokman for being ill-disciplined.[note: 80] He was aware that Lokman was carrying \u201cstuff\u201d and was concerned. Mubin claimed at trial that he was only referring to contraband cigarettes.[note: 81] However, the brothers did not deal in contraband cigarettes. Therefore, I concluded that the telephone call recordings significantly buttressed the Prosecution\u2019s case against Mubin, and established that Mubin was in control and had given instructions to Lokman to retrieve the bundles and deliver one to Edy and bring the other to himself that night.",
      "52": "I come to the issue of the reliability of Lokman\u2019s evidence. In so doing, I note that his testimony was corroborated by several important independent witnesses and pieces of evidence. For example:\n(a)     Lokman\u2019s assertion that he had received a Samsung mobile phone (marked L-HP1) from Mubin to conduct drug-related activities[note: 82] was corroborated by Tihani.[note: 83]\n(b)     Zaini\u2019s and Noor\u2019s testimony corroborated Lokman\u2019s account of his role in Mubin\u2019s drug operation, and also largely corroborated Lokman\u2019s account of what happened during these deliveries. The call logs between Zaini and Mubin and between Mubin and Lokman were consistent with supply arrangements being made by Mubin with Zaini, with Lokman in a supporting role.\n(c)     The telephone call logs and recordings involving Edy corroborated Lokman\u2019s account that he was going to meet with Edy, and that he was acting under Mubin\u2019s instructions.\n(d)     The call logs showed that Lokman received a call from Mubin at around 9.13pm on 8 September 2015, corroborating his claim that Mubin called him when he was at the KPT Unit to give instructions. While Mubin attempted to explain this call as an instruction to buy food, I have explained why Mubin\u2019s account was not credible. The first conversation with Mubin confirmed Lokman\u2019s account.",
      "53": "I turn then to deal with various contentions made by Mr Goswami.",
      "54": "At trial, Mr Goswami on behalf of Mubin sought to admit Lokman\u2019s contemporaneous statement under s 258(1) of the CPC, largely in order to discredit Lokman. Lokman contested the voluntariness of the statement under s 258(3) of the CPC. An ancillary hearing was held on the issue of admissibility. Lokman argued that he suffered physical injury because of the arrest, he had been experiencing the after-effects of consuming drugs before the arrest, and he was pestered and pressured into giving the statement. In Mr Muzzamil\u2019s submission, this amounted to oppression under s 258(3) of the CPC.[note: 84]",
      "55": "In my judgment, there was no evidence of any threat, inducement, or promise that would render the statement inadmissible. Further, there was no evidence that Lokman was suffering from withdrawal symptoms to such an extent that the statement should not be admitted. Indeed, the surrounding evidence of the recorded telephone calls (which I have dealt with above), the statement itself, and the testimony of other witnesses indicated that Lokman was lucid. Therefore, I found that the voluntariness of the statement was proved beyond a reasonable doubt and admitted the statement.",
      "56": "There were inconsistencies between the contemporaneous statement and Lokman\u2019s evidence at trial but these did not detract from the credibility of his evidence. First, his contemporaneous statement that he had collected the bundles on 7 September 2015 was contrary to his evidence at trial. However, his evidence at trial was supported by Zaini and Noor, whose accounts I believed. Second, there were also inconsistencies in relation to whether he knew that the bundles were under the sofa when Mubin gave him instructions to retrieve them. In my view, whether he knew the bundles were there was not significant; the important issue was whether he had been given directions about them and had acted on those directions. Third, there were inconsistencies in relation to whether it was him or Mubin who unwrapped another bundle which had been wrapped in black tape. This was in relation to drugs that were not part of the subject matter of the charge. Fourth, there were inconsistencies in relation to whether he had personally delivered drugs to Edy prior to 8 September 2015 or had simply driven Mubin to meet with Edy for Mubin to make the delivery. Again, this was in relation to drugs that were not part of the subject matter of the charge.",
      "57": "Further inconsistencies within Lokman\u2019s evidence were raised, which I deal with briefly:\n(a)     In Lokman\u2019s statement marked P128, he claimed that Mubin\u2019s instructions had been given while they were both at the Holland Close Flat.[note: 85] At trial, he then claimed that he had received instructions from Mubin to collect the drugs from the KPT Unit while he was at the Holland Close Flat, and the instructions were supplemented with a direction to give one bundle of drugs to Edy by way of a telephone call when he was already at the KPT Unit.[note: 86] This was minor as it pertained to exactly when the instructions were given and whether they were given in person by Mubin, but no doubt was raised as to what instructions were ultimately communicated by Mubin.\n(b)     Lokman initially said that a black pouch containing packets of diamorphine found in the KPT Unit (marked E1), belonged to Mubin[note: 87] and that he had taken three packets out of E1 to repack them in clear plastic bags.[note: 88] At trial, he then said that he did not know who owned E1[note: 89] and that he had not handled or removed anything from E1 on 8 September 2015.[note: 90] This inconsistency is again not material as the drugs did not form the subject matter of the charge. Moreover, Lokman eventually revised his testimony in court and clarified that he had confused E1 with A1. [note: 91]\n(c)     Lokman initially testified that Mubin packed drugs from another bundle into straws,[note: 92] but later claimed that Mubin packed them into packets.[note: 93] This did not appear to be an inconsistency but was simply an ambiguity in his use of terms.\n(d)     Lokman apparently admitted to ownership of the two bundles of heroin to CNB officers when he was arrested. For this, Mr Goswami cited the police report bearing Report No D/20150909/2022,[note: 94] which records:\nHowever, it was not clear what exactly was said, specifically, what was asked of Lokman and what \u201cowned\u201d meant in that context. I did not find it appropriate to give weight to this alleged admission recorded in the police report.\n(e)     Lokman appeared to claim in his statement recorded on 15 September 2015 (marked P129) that Mubin owed him money. [note: 95] However, in a subsequent statement recorded on 18 September 2015 (marked P131),[note: 96] he said that Mubin did not owe him money. When asked for an explanation at trial, Lokman explained that it depended on whether he considered the discounts that Mubin had given him when he bought drugs from Mubin. Such discounts would offset any debt that Mubin had incurred.[note: 97] This was a minor inconsistency and I found that Lokman provided a sufficiently reasonable explanation.",
      "58": "In my view, it was realistic to expect Lokman to attempt to distance himself from the drugs. This, together with a lack of precision in Lokman\u2019s recollection, accounted for the inconsistencies. He was, nevertheless, consistent throughout the various accounts regarding his relationship with Mubin, his actions on 8 September 2015, and Mubin\u2019s instructions to him:\n(a)     In Lokman\u2019s contemporaneous statement recorded on 9 September 2015 (exhibit 2D5), Lokman stated that Mubin instructed him to collect the bundles from the KPT Unit and pass them to Edy.\n(b)     In his statement recorded on 10 September 2015 (exhibit P127), Lokman stated that Mubin passed him two \u201cpanas\u201d bundles (referring to heroin) \u201cand asked [him] to deliver\u201d.[note: 98]\n(c)     In his statement recorded on 15 September 2015 (exhibit P128), Lokman stated that Mubin asked him to go to the KPT Unit to retrieve the two heroin bundles and other drugs. He was also told to deliver one bundle to Edy and bring the remaining drugs to the Holland Close Flat.[note: 99]\n(d)     At trial, Lokman\u2019s testimony was consistent with the above accounts in stating that first, Mubin asked him to go to the KPT Unit to retrieve the drugs, and second, one of the bundles was (at some point) designated for Edy while the remaining drugs were to be brought to the Holland Close Flat.",
      "59": "Three arguments regarding the consistency of Lokman\u2019s evidence with external events were raised. First, the call logs did not support Lokman\u2019s claim that he received a telephone call from Mubin at around 1pm, during which Mubin asked Lokman to meet him, as a result of which Lokman went to the Holland Close Flat.[note: 100] While it was accepted that the call logs of Lokman\u2019s and Mubin\u2019s known phone numbers did not reflect a call from Mubin to Lokman at around 1pm on 8 September 2015, the evidence indicated that Mubin used several phones. It also appeared from their telephone conversation the night of Lokman\u2019s arrest that Mubin had given Lokman the instruction sometime before the evening. Mubin, after castigating Lokman about punctuality earlier in the conversation, stated, \"I\u2019m telling you that if you had done it during the day, there won\u2019t be any problems you know\u201d.[note: 101]",
      "60": "Second, the DNA evidence contradicted Lokman\u2019s account in relation to a piece of clear plastic wrapped in black tape found in the dustbin in the KPT Unit (exhibit C1). The DNA analysis showed that Lokman\u2019s DNA was found on the interior and exterior surfaces of the tape bundle, both the sticky and non-sticky sides of the tape, as well as the plastic bag of exhibit C1.[note: 102] This was coupled with inconsistencies in his evidence. In his long statement (P128), Lokman claimed that Mubin had cut open a bundle of drugs to repack them, and threw the wrapping (C1) into the dustbin. However, in his contemporaneous statement (2D5), Lokman said that he was the one who had unwrapped the bundle and repacked it. When cross-examined on this issue, Lokman claimed that his DNA was found on C1 because he had touched it when clearing the rubbish,[note: 103] or because he had scraped some remnants of heroin off of C1.[note: 104] However, he also acknowledged the possibility that he had helped Mubin repack those drugs.[note: 105] As such, Lokman appeared to give different explanations for the fact that his DNA was on C1, and his statements differed as to who unpacked C1. When faced at trial with his contemporaneous statement, Lokman could only repeat that he rejected its contents because he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms at the time.[note: 106]",
      "61": "I accepted there was inconsistency on this issue, but found it was explained by Lokman\u2019s desire to distance himself from acts that would indicate he was anything other than a courier. This issue, further, related only to an exhibit, C1, which was not the subject matter of any of the charges. More importantly, even if Lokman had unpacked C1, this did not detract from the evidence on the central factual issue as I have defined it. Lokman himself admitted that he would pack drugs if Mubin asked him to.[note: 107] It was not inconsistent with Lokman\u2019s account of their respective roles.",
      "62": "Third, Lokman claimed for the first time at trial that Tihani had told him in the CNB Exhibit Management Room that the drugs were Mubin\u2019s and that he should not \u201ctake the rap\u201d.[note: 108] Tihani, called as a witness, denied having said that to Lokman.[note: 109] Lokman himself previously claimed in P129 that Tihani did not know anything about the drugs from the KPT Unit.[note: 110] When asked to explain the inconsistency between his testimony at trial and his earlier assertion that Tihani had no knowledge of the drug activities, Lokman claimed that the latter had been his assumption which was dispelled when Tihani spoke to him in the CNB Exhibit Management Room.[note: 111] When it was pointed out to Lokman that P129 was recorded after Lokman and Tihani were in the CNB Exhibit Management Room, he then claimed he only meant that Tihani did not know the quantities of the drugs involved.[note: 112] This, however, was inconsistent with the language of P129, which stated, \u201cI want to say that [Tihani] has got nothing to do with the drugs found in the flat.\u201d[note: 113]",
      "63": "This inconsistency was neither here nor there. I would expect that Lokman would try to distance himself from the drugs; at the same time, I would also expect that Tihani might be averse to giving evidence adverse to Mubin. This inconsistency was not relevant to any issue of significance and neither added to nor detracted from Lokman\u2019s evidence about the central factual issue.",
      "64": "Mr Goswami argued that Lokman had two motives to falsely implicate Mubin. First, Lokman gave false evidence because he wanted to get back at Mubin over a sibling rivalry for Hasina\u2019s affections. Second, Lokman was vying for a Certificate of Substantive Assistance (\u201cCSA\u201d) to avoid the mandatory death penalty.",
      "65": "Regarding Hasina, Mubin testified that his relationship with Hasina was getting better and they were \u201cin the process of patching up\u201d.[note: 114] He alleged that Lokman had feelings for Hasina and treated her like his girlfriend. Because Mubin and Hasina were reconciling, Lokman was therefore jealous and had motive to implicate Mubin.[note: 115] However, Hasina was subpoenaed by the Prosecution and gave evidence that there were no plans for reconciliation,[note: 116] and neither was Lokman vying for her affections.[note: 117] Therefore, there was no factual basis for this alleged motive to lie.",
      "66": "As for the CSA, common sense dictates that the possibility of avoiding the mandatory death penalty through s 33B(2) of the MDA might motivate a co-accused to falsely implicate another. The Court of Appeal recognised this reality in Norasharee bin Gous v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and another matter [2017] 1 SLR 820 (\u201cNorasharee\u201d) at [68]. Contrary to the Prosecution\u2019s submissions, I did not think it was necessary for an accused to prove that a co-accused who is implicating him is motivated by the desire to obtain a CSA. Nevertheless, the existence of that incentive does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that the witness is lying. A witness who has an incentive to lie may be telling the truth, just as a witness without any incentive may still be lying: Norasharee at [59]. Hence, if it can be shown that the testimony of a co-accused is consistent and corroborated by objective evidence, the court is entitled to give even full weight to that co-accused\u2019s testimony: see Public Prosecutor v Mohd Zaini bin Zainutdin and others [2019] SGHC 162 at [49]. This was my conclusion in the case at hand.",
      "67": "In contrast, I found Mubin\u2019s account of what happened on 8 September 2015 to be unbelievable. First, he was unable to obtain any corroboration from Hasina, who denied being with Mubin on 8 September 2015.[note: 118] Second, Mubin\u2019s account at trial directly contradicted his statement recorded on 20 October 2015. In his statement, Mubin stated, \u201cI am now asked if I recall where I was on 8 September 2015. I can\u2019t recall where I was. It was too long ago.\u201d[note: 119] This was just over a month after the events of 8 September 2015. Yet, almost four years after this statement was recorded, Mubin was apparently able to provide a detailed account of what happened on 8 September 2015. Thus, I concluded that his account was not credible.",
      "68": "The evidence above established that Mubin orchestrated the drug business, while Lokman acted under his instructions. In brief:\n(a)     Mubin ordered the drugs, was notified when Zaini and Noor came to Singapore, co-ordinated the deliveries of drugs with Zaini and Noor, and received delivery from Zaini and Noor;\n(b)     Mubin then kept the drugs in the KPT Unit;\n(c)     Mubin instructed Lokman to retrieve the bundles of drugs from the KPT Unit; and\n(d)     Mubin instructed Lokman to deliver one bundle to Edy and to return the remaining bundle to himself at the Holland Close Flat.",
      "69": "The elements of possession and knowledge were not contested by Lokman. As for the purpose of trafficking, Lokman accepted that he had possession of the drugs for the purpose of passing one of the bundles to Edy, and the other to Mubin.[note: 120] This was also the Prosecution\u2019s case.[note: 121] Based on his admissions and the evidence, I found that Lokman had the intention to deliver one of the bundles of drugs to Edy and the other to Mubin when he was found in possession of the bundles. In so far as the case concerned Lokman\u2019s intended act of delivery to Edy, it was clear that this would fall within the definition of trafficking in s 2 of the MDA.",
      "70": "After closing submissions were received, I asked parties to submit on the case of Ramesh a/l Perumal v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2019] 1 SLR 1003 (\u201cRamesh\u201d) in relation to the bundle of drugs intended for return to Mubin.",
      "71": "In Ramesh, one of the accused persons, Chander, had passed the drugs in question to the co-accused, Ramesh. The Court of Appeal accepted that, as a matter of fact, Ramesh only intended to return the drugs to Chander: Ramesh at [87]. Having analysed s 2 of the MDA which defines the word \u201ctraffic\u201d, the Court of Appeal held that the act of returning drugs to the person who entrusted them with the accused in the first place was not trafficking. The judgment in Ramesh was handed down after the Prosecution\u2019s case had closed. The Court of Appeal\u2019s holding at [110] was pertinent:",
      "72": "This was elaborated at [114]:",
      "73": "The issue was the act of return, which the Prosecution had put to the accused persons as the factual premise for Lokman\u2019s act of trafficking. The Prosecution submitted that Ramesh did not apply for two key reasons, which I deal with in turn. First, they argued that there was no \u201centrustment\u201d in the present case, as Mubin did not have physical possession and did not physically pass the drugs to Lokman, such that Lokman could be treated as a \u201cbailee\u201d.",
      "74": "In my view, physical possession was not critical to the concept of bailment as the Court of Appeal had defined it in Ramesh. The concept of possession in the context of drug offences was set out in Tan Ah Tee and another v Public Prosecutor [1979-1980] SLR(R) 311 at [25], where the Court of Appeal adopted Lord Pearce\u2019s approach in the case of Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 2 AC 256 (\u201cWarner\u201d). The following excerpt from Lord Pearce\u2019s judgment is most relevant to the present case (Warner at 305):",
      "75": "In this case, Mubin had purchased the drugs from Zaini. Given the illegal subject matter, he did not have a legal right to ownership (see R v Maginnis [1987] 2 WLR 765 at 771 per Lord Keith of Kinkel). Possession, as described by Lord Pearce in Warner, however, includes possession of items within one\u2019s control. Mubin had left the drugs in premises leased by him, to which he had access and control, either personally or through Lokman. This was sufficient to establish possession. He subsequently gave instructions to Lokman to retrieve them. Lokman\u2019s retrieval commenced the act of bailment as defined in this context. There was no onward distribution of the drugs in this act. In Ramesh, the Court of Appeal made clear in framing the issue at [100] that they were dealing with an accused who took custody of the drugs with the intention to return them to the person who initially entrusted him with the drugs.",
      "76": "Moad Fadzir bin Mustaffa v Public Prosecutor and other appeals [2019] SGCA 73 (\u201cFadzir\u201d) is a case in point. An argument used by the Prosecution was that Moad Fadzir, the bailee, was in physical possession of the drugs all along, while Zuraimy, the bailor, had not had sole physical possession and therefore could not have \u201cdeposited\u201d the drugs with Fadzir, and further, that Moad Fadzir was the one who had first received possession from an unknown male Indian, before he passed the drugs to Zuraimy, meaning that when Fadzir returned the drugs to Zuraimy, the overall direction of drugs was towards the end-consumer: at [79].The Court of Appeal, in rejecting the Prosecution\u2019s arguments, cautioned against \u201can overly restrictive view of the concept of \u2018bailment\u2019\u201d (Fadzir at [80]).",
      "77": "The Prosecution\u2019s second objection was that Lokman\u2019s involvement in Mubin\u2019s business went further than mere safekeeping; he assisted Mubin with the drug trafficking operations in so far as his actions were part of a larger scheme of operations that facilitated Mubin\u2019s business. As such, Lokman was not safekeeping the bundle but bringing the bundle back to Mubin for the purpose of onward distribution by Mubin.",
      "78": "The difficulty with the Prosecution's argument on these additional factors in the present case is that these did not change the nature of the act. Rather, they pointed to involvement not consonant with the offence for which Lokman was charged. The case put to the accused persons had a much simpler factual premise. The submission relied on a different characterisation of the offending act. While I recognised that a charge could be preferred for intentional aiding or for conspiracy in an appropriate case, I was of the view that it was not appropriate to frame such a fundamentally different charge against Lokman at such a late stage in the proceedings. Neither did the Prosecution seek to do so. Cross-examination of the accused persons and the taking of evidence had been conducted on the basis of the instruction to send a bundle of drugs to Edy and to return the other bundle to Mubin, with each characterised as an act of trafficking. Notwithstanding Lokman conceded to being Mubin\u2019s errand boy as part of the general context, he had not been given an opportunity to explain his state of mind in respect of his role in Mubin\u2019s wider dealings.",
      "79": "In my judgment, therefore, the charge against Lokman for possession for the purpose of trafficking was made out in respect of the bundle intended for Edy, but not in respect of the other bundle intended for Mubin. I exercised my powers under s 128(1) of the CPC to alter the charge against Lokman and to frame a new charge. The altered charge read as follows:",
      "80": "As for the other bundle intended to be returned to Mubin, I decided that the most appropriate charge was under s 8(a) of the MDA, to mirror Ramesh\u2019s charge in Ramesh. Mr Muzzamil also submitted that this should be the course of action. Therefore, the second charge against Lokman was framed as follows:",
      "81": "The charges were read and explained to Lokman on 6 February 2020: s 128(2) of the CPC. He claimed trial to the charges and confirmed that he was ready to proceed on the altered and new charges: s 129(1) of the CPC. Mr Muzzamil confirmed that he was not seeking to adduce any new evidence or to recall any witness: s 131 of the CPC. As I was of the view that proceeding immediately would not prejudice either the Prosecution or the Defence (s 129(3) of the CPC), I proceeded accordingly.",
      "82": "The elements of the two charges were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Lokman was in possession of both bundles and knew that they contained diamorphine. As for the bundle he was intending to deliver to Edy, his possession of that bundle amounted to possession for the purpose of trafficking as defined in s 2 of the MDA. As for the second charge, he was in possession of the second bundle with knowledge of its content. Therefore, I found Lokman guilty and convicted him on both charges.",
      "83": "My earlier findings meant that the Prosecution\u2019s assertions against Mubin on the charge were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In particular, I found that:\n(a)     Mubin gave instructions to Lokman to retrieve the bundles and to deliver one bundle to Edy and return the other bundle to himself at the Holland Close Flat; and\n(b)     Mubin knew that the bundles contained diamorphine and he intended for Lokman to take possession of the bundles for the purpose of passing one to Edy and the other to himself.",
      "84": "In addition, it is clear from earlier parts of these grounds of decision that I did not think Mubin a creditworthy witness. The Prosecution argued that three of Mubin\u2019s lies, in particular, were corroborative of his guilt. The conditions to be met for a lie to be corroborative of guilt were set out in R v Lucas (Ruth) [1981] 1 QB 720, which were adopted in Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh [1993] 3 SLR(R) 302 at [33] and re-stated in Public Prosecutor v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi [2015] SGCA 33 at [60] as follows: first, the lie must be deliberate; second, the lie must relate to a material issue; third, the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and fear of the truth; and fourth, the statement must be shown to be a lie by independent evidence.",
      "85": "Mubin lied in his statement of 20 October 2015 when he stated at first that he did not know Zaini and Noor.[note: 122] After he was informed that there was CCTV footage that showed that this was a lie, he then appeared to say he met them because of Lokman. In the same statement, he said that he had not seen the red car bearing registration number JQR 6136 driven by Zaini.[note: 123] At trial, when it became obvious from footage shown that he had gotten into the said car, he attempted to explain his statement away by saying he was only showed black-and-white photos of the car. This was plainly untrue as the same statement recorded that he was shown two photos \u201cof a red car\u201d. These were deliberate lies told in reaction to matters as they surfaced. These lies were material because Zaini was his supplier of heroin.",
      "86": "What was his motive? Mubin explained that he lied because he had drug transactions with Zaini, and did not want to reveal that he was buying \u201cice\u201d from him.[note: 124] This explanation was not cogent when seen in context. The denial was recorded in the statement dated 20 October 2015, after Mubin had been served the charges in respect of the two bundles of diamorphine. Further, it did not make sense that he would deny knowing Zaini and Noor because of his \u201cice\u201d transactions, when he openly admitted in the same statement that the drugs found on him, including methamphetamine, were for his own consumption.[note: 125] In my assessment, he was attempting to set up a fa\u00e7ade of being an \u201cice\u201d consumer only, and therefore it became necessary to distance himself from his diamorphine suppliers. His motive was a realisation of guilt and a fear that his knowing the supplier of the diamorphine bundles would belie his bare denial in relation to the drugs found on Lokman.",
      "87": "Mubin also lied about the regularity of his visits to the KPT Unit. In his statement of 15 October 2015, he first stated, \u201cSometimes I go back there\u201d.[note: 126] When the statement was read back to him, he added that after he moved into the Holland Close flat in mid-July, \u201c[he] never [went] back\u201d to the KPT Unit. Later in his statement dated 20 October 2015, he stated that he had only been to the KPT Unit twice, once in the week before Lokman\u2019s arrest, and one other time before that.[note: 127] This was a lie. In contrast, Tihani\u2019s evidence was that Mubin would visit her at the KPT Unit \u201conce every 3 days or a week\u201d.[note: 128] The connection with the KPT Unit was material, because the diamorphine was stored there. In my view, Mubin\u2019s lies in relation to the KPT Unit arose from a need to distance himself from the drugs stored there, and, in turn, to deny having given Lokman instructions and to declare he had no knowledge of any of the diamorphine found on Lokman.",
      "88": "L-HP1 was used by Lokman to get instructions from Mubin and arrange deliveries to parties such as Edy. It was an asset used in his work as Mubin\u2019s runner. That L-HP1 came from Mubin was material to Lokman\u2019s contention that he took instructions from Mubin as Mubin\u2019s runner and liaised with Edy in that context. In his statement dated 20 October 2015, however, Mubin stated, \u201cI have so many phones. I can\u2019t remember if I have given these phones to Lokman\u201d.[note: 129] At trial, Mubin denied that he gave L-HP1 to Lokman.[note: 130] Mubin\u2019s apparent failure to remember and subsequent denial that he gave the L-HP1 to Lokman were lies; Tihani testified that Mubin had instructed her to give Lokman L-HP1.[note: 131] Taken together with Lokman\u2019s own evidence that he was given L-HP1 by Mubin, I found that Mubin\u2019s claim was a lie. Again, Mubin knew the purpose for which L-HP1 was used, and he lied to distance himself from the delivery to Edy. His motive in lying was to shore up his defence that he knew nothing about Lokman\u2019s drug dealing.",
      "89": "I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that these lies were corroborative of Mubin\u2019s guilt.",
      "90": "The Prosecution submitted that the charge against Mubin could remain the same, despite the amendment of the charge against Lokman. In the absence of any precedent tendered, I was of the view that the more appropriate approach was to amend Mubin\u2019s charge as well. This was because the amendment of Lokman\u2019s charges meant that there was no act of trafficking that Mubin had abetted in respect of the bundle to be returned to him. In contrast, the import of Ramesh is that Mubin was the primary offender of trafficking in respect of that bundle, the act of trafficking being the act of passing the bundle to Lokman. Therefore, I amended the charge against Mubin under s 128(1) of the CPC to refer only to one of the bundles which was intended to be delivered to Edy, as follows:",
      "91": "In respect of the other bundle, Mr Goswami submitted, and I agreed, that the appropriate charge was that of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA. The Court of Appeal held in Ramesh that the act of putting the \u201cbailee\u201d in possession of the drugs would be considered trafficking as the \u201cbailor\u201d would have moved the drugs to another party, a new link in the chain of supply: Ramesh at [124]\u2013[125]. Further, while the Court of Appeal suggested that the \u201cbailor\u201d may be able to argue that he was not trafficking by showing that the movement of drugs to the \u201cbailee\u201d was not intended to facilitate onward dissemination of drugs (see Ramesh at [125]), no such defence was raised by Mubin in this case (who maintained throughout that he only consumed \u201cice\u201d, not heroin). Mubin was the one who had possession of the drugs prior to Lokman\u2019s retrieval of the drugs from the KPT Unit (see [72] above). In the present case, Mubin then put Lokman in possession of the bundles by directing him to retrieve the bundles from the KPT Unit. This act of putting Lokman in possession amounted to \u201cgiving\u201d, which is an act of trafficking under s 2 of the MDA. A fresh charge was therefore preferred as follows:",
      "92": "These charges were read and explained to Mubin at the hearing on 6 February 2020. He claimed trial to both charges and stated that he was ready to proceed on those charges: s 129(1) of the CPC. Mr Goswami confirmed on Mubin\u2019s behalf that he was not going to recall any witnesses or adduce any new evidence: s 131 of the CPC. I considered that proceeding with the trial would not prejudice the accused\u2019s defence or the Prosecution\u2019s conduct of the case, and so proceeded.",
      "93": "I found that the elements of both charges were made out beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted Mubin accordingly.",
      "94": "Regarding the first charge against Lokman, I found that he met the requirement under s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA as he acted as a courier. Although he put the bundles into their respective bags, that was merely an act that facilitated delivery: see Public Prosecutor v Abdul Haleem bin Abdul Karim [2013] 3 SLR 734 at [55]; Zainudin bin Mohamed v Public Prosecutor [2018] 1 SLR 449 at [83]. In this respect, the focus of the inquiry was \u201con the accused\u2019s acts in relation to the particular consignment of drugs which form the subject matter of the charge against him\u201d [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]: Zamri bin Mohd Tahir v Public Prosecutor [2019] 1 SLR 724 at [15]. The fact that there was a dispute as to whether Lokman or Mubin had unwrapped another unrelated bundle for distribution was not relevant to the inquiry. In addition, the Prosecution issued a CSA under s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA. As such, s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA applied and I exercised my discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment. As Lokman was above 50 years of age, caning was not imposed. In respect of the second charge, the amount of drugs involved, at not less than 19.40g of diamorphine, was significantly above the capital threshold. Further, Lokman had antecedents for drugs, specifically, drug possession. This called for the enhanced punishment with a mandatory minimum of two years\u2019 imprisonment under s 33(1) of the MDA. The Prosecution submitted that a term of eight years\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate and I so ordered. Both imprisonment terms were ordered to run concurrently from 10 September 2015, Lokman\u2019s first date of remand.",
      "95": "In respect of both charges on which Mubin was convicted, the prescribed punishment under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule to the MDA is death. The alternative sentencing regime in s 33B of the MDA did not apply to Mubin. Having ordered and given instructions for the drugs to be delivered to Edy and returned to himself for the purpose of onward trafficking, Mubin was not merely a courier. No CSA under s 33B(2)(b) was granted by the Prosecution, nor did any question that he was of unsound mind arise.",
      "96": "I therefore pronounced the mandatory sentence of death on Mubin."

Four other drug-related charges were stood down.",
      "2": "The Prosecution relied on the presumptions of possession and knowledge in ss 21 and 18(2) respectively of the MDA. The defence accepted that the presumptions applied and that the burden was on the accused to rebut the same on a balance of probabilities. The parties were in agreement that the sole issue I had to consider was whether the accused was in possession of the drugs, specifically whether he knew that the items which were later found to be drugs were in the storage compartment of the motorcycle he used when entering Singapore. Having considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties, I convicted the accused of the charge and passed the mandatory death penalty on him. I gave brief oral grounds then. The accused has appealed against my decision. I now set out the full reasons for my decision.",

He was instructed by PC Rajan to lift up the motorcycle seat for the compartment beneath to be examined. A blue plastic bag (\u201cA1\u201d), stored underneath a black jacket, raincoat and rain trousers, was found in the compartment. A power bank and a set of car keys were also found. It is undisputed that the power bank belonged to one Yeo Kim Huat Mervin (\u201cAh Huat\u201d), an acquaintance of the accused, and the car keys were that of the accused\u2019s Malaysian registered car. The accused and Ting were told to hand over their passports and to push the motorcycle to the parking space at the motorcycle checking bay. The accused complied.

      "10": "In the course of the trial, the defence objected to the Prosecution\u2019s use of certain WeChat and text messages (\u201cthe Messages\u201d) in the cross-examination of the accused. The Messages had been admitted into evidence as one part of the report containing the results of a forensic examination conducted on the accused\u2019s phone (the \u201cFORT report\u201d) and the translation thereof. The disputed messages were:\n(a)     messages sent by the accused to one Lee Wei Jye (also known as \u201cAh Fei\u201d) on 13 and 19 October 2016 (\u201cthe first category of messages\u201d);\n(b)     messages sent by the accused to an unknown person on 1 October 2016 (\u201cthe second category of messages\u201d); and\n(c)     messages on 23 October 2016 between the accused and an unknown person referred to as \u201cBoss\u201d in the messages (\u201cthe third category of messages\u201d).",
      "11": "The defence\u2019s objection was twofold: first, that the Messages were similar fact evidence used to establish propensity, and second, that relying on them would be an impermissible back-door attempt by the Prosecution to introduce \u201cwilful blindness\u201d into the equation. On the other hand, the Prosecution\u2019s position was that the Messages would assist the court in determining whether the accused had rebutted the statutory presumptions. It was clear that the defence\u2019s second objection was unmeritorious as the Prosecution had said several times that it was not relying on wilful blindness. The Prosecution\u2019s case was that the accused had actual knowledge of the items and that it was relying on the ss 21 and 18(2) presumptions to establish possession and the accused\u2019s knowledge of the nature of the drugs. This meant that the only point of substance was the defence\u2019s first objection, which I accepted in part.",
      "12": "I allowed the Prosecution to cross-examine the accused on the first category of messages \u2013 the messages between the accused and Ah Fei on 13 and 19 October 2016. I noted that there were messages exchanged between the accused and Ah Fei shortly before his arrest on 26 October 2016, which the defence rightly accepted were relevant. Specifically, the messages on 26 October 2016 were relevant in assessing the credibility of the accused\u2019s evidence that the purpose of Ah Fei\u2019s visit to Singapore on 26 October 2016 was to meet Ah Huat for a moving job on 27 October 2016 (\u201cthe upcoming job\u201d). The first category of messages suggested that the arrangement between the accused and Ah Fei on 26 October 2016 was similar to the arrangements between them on 13 and 19 October 2016. The messages therefore provided context for the court to make the assessment as regards the real nature of the arrangement on 26 October 2016.",
      "13": "In contrast, the connection between the second category of messages (the 1 October 2016 messages) and the alleged offence on 26 October 2016 was unclear. These messages, which as noted earlier were sent by the accused, read:",

I held that this could not be correct as a matter of general principle. Following s 14 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cEvidence Act\u201d), merely asserting that the Messages were potentially incriminating and therefore relevant to the accused\u2019s state of mind was insufficient. The Prosecution had to show that the evidence was probative of the relevant state of mind, ie, the state of mind related to the transaction that was the subject matter of the charge.",

Similarly, the Court of Appeal in Ng Beng Siang and others v Public Prosecutor [2003] SGCA 17 (\u201cNg Beng Siang\u201d), in finding that the previous incident of drug trafficking alluded to in a statement recorded from one of the appellants, Ng, had more probative value than prejudicial effect, observed that, inter alia, the previous incident involved \u201ca similar errand\u201d for the same person (at [41]). This showed that Ng could not have been ignorant of what he had been conveying.",
      "16": "When evaluating the admissibility and use of similar fact evidence, a balance has to be struck between its probative value and the prejudicial effect it carries. In making that assessment, the cogency, strength of inference it provides and relevance of the evidence should be considered: see Ng Beng Siang at [40]\u2013[42]; Ranjit at [17]\u2013[19]. Where there is no discernible connection between the past communication and the transaction which is the subject matter of the charge, the three touchstones cannot be said to be satisfied. Allowing the evidence to be used in such a case would primarily be to show propensity, which is impermissible.",
      "17": "The Prosecution had not led evidence to make any connection between the second category of messages (on 1 October 2016) and the events surrounding the alleged offence on 26 October 2016. Its case was not that the unknown person the messages had been sent to was any of the individuals who might have a connection to the events of 26 October 2016, such as Lew, Ah Fei or Ah Huat. While the Prosecution made vague references to the second category of messages being suggestive of the accused \u201ctransporting some kind of illegal substance ... [which] is something that the Court should consider\u201d, I did not understand the Prosecution\u2019s case to be that, on the date of his arrest, he had been transporting drugs for this unknown person or even \u201cBoss\u201d, who was referred to in these messages. In fact, the Prosecution\u2019s main argument was that the references to \u201cBoss\u201d indicated that the accused had lied when he asserted that he had no source of income other than his work in a pub in Johor Bahru. However, this was a point already addressed by the third category of messages, which the defence initially did not object to, and which were more proximate to the date of the offences for which he was charged. This meant that there was barely any probative value in the second category of messages.",
      "18": "Finally, in assessing the probative value of this category of messages, I also took into account the fact that they did not clearly speak to drug importation. For these reasons, I did not allow the Prosecution to cross-examine the accused on the second category of messages.",
      "19": "The defence initially did not raise any objections to the third category of messages (on 23 October 2016). In the course of oral submissions, and in response to a question I posed, the defence then asserted that its objection extended to this category as well. The third category of messages was relevant in addressing the accused\u2019s claim that his sole source of income in October 2016 was his salary as a waiter in a pub in Johor Bahru. It was thus relevant to his credibility. However, I did not allow the Prosecution to rely on these messages to imply an ongoing business of drug importation that included the offences for which he was charged, or to assess the state of mind of the accused in relation to the same for reasons similar to those I have stated for the second category of messages. I allowed the Prosecution to cross-examine the accused on the third category of messages only on this limited basis.",
      "20": "As noted earlier, the Prosecution relied on the presumptions under ss 21 and 18(2) of the MDA. As the accused was in charge of the motorcycle in which the controlled drugs were found, it was presumed under s 21 MDA that they were in his possession. Under s 18(2), it was further presumed that the accused knew of the nature of the drugs. The Prosecution noted that the accused led no evidence to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) on a balance of probabilities. However, the accused also contended that the Prosecution had to separately prove that he intended to import the drugs into Singapore. I address this point in [37] below.",
      "21": "The Prosecution made two main submissions: first, that it was highly improbable that Lew would have left the drugs in the motorcycle compartment without the accused\u2019s knowledge, and second, that the accused was not a credible witness.",
      "22": "On the first point, the accused did not suggest that a third party could have interfered with the motorcycle compartment after he had borrowed the motorcycle from Lew. The Prosecution appeared to accept that the drugs could have been placed in the motorcycle compartment before the motorcycle was lent to the accused. However, the Prosecution suggested that this could only have been with the accused\u2019s knowledge as none of the possible explanations for why Lew would have done so without the accused\u2019s knowledge were plausible. Three possible scenarios were outlined by the Prosecution and asserted to be implausible. First, that the accused was an unwitting courier for Lew. Second, that Lew had forgotten that the drugs were in the motorcycle compartment when he allowed the accused to use the motorcycle. Third, that Lew had deliberately placed the drugs in the motorcycle compartment to \u201cset up\u201d the accused; in other words, that it was an act of sabotage.",
      "23": "On the first scenario, it was unlikely that the accused had been used as an unwitting courier. The plastic bag containing the drugs was easily accessible: this only required a person to lift up the jacket, raincoat and trousers. The bag was also bright blue in colour, and was therefore \u201crather eye-catching\u201d. If the accused had been an unwitting courier, Lew would either have secured the plastic bag in a sealed compartment of the motorcycle, or given him instructions not to interfere with the contents of the motorcycle compartment on some pretext. There would otherwise have been a serious risk that the plastic bag would have been discovered.",
      "24": "On the second scenario, Lew could not have inadvertently left the drugs in the motorcycle compartment: the street value of the drugs was about S$89,000, and the drugs had been carefully packed into 102 packets, and then placed in four bundles. Given that Lew had been aware that the accused intended to borrow the motorcycle, it was ludicrous to suggest that Lew simply forgot that he had left the drugs in the motorcycle compartment.",
      "25": "Finally, on the third scenario, the accused testified that Lew was a good friend, and gave no reason why Lew would want to sabotage or frame him by leaving the drugs in the motorcycle compartment without his knowledge. In this regard, there had also been no tip-off to the ICA, and the check conducted on the motorcycle by PC Rajan was a routine one.",
      "26": "The Prosecution\u2019s second main submission was on credibility. It was contended that the accused was a dishonest witness. Following Harven at [2], the court was invited to consider the \u201coverall picture that emerges to [it]\u201d. The accused\u2019s explanations for his actions on the days leading up to the offence and the reasons he provided for having sent various phone messages were either plainly untrue, or inconsistent with his previous statements and the objective evidence. The falsehoods revealed the accused to be without credit. The accused was not a na\u00efve or simple person who had been duped into importing drugs, but instead a dishonest person who repeatedly lied in his testimony. His claim that he did not know about the presence of the drugs in the motorcycle compartment should therefore be disbelieved. The various inconsistencies highlighted by the Prosecution will be discussed in more detail in my analysis below.",
      "27": "Finally, while there had been some suggestion in the Prosecution\u2019s case that the accused had been in the \u201cbusiness of transporting drugs\u201d, this point was not pursued in its closing submissions.",
      "28": "The accused accepted that the presumptions in ss 21 and 18(2) applied. His primary contention was that he did not have legal possession as he did not know that the drugs were in the motorcycle compartment when he entered Singapore on 26 October 2016. According to the accused, the drugs had been stored in the motorcycle compartment by Lew without his knowledge.",
      "29": "A key aspect of the accused\u2019s defence was that he had legitimate reasons for visiting Singapore on 26 October 2016. These reasons largely concerned Ah Huat. Ah Huat and the accused had been co-workers at a moving company called \u201cKNT\u201d until July or August 2016. When Ah Huat invited the accused to join a new moving company that he was starting, the accused agreed and resigned from KNT. Ah Huat resigned later and joined a moving company named VS Movers & Logistics Private Limited (\u201cVS Movers\u201d). It transpired that this company was not in fact owned by Ah Huat, even though the accused claimed to have been under the impression that it was. They remained in regular contact, and the accused visited Singapore regularly to try to recruit other workers from KNT to join VS Movers. However, Ah Huat was not as yet able to offer permanent employment to the accused: it would seem that the accused, being a Malaysian, needed a work permit to be employed in Singapore, and VS Movers, being a new company, was not yet able to secure work permits for foreign workers. This was a source of frustration for the accused as he had left KNT in the hope of securing employment with the new company that Ah Huat was starting. On 23 October 2016, Ah Huat messaged the accused and offered him employment on a three-day job from 27 to 29 October 2016, ie, the upcoming job. Ah Huat suggested that he (the accused) could work on the upcoming job as a \u201ccasual worker\u201d using somebody else\u2019s NRIC. Ah Huat then told the accused to contact him on 26 October 2016 so that he could inform the accused of the location of the upcoming job.",
      "30": "The accused also met Ah Huat in Singapore on 24 October 2016. At this meeting, the accused borrowed Ah Huat\u2019s power bank (\u201cthe power bank\u201d) to charge his mobile phone but did not return it that day. He left for Johor Bahru with the power bank. Later that morning, Ah Huat sent the accused a WhatsApp message to ask why he had not returned the power bank as promised.",
      "31": "The accused planned to come into Singapore on 26 October 2016 for four reasons. First, he intended to meet Ah Huat to return the power bank. It was not disputed that the accused had the power bank with him when he entered Singapore (see [4] above). Second, he intended to discuss the upcoming job with Ah Huat. Third, he wanted to spend a day in Singapore with Ting. Fourth, he planned to introduce Ah Fei and a Malay gentleman to Ah Huat for the upcoming job.",
      "32": "For these reasons, the accused intended to enter Singapore on 26 October 2016. He asked Lew whether he could use the motorcycle as his own motorcycle had broken down. The request was made over the phone at around 1.00am on 26 October 2016. As it was raining when the accused left his house in Johor Bahru at around 3.40am, he decided to enter Singapore using his car instead of the motorcycle. However, as it later stopped raining, Ting suggested that they use the motorcycle instead. The accused then drove to Lew\u2019s house in his car, borrowed the motorcycle and a motorcycle helmet, and left for Singapore. He did not see the blue plastic bag containing the drugs in the motorcycle compartment and did not look under the raincoat, jacket or trousers that were placed on top of it.",
      "33": "The defence\u2019s position was therefore that the accused had legitimate reasons for entering Singapore on 26 October 2016 and had not been aware of the presence of the blue plastic bag and the drugs therein. The statements recorded from him showed that he had consistently maintained he had not known that the drugs were there. There was no objective evidence that the accused was involved in drug-related activities, or that there was an arrangement for him to import drugs into Singapore on 26 October 2016.",
      "34": "The accused asserted that he had asked the officers to contact Lew when he was arrested. It should be noted that this was not recorded in his two contemporaneous statements or the statement recorded after he was served with a notice under s 33B of the MDA (\u201cthe MDP statement\u201d).",
      "35": "Finally, the defence emphasised the fact that the Prosecution had not charged Lew for any offences despite (1) his DNA being found on the drug-related exhibits, and (2) the possibility of the presumption under s 21 being invoked against him given that the motorcycle was registered in his name. The defence submitted that if there had been evidence that the accused had imported the drugs on the instructions of Lew, as had been put to the accused in cross-examination, Lew would have been charged. The reasonable inference to draw from the failure to charge Lew was that there was no evidence of any conspiracy or common intention between Lew and the accused to import the drugs. On the totality of the evidence, it was more likely that Lew was the owner of the drugs, had intended to distribute them in Malaysia, and had simply forgotten to take the drugs out of the motorcycle compartment when the accused had borrowed it.",
      "36": "The elements of the charge of importation under s 7 MDA are (Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor [2019] 2 SLR 254 at [27]):\n(a)     the accused was in possession of the drugs;\n(b)     the accused had knowledge of the nature of the drugs; and\n(c)     the drugs were intentionally brought into Singapore without prior authorisation.",
      "37": "As I noted earlier, the Prosecution relied on the presumptions under ss 21 and 18(2) MDA to establish the elements stated above in [36(a)] and [36(b)] respectively. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was not required to separately prove that the accused intended to import the drugs into Singapore. The word \u201cimport\u201d in s 7 MDA should be accorded its ordinary meaning of bringing an object into the country (Public Prosecutor v Adnan bin Kadir [2013] 3 SLR 1052 at [6] and [67]). In the present case, there was no suggestion that the accused had not intended to enter Singapore. Instead, his defence was primarily that he had not been aware of the presence of the drugs in the motorcycle compartment. This was an effort to rebut the presumption under s 21 MDA. If the accused intentionally entered Singapore in knowing possession of the drugs, and with knowledge of their nature, it would follow that he intended to import the drugs. I was thus satisfied that the charge would be made out if the accused failed to rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge.",
      "38": "It was common ground that the primary question I had to determine was whether the accused had rebutted the s 21 MDA presumption by proving on a balance of probabilities that he did not know of the presence of the drugs. As the Prosecution noted, the accused\u2019s claim that he did not know the drugs were in the motorcycle component was a bare assertion, and there was no direct evidence either way. Therefore, in determining whether the accused had rebutted the presumption under s 21 MDA, I had to consider his credibility. It was a key plank of the accused\u2019s case that he had good reasons for visiting Singapore on the day of his arrest, ie, 26 October 2016. As such, a key question was whether the reasons provided were credible. At the same time, it was important to weigh any possible explanation as to why Lew would have placed or left the drugs in the motorcycle compartment without the accused\u2019s knowledge. This was particularly since it was the accused\u2019s position under cross-examination that that was exactly what Lew did (see [28] above). The determination of these questions fed into my assessment of his claim that he did not know of the presence of the drugs and whether he had discharged his burden of proof on a balance of probabilities.",
      "39": "As I explain below, having considered the evidence of the accused and witnesses such as Ah Huat, as well as the phone records adduced in evidence, I did not find the accused to be a credible witness. I also did not accept that there was any plausible explanation for the drugs being placed in the motorcycle compartment without the accused\u2019s knowledge. In doing so, I was conscious of the guidance provided by the Court of Appeal in Gopu Jaya Raman v Public Prosecutor [2018] 1 SLR499 (\u201cGopu\u201d) at [25], in particular, that the evidence must be evaluated neutrally in determining whether the presumption has been rebutted, with no predilection for either conclusion. I set out my reasons below.",
      "40": "I should state at the outset that I was conscious the accused consistently maintained that he did not know that the drugs were in the motorcycle compartment, and that they were not his. This was reflected in various investigative statements:\n(a)     in the MDP statement, he stated that he \u201c[did] not know anything regarding the contents [of] the [motorcycle]\u201d;\n(b)     in the first contemporaneous statement recorded at 7.34am on 26 October 2016 (\u201cthe first contemporaneous statement\u201d), he said that he did not know what the plastic bag was, who it belonged to, or that it was \u201cin the motorbike as [he] did not check it\u201d;\n(c)     in the long statement recorded on 1 November 2016 (\u201cthe 1 November statement\u201d), the accused stated that he did not see anything else inside the motorcycle compartment except for a black jacket and that he did not check what was underneath it; and\n(d)     in the long statement recorded on 2 November 2016 (\u201cthe 2 November statement\u201d), the accused stated that the drugs were not his, and that he had never seen them or known what was in the packages prior to being arrested. He asserted that he did not know who they belonged to or why they were in the motorcycle, and that he had never come into contact with them.",
      "41": "This was consistent with his oral testimony where he maintained that he did not look underneath the jacket that was placed in the motorcycle compartment, and that he did not know the blue plastic bag containing the drugs was there.",
      "42": "I turn now to explain why I did not accept his evidence.",
      "43": "As I indicated above at [38], a key question in this case was whether the reasons provided by the accused for entering Singapore at the material time were credible. The accused claimed that he entered Singapore on 26 October 2016 for four reasons (see [31] above). Besides his intention to have a meal with Ting in Singapore, the other reasons he provided involved meeting Ah Huat. These were to return the power bank, introduce Ah Fei and a Malay gentleman for the upcoming job, and to discuss the upcoming job.",
      "44": "It was pertinent that the last two reasons \u2013 introducing Ah Fei and the Malay gentleman, and discussing the upcoming job \u2013 were not mentioned by the accused in any of his investigative statements. The field diary kept by the officers recorded that they had been told that the accused borrowed the motorcycle to return the power bank to Ah Huat. In the MDP statement, the accused similarly only referred to returning the power bank to Ah Huat. This was reiterated in the first contemporaneous statement recorded from him on 26 October 2016:",
      "45": "The accused did not provide any other reasons in his 1 November statement. In the 2 November statement, the accused again stated that his \u201cintention of coming into Singapore was solely to return the [power bank] to Ah Huat\u201d [emphasis added]. This time he added that \u201c[a]fter meeting Ah Huat, [he intended] to bring [Ting] to eat some nice food before going back to Malaysia\u201d. No other reasons were provided. The accused was not able to offer an acceptable explanation for the omission of the other two reasons in the investigative statements. I do not think that these other reasons were \u201cminor details\u201d, as his counsel attempted to argue in closing submissions, particularly since the accused saw fit to specifically state in his statements that he intended to meet Ah Huat for the purpose of returning the power bank. If indeed these were minor reasons, it was surprising that they played such a significant part in the accused\u2019s testimony. It must be noted that the accused did not assert that he had informed the recorders of these other reasons and that they had failed to record them. The absence of a satisfactory explanation for these reasons not being mentioned in the investigative statements suggested to me that they were not genuine. I was therefore of the view that the accused was seeking to embellish his reasons for coming into Singapore on 26 October 2016. It would follow that the arrangement between the accused and Ah Fei on 26 October 2016 was not to meet Ah Huat to discuss the upcoming job as the accused alleged. This reason will be explored in greater detail below (see [47] below).",
      "46": "The accused asserted that he and Ah Huat had agreed to meet on 26 October 2016. It is common ground that the accused and Ah Huat met in Singapore on 24 October 2016 to discuss the upcoming job. The accused testified that they had agreed then to meet again on 26 October 2016 to discuss the upcoming job. Further, in his 2 November statement, the accused stated that he had promised Ah Huat on either 24 or 25 October that he would return the power bank on 26 October. I was not persuaded that there was in fact a prior arrangement between Ah Huat and the accused to meet on 26 October 2016 for either of these two reasons.",
      "47": "I shall first address the first reason \u2013 that they had agreed to meet again on 26 October 2016 to discuss the upcoming job. The meeting on 24 October 2016 took place after Ah Huat\u2019s messages on 23 October 2016 to the accused, notifying him that the upcoming job was on the cards. However, I note that there was no objective evidence, eg, messages exchanged with Ah Huat, corroborating the accused\u2019s claim that he and Ah Huat had agreed at that meeting to meet again on 26 October 2016. It is pertinent that when asked, Ah Huat testified that he could not remember whether he and the accused had arranged on 24 October 2016 to meet again on 26 October 2016.",
      "48": "Significantly, the intention to discuss the upcoming job with Ah Huat on 26 October 2016 at a meeting which had been pre-arranged on 24 October 2016 was not mentioned in any of the investigative statements. If the accused had indeed made arrangements on 24 October 2016 to meet Ah Huat on 26 October 2016 to discuss the upcoming job, there would have been no reason to omit this given its significance to his defence. For example, the accused clearly stated in the 2 November statement that he met Ah Huat on 24 October 2016 to speak about the upcoming job. He could very well have also said that there was an agreement to meet again on 26 October 2016 for the same reason. It was pertinent that when Ah Huat messaged the accused on 24 October 2016 to ask why the accused had not returned the power bank, the accused did not respond to assert that he would return it on 26 October as they had agreed on 24 October 2016 to meet then. It was also relevant that there were no messages from the accused to Ah Huat on either 25 or 26 October 2016 to set the time for the meeting or, at the very least, to inform Ah Huat that the accused was on his way.",
      "49": "I struggled with why the accused and Ah Huat would need or want to meet again on 26 October 2016 when they had met just two days before on 24 October 2016 and the upcoming job was to start the very next day. In this respect, the Prosecution observed that the message sent by Ah Huat to the accused on 23 October 2016 at 11.57am suggested that the plan was for the accused to call Ah Huat to obtain the address for the upcoming job: \u201c...you give me a call on Wednesday, I give you the address.\u201d Here, \u201cWednesday\u201d was 26 October 2016. It is clear from the message on 23 October 2016 that the plan was for the accused to call Ah Huat on 26 October 2016 to find out the address for the upcoming job. Thus, there was no need for the accused to meet Ah Huat on 26 October 2016 to obtain the address for the upcoming job or indeed for any other purpose related to the upcoming job. Under cross-examination, the accused testified that the plan was for them to \u201ctalk about questions relating to the job, for example, who was joining in, where we were supposed to meet, where we were going to get up the lorry et cetera\u201d on 26 October 2016. However, the 2 November statement indicated that they had already agreed at the meeting on 24 October 2016 that they would meet near Ah Huat\u2019s home on 27 October 2016:",
      "50": "I therefore could not understand why there would have been a need to meet again on 26 October 2016 to revisit the question of where they would meet to board the lorry. In any event, if there had in fact been a need for further discussion, there was no apparent reason why this could not have taken place over the phone as Ah Huat had suggested.",
      "51": "In these circumstances, it is difficult to understand what purpose would have been served by a second meeting between Ah Huat and the accused on 26 October 2016 to discuss the upcoming job. Indeed, if a day out with Ting had been planned for 26 October 2016, it is difficult to see why there was a need to meet on that day to discuss a matter which had just been discussed two days earlier.",
      "52": "I turn to the second reason, ie, that the accused had entered Singapore pursuant to an arrangement to meet Ah Huat to return his power bank. He asserted in the 2 November statement that this arrangement had been agreed to on 24 or 25 October 2017. It is unclear whether this arrangement was a reference to the pre-arrangement to meet on 26 October 2016 that was made at the meeting on 24 October 2016. While the accused consistently maintained that he entered Singapore to return the power bank to Ah Huat, his evidence on this arrangement was similarly problematic. Ah Huat testified that the accused had said, when he borrowed the power bank, that he would return it to him at around 10.00am on 24 October 2016. This was also implied in the accused\u2019s statement, where he said that he had told Ah Huat that he would return the power bank \u201clater\u201d at the latter\u2019s workplace. The accused did not keep his word, and Ah Huat messaged him at 11.21am the same day, asking if the accused had \u201crun away\u201d with the power bank. It would follow that the arrangement to return the power bank would have been made after the meeting on 24 October 2016. The evidence before me, including the phone records, did not indicate that the accused had promised Ah Huat on either 24 or 25 October 2016 that he would return the power bank on 26 October 2016. In the text messages that were sent on 24 and 25 October 2016, the power bank was not mentioned at all, let alone a meeting on 26 October 2016 to return the same. According to the accused, he called Ah Huat to \u201cgive him an answer\u201d after returning to Malaysia. However, the phone records did not indicate that such a call was made after the accused left Singapore at 9:47am on 24 October 2016. This was in line with Ah Huat\u2019s testimony that he did not think the accused had responded to his message asking whether he had \u201crun away\u201d with the power bank. Collectively, these cast doubt on whether there had in fact been an arrangement that had been made to return the power bank on 26 October 2016, as claimed by the accused in the 2 November statement.",
      "53": "In any case, if the accused was going to turn up for the upcoming job on 27 October 2016, there was really no reason why there would have been a need to meet Ah Huat on 26 October 2016 to return the power bank. There was no urgency for the power bank to be returned on 26 October 2016. This could very well have been done on 27 October 2016. In fact, Ah Huat did not press for the return of the power bank after his message at 11.21am on 24 October 2016 (see [52] above).",
      "54": "For the above reasons, I did not accept that there was a prior arrangement for the accused to meet Ah Huat on 26 October 2016 to either discuss the upcoming job or to return the power bank. In its closing submissions, the defence placed some emphasis on the fact that Ah Huat had testified that it would not have been surprising for the accused to have turned up near his house at around 5.00am on 26 October 2016. However, to my mind, this was to an extent beside the point since the accused\u2019s position was that the meeting with Ah Huat on 26 October 2016 was pre-arranged. The fact that the evidence showed his testimony on this point to be false therefore gave rise to serious questions about the accused\u2019s credibility and truthfulness. In any event, Ah Huat\u2019s testimony in this regard did not resolve the doubts I had as to why there was a need for the accused to meet Ah Huat on 26 October 2016, as I have explained above.",
      "55": "While I accept that the power bank was in motorcycle compartment at the time of the arrest, it did not necessarily follow that there was a plan to meet Ah Huat to return the power bank on 26 October 2016. I therefore did not accept that a meeting with Ah Huat on 26 October 2016 was intended for the two reasons offered by the accused.",
      "56": "More fundamentally, the accused\u2019s evidence that he had also intended to introduce Ah Fei and the Malay gentleman to Ah Huat for the upcoming job was inconsistent and problematic. The question that arose from this was why the accused had to embellish his evidence in this manner if he had genuinely come into Singapore to discuss the upcoming job and to return the power bank to Ah Huat. I now turn to consider these reasons.",
      "57": "As noted earlier, there was no mention in any of the accused\u2019s investigative statements of an intention to introduce Ah Fei or the Malay gentleman to Ah Huat. Even in the defence\u2019s opening statement, there was no mention of this Malay gentleman, and it appeared as though the only person the accused intended to introduce to Ah Huat on 26 October 2016 was Ah Fei. I address his claim in respect of the Malay gentleman and Ah Fei in turn.",
      "58": "The Malay gentleman was allegedly interviewed by the accused following the meeting with Ah Huat on 24 October 2016 for the purpose of the upcoming job. It is telling that the accused was not able to even offer the name of the alleged Malay gentleman. Under cross-examination, the accused mentioned for the first time that he intended to introduce the Malay gentleman to Ah Huat on 26 October 2016:",
      "59": "It was unclear why there was a need to introduce the Malay gentleman to Ah Huat for the upcoming job particularly when the former had not yet confirmed that he was keen on working on the job. It is also unclear why the accused would want to make the introduction without first giving Ah Huat notice of his intention to do so. Further, no evidence which corroborated the accused\u2019s account was brought to my attention, eg, phone records showing that arrangements had been made with the Malay gentleman to meet with Ah Huat on 26 October 2016 at a particular time. Despite the emphasis the defence placed on the \u201clegitimate\u201d reasons the accused had for visiting Singapore on 26 October 2016, as noted earlier the Malay gentleman was not featured in the defence\u2019s opening statement. In the accused\u2019s examination-in-chief, he similarly did not suggest that he would be bringing the Malay man to meet Ah Huat on 26 October 2016. The accused\u2019s evidence to the effect that he planned on introducing this unknown Malay person to Ah Huat was therefore suspect at best, and appeared to be something the accused conjured up on the spot in the heat of cross-examination.",
      "60": "The same might be said of the accused\u2019s intention to introduce Ah Fei to Ah Huat for the upcoming job. The messages exchanged between the accused and Ah Fei on 26 October 2016 did in fact indicate that there was a plan for them to enter Singapore at approximately the same time. The question was whether this was to introduce Ah Fei to Ah Huat for the upcoming job. In answering this question, I considered the following: (1) the accused\u2019s evidence on his previous meetings with Ah Fei, which had been arranged in a similar manner, and (2) the absence of any objective evidence to corroborate the alleged plan to introduce Ah Fei to Ah Huat for the upcoming job.",
      "61": "The phone records showed that the accused and Ah Fei had coordinated their entry into Singapore on three occasions: 13 October 2016, 19 October 2016 and 26 October 2016. Under cross-examination, the accused testified that his meeting with Ah Fei on 13 October 2016 was \u201cnormal\u201d, and that they had planned to meet the day before. According to the accused, they would stop for a cigarette after crossing the customs, and talk about where they would eat together. I found that this was not in fact a casual meeting as the accused had suggested. It appeared from the messages that this meeting was urgent or important: the accused messaged Ah Fei at 5.21am that morning asking Ah Fei to let him know when he reached the immigration or \u201cstamping\u201d area. In the messages that followed, the accused reminded Ah Fei to let him know when he was crossing the border and asked for updates as to where Ah Fei was more than once. The accused accepted that the messages showed he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about whether Ah Fei would be on time. He explained that he had sent these messages because he did not want to wait for Ah Fei for too long. Allegedly, he needed to rush over to KNT to recruit workers to join VS Movers with him and Ah Huat. I found this explanation difficult to accept.",
      "62": "Nothing about this meeting appeared to be casual. First, the number of messages that the accused sent to Ah Fei asking where he was and how long he would take to get to the immigration area suggested that there was something quite important about this meeting. Otherwise, as the Prosecution suggested, the two of them could have met at any time in Johor Bahru. If indeed the accused was in a rush to recruit workers to join Ah Huat at VS Movers, it was difficult to understand why there was a need to meet casually after Singapore immigrations had been cleared to have a cigarette and discuss where they would have lunch, particularly as, according to the accused, Ah Fei was often not punctual. Lunch was a matter that could have been coordinated over the phone, and the accused could have simply informed Ah Fei that he was in a rush and would go ahead without Ah Fei instead of waiting. Furthermore, the accused characterised Ah Fei as a mere acquaintance whom he had only regained contact with approximately two weeks before the 2 November statement was recorded. In the circumstances, it was therefore difficult to understand why the accused would have wanted to meet Ah Fei casually on 13 October 2016.",
      "63": "Second, the evidence suggested that the meeting was not one that was set up simply because they were entering Singapore at about the same time. The ICA records suggested that the accused arrived in Singapore at around 5.07am on 13 October 2016. From the messages, it appears that as at 6.25am, Ah Fei still had not crossed the border. The evidence therefore suggested that the meeting was not merely one of convenience.",
      "64": "Third, and more pertinently, the accused sent two messages to Ah Fei telling him to delete information from his phone: \u201c[p]hone number and WeChat delete first then rush\u201d and \u201c[r]emember to delete your phone first then cross the checkpoint\u201d. The accused\u2019s evidence was that he had been asking Ah Fei to delete messages relating to illegal money lending activities from his phone. He pointed specifically to a message sent by Ah Fei on 13 October 2016 at 6.15am, which he claimed was related to illegal moneylending. It was suggested to the accused that this could not have been the case as his message to Ah Fei \u2013 asking him to delete his phone records \u2013 was sent before Ah Fei\u2019s message on the alleged illegal moneylending activities was received. In response, the accused claimed that this was because Ah Fei first sent a similar message to Ting, which the accused had seen. This was all very convenient. In any event, the accused\u2019s explanation was not very logical. As the Prosecution rightly submitted, if the accused had not been involved in the alleged moneylending activities, the natural response would have been to tell Ah Fei to stop sending him those messages, rather than to tell Ah Fei to delete his phone records. Indeed, if the accused had been so concerned that the Singapore authorities would see this particular message, I would have expected that the accused himself would have deleted the message considering the frequency with which he visited Singapore.",
      "65": "I was therefore not convinced that the accused\u2019s meeting with Ah Fei on 13 October 2016 was a casual one. The phone records demonstrated that the same could be said of their meeting on 19 October 2016, where the messages sent by the accused to Ah Fei again indicated that there was some importance to their meeting, which the accused denied on the stand. These conclusions were relevant to my decision in two ways. First, it undermined the accused\u2019s credibility and demonstrated that his evidence was selective and dishonest, at least at certain points. Second, it was relevant context for assessing whether the accused\u2019s arrangement to meet Ah Fei on 26 October 2016 was truly to meet Ah Huat for the upcoming job. In the same vein as 13 October 2016 and 19 October 2016, the two of them coordinated their entry into Singapore on 26 October 2016, with the accused again asking Ah Fei whether he had reached the \u201cstamping area\u201d, and saying that he would follow Ah Fei after the latter crossed the border.",
      "66": "I turn next to the absence of objective evidence. There was no evidence of the accused\u2019s plan to introduce Ah Fei to Ah Huat other than the accused\u2019s oral testimony. As the accused himself agreed, there were no messages exchanged with Ah Huat which corroborated his claim that he had been planning to introduce potential workers to Ah Huat on 26 October 2016. In fact, there were no messages exchanged between Ah Huat and the accused about any potential worker, or between the accused and Ah Fei about the upcoming job.",
      "67": "The accused\u2019s explanation appeared to be two-fold. First, as already alluded to above at [54], it was customary for the accused to contact Ah Huat only after entering Singapore. However, as noted above, the accused\u2019s position was that there was a plan for him to meet Ah Huat on 26 October 2016 (even if the plan did not expressly include Ah Fei or the Malay gentleman). There was therefore little reason why the accused would not have communicated to Ah Huat his intention to bring potential workers to meet him. I found it difficult to believe that Ah Huat, who was in charge of a job that was due to start very shortly, would not have been kept updated on how many workers the accused would be bringing to work on it. The manpower needs for the job would surely have had to be discussed. Further, it was difficult to understand why there would have been a need for Ah Huat to interview Ah Fei for a one-off moving job the next day, particularly as the accused also testified that \u201cAh Huat said that he had no issues as long as the person was able to work well\u201d with him. No explanation was provided by the accused in this regard. In any event, I note that the accused\u2019s position was that the meeting had been arranged with Ah Fei in advance. Yet, there were no messages with Ah Fei that suggested there had been a plan to meet Ah Huat. Indeed, this begs the question of why Ah Fei was not introduced to Ah Huat at the meeting on 24 October 2016.",
      "68": "There is a further difficulty with the accused\u2019s evidence. The alleged arrangement for Ah Fei to meet Ah Huat was never mentioned in any of his investigative statements. This was despite the fact that he had been specifically shown a photograph of Ah Fei by Investigating Officer Quah Yong Sen (\u201cIO Quah\u201d) when the 2 November statement was recorded. In this statement, he told IO Quah that they were mere acquaintances. He made no mention of his plan to get Ah Fei to work on the upcoming job with him and that one of the purposes of the visit on 26 October 2016 was to introduce him to Ah Huat. The accused also did not give evidence at trial to the effect that he had in fact made mention of this plan to IO Quah during his statement recording, and that IO Quah had failed to record this in the investigative statements.",
      "69": "In the circumstances, it was more likely than not that the accused did not intend to introduce Ah Fei to Ah Huat on 26 October 2016. If he had, this would surely have been mentioned in one of his investigative statements, or at least in one of the many messages he sent to Ah Fei and Ah Huat in the preceding days. Rather, it appeared to be another instance in which Ah Fei and the accused coordinated their entry into Singapore for some other purpose that had been important to them. There was insufficient evidence for me to determine what that was, but I was persuaded that it was not to meet Ah Huat.",
      "70": "Finally, I turn to the accused\u2019s suggestion that he had come to Singapore in part to spend a day here with Ting. The defence argued that the fact that a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (\u201cDNATA\u201d) had been ordered in respect of Ting indicated that the Prosecution was satisfied that she was not involved in any drug activity. Ting had been with the accused from the time she got into his car and it was \u201cquite clear\u201d that neither of them had checked to see what was in the motorcycle compartment under the jacket or knew that the drugs were there. According to the defence, Ting would otherwise be facing criminal charges along with the accused. This line of reasoning was fundamentally misconceived. First, the DNATA ordered did not necessarily mean that Ting had not been involved in the alleged importation, or that the Prosecution took this view. Second, even if Ting was not involved, or did not know that the drugs were there, that did not necessarily mean the same could be said of the accused. The accused was the one who borrowed the motorcycle from Lew. In short, there was no basis for me to make any findings or inferences on her involvement, much less to factor that into my assessment of the accused\u2019s credibility or state of mind.",
      "71": "For completeness, I should state that the mere fact that the accused might have had an additional reason for entering Singapore did not detract from the fact that he could have, at the same time, entered Singapore with the intention of importing the drugs. In this sense, this additional reason provided by the accused was irrelevant.",
      "72": "The accused attempted to characterise his request to borrow the motorcycle from Lew on 26 October 2016 as opportunistic. He stated in cross-examination that: \u201c[Lew] called me first and asked me to top up his prepaid card, and after he called me, I took the opportunity to ask him if I could borrow [the motorcycle] from him.\u201d This was contrary to the 1 November statement, which indicated that he had called Lew and asked to borrow the motorcycle before the latter asked him to top-up his prepaid card. Faced with this difficulty, the accused asserted that the statement was inaccurate in this respect. This was put to the interpreter of the statement, Mr Wong Png Leong, who disagreed. The accused claimed he had not noticed the inaccuracy when the statement was read to him as he was not in \u201cthe mood to listen\u201d given that he was facing the death penalty. He allegedly only wanted to make a phone call after the statement was recorded, as he was afraid that he would be given the death penalty the next day. It is farcical and contrived to suggest that the accused did not pay attention as the statement was read back to him because he thought the death penalty would be given the next day. Instead, it seemed to me that he did not ask for the statement to be corrected because it was in fact accurate.",
      "73": "The accused\u2019s own motorcycle had allegedly been undergoing repair, and the ICA records clearly showed that the accused had used a motorcycle on every one of his numerous trips into and out of Singapore from 1 September 2016 to the date of his arrest. On many of these occasions, he had in fact borrowed the motorcycle from Lew. It would therefore have been natural for him to have contacted Lew to do this in the early morning of 26 October 2016.",
      "74": "Pertinently, the phone records show that the accused had in fact messaged Lew at 1.03am asking Lew to call him: \u201cXiang, call me Xiang, I cannot get through your phone leh\u201d [original emphasis in bold omitted]. It was therefore the accused who had first tried to call Lew, who returned the accused\u2019s call afterwards. Thus, in so far as the 1 November statement had stated that the accused had called Lew on his mobile phone to ask to borrow his motorcycle, this was in substance correct as it was the accused who had initiated contact with Lew in order to borrow it. In this regard, the accused later agreed that he was the one who had wanted to call Lew to borrow the motorcycle, and that Lew had called him in response to the message he sent at 1.03am. His evidence on this point was therefore inconsistent: to the extent that he had initially tried to characterise his request as opportunistic, this was, even by his own evidence, untruthful.",
      "75": "After the conversation with Lew, the accused drove to a 7-Eleven store that was 200m away from his home to top-up the phone cards as requested by Lew. According to the accused, it was raining at that time. He then went home to sleep for about two hours. Ting messaged him at 3.25am to ask whether he was awake. He replied at around 3.40am to ask her to fill in the immigration cards, giving her the registration number of the motorcycle, JRN177. In his examination-in-chief, he was asked by defence counsel why he had sent Ting the registration number JRN177:",
      "76": "His response was essentially that he did so as he had already asked to borrow the motorcycle from Lew and that he had intended to ride the motorcycle into Singapore. However, this answer posed a problem.",
      "77": "The accused confirmed that it had been raining when he drove to the 7-Eleven to top up the phone card after he had spoken to Lew. When I asked how this affected his plans to use the motorcycle, he testified that he became worried that it would continue raining the next morning, and therefore changed his mind about using the motorcycle and instead planned to drive his car to Singapore. The accused testified that he even put his \u201ccar card\u201d into the car, and made preparations to get his auto-pass. I found his evidence not credible. If indeed he had changed his mind about using the motorcycle, there would have been no reason for him to ask Ting at 3.40am to fill in JRN177 (the motorcycle\u2019s number) on the immigration card. The accused\u2019s evidence was that he had not checked to see if it was raining before sending Ting the message at 3.40am as he had just woken up. If this was the case, he would presumably have maintained his plan to drive into Singapore instead of using the motorcycle. This would explain why he had asked Ting to fill in JRN177 into the immigration card. When it was suggested to him that if he had planned on using the car, he would have given Ting his car\u2019s vehicle registration number at 3.40am, he then baldly stated that \u201cperhaps [he] had sent the wrong message\u201d. This was implausible and also at odds with his earlier evidence that he had sent the message with \u201cJRN177\u201d because he intended to use the motorcycle to enter Singapore. To my mind, this pointed to the conclusion that the accused had always intended to use the motorcycle to enter Singapore notwithstanding the rain. The rain was not a factor at all.",
      "78": "This conclusion is fortified by the fact that the accused never communicated to Lew any change of plans as regards the use of the motorcycle on account of the rain. When asked why he did not tell Lew that he had changed his mind and planned on using the car, the accused testified that:",
      "79": "The accused\u2019s description of his decision to use his car as having been made very quickly was at odds with his evidence that he had planned to use his car when he saw that it was raining on his way to the 7-Eleven (see [77] above). More fundamentally, I found it difficult to believe that the accused felt it unnecessary to call Lew to tell the latter that he would not be borrowing the motorcycle after all. This was particularly since Lew had to hand the keys to the motorcycle to the accused in the wee hours of the morning and would therefore have had to be disturbed for this purpose. As such, I found his purportedly cavalier attitude not credible.",
      "80": "For the above reasons, it was clear to me that the accused was not truthful when he characterised the request to use the motorcycle as opportunistic, or when he claimed that he had decided to use the car as a result of the rain. Instead, it seemed to me that he had planned to use the motorcycle all along regardless of the inclement weather, and that Lew had agreed to the use of the motorcycle.",
      "81": "I did not accept that the accused had expressly told the officers the drugs belonged to Lew, as he claimed to have done. This was not recorded in any of the investigative statements, in which the accused maintained that he did not know whom the drugs belonged to. For example, the first contemporaneous statement records as follows:",
      "82": "According to the accused, this was inaccurate. Instead, he claimed that his answer had been \u201cI don\u2019t know. This was left behind by the vehicle owner.\u201d He allegedly told Sgt Ong that the answer recorded was not complete or accurate, but had been told by Sgt Ong that he was not a CNB officer and did not have the authority to amend the statement. This was difficult to accept. There was no reason why Sgt Ong would not have relayed this request to SSSgt Khairul. This is consistent with the accused\u2019s understanding that Sgt Ong as the interpreter would have had to relay the request to SSSgt Khairul:",
      "83": "There was also no reasonable explanation for the accused\u2019s failure to ask SSSgt Khairul to amend the statement. The accused initially claimed that he did not do so as he did not know who the relevant person to ask was, and later that SSSgt Khairul was in a rush when recording the statement. Neither of these reasons were convincing. There was no evidence SSSgt Khairul was in a rush. Further, it would have been clear to the accused that SSSgt Khairul was the person recording down his answers. The accused could have easily spoken to SSSgt Khairul in Malay to make the request to amend the statement. It is difficult to fathom why the request to amend the statement was never made to SSSgt Khairul and why the accused would sign the statements despite this. This was particularly since the accused testified at least once that he thought that Lew\u2019s ownership of the drugs was an \u201cimportant\u201d point.",
      "84": "It is therefore unsurprising that the defence did not seek to persuade me in its closing submissions that the accused had affirmatively told the officers that the drugs belonged to Lew (in contrast with his alleged requests for them to contact Lew (see [87] below), which the defence emphasised in its submissions).",
      "85": "For completeness, I note that the accused also initially claimed that he had told IO Quah during the recording of the 2 November statement that Lew had left the drugs in the motorcycle compartment. This was an assertion he repeated more than once. On this account, the 2 November statement was wrong in so far as it recorded him as saying that he was \u201cnot sure whether the drugs in the motorcycle [had] anything to do with [Lew].\u201d His evidence on this later shifted, and he agreed that the statement had been correctly recorded.",
      "86": "The factors above to some extent put paid to a point that the accused had been quite strident in asserting in his testimony, ie, that the drugs were Lew\u2019s and had been placed by him in the motorcycle compartment. To be clear, it was not the fact that the accused did not ascribe ownership of the drugs to Lew that was significant, but rather his questionable claim to have done so, which cast doubt on his credibility.",
      "87": "One of the key planks of the accused\u2019s case was that he had informed the CNB officers, when the MDP statement and the first contemporaneous statement were recorded, that he had borrowed the motorcycle from Lew, and that he had given the officers Lew\u2019s phone number. He also claimed to have asked them to call Lew to prove that he had not been aware of the drugs and suggested that they \u201creturn to Malaysia to crack the case\u201d. The accused claimed that some of the officers responded by saying that they did not have the authority to do so, and others told him to be quiet for the moment.",
      "88": "Again, I did not accept his claim to have asked the officers to contact Lew. The accused\u2019s request that they call Lew, and Lew\u2019s phone number, were not recorded in the field diary, the MDP statement or the contemporaneous statements. The accused\u2019s version of events was put to SSSgt Khairul, SSgt Razif and Sgt Ong. None of these officers testified that the accused had provided them with Lew\u2019s number, although Sgt Ong stated that he remembered the accused telling SSSgt Khairul that the motorcycle belonged to Lew, and that he should call him. This was in contrast with SSSgt Khairul\u2019s evidence, which was that the accused had not asked him to call Lew.",
      "89": "I found the accused\u2019s evidence difficult to accept because there was no credible reason why his requests would have been left out from all of the documents above if they had in fact been made. What he purportedly told the officers clearly would have been exculpatory. Yet, it was not recorded. On the other hand, details concerning Ah Huat, such as his phone number and address, were recorded in the MDP statement, the first contemporaneous statement and the statement recorded at 10.15am the same morning (\u201cthe second contemporaneous statement\u201d). There was no plausible reason why the same officers would not record assertions by the accused that were either exculpatory or would go towards demonstrating substantive assistance. This was particularly since one of the primary purposes of the MDP statement was to inform the accused person that his substantive assistance might result in the alternative sentencing regime applying if he were to be convicted.",
      "90": "Recognising this difficulty, the defence suggested that the omission was a result of the officers being more concerned about who the drugs were to be delivered to, and the identity of the accused\u2019s Singapore contact, rather than where the drugs came from. The defence was careful not to suggest that the officers deliberately censored information provided by the accused or that they had acted irresponsibly. However, the defence argued that the officers\u2019 interest in persons in Singapore was indicated by the fact that the second contemporaneous statement required the accused to identify Ah Huat from a photo line-up. I did not accept the defence\u2019s submission.",
      "91": "Even if the focus of the officers was on persons in Singapore, this would not have precluded them from recording information on Lew provided by the accused. There was no reason to think that the officers focused solely on where the drugs were going to the exclusion of where they came from, such that the officers would not have recorded express requests to contact Lew. It was difficult to imagine why they would do that. The MDP statement indicated clearly that the Public Prosecutor might take into account assistance from the accused in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. There was no evidence that the CNB was not interested in the identity of Lew or in following up on that lead, or that this had resulted in the officers failing to record information provided by the accused. This was also not put to officers such as SSSgt Khairul by the defence. In any case, it was implausible that SSSgt Khairul, as a processing officer, would have made the decision to exclude significant information. In fact, when the phone number of Lew\u2019s pre-paid card had been provided by the accused on 1 November 2016, this was recorded by the officers.",
      "92": "It was telling that this allegation only surfaced at trial. The accused did not convey the requests concerning Lew (or the fact that they had been made and not recorded) to IO Quah when the three long statements were recorded. This was despite the detailed recounting of the events on the day of his arrest being recorded, beginning with the inspection by PC Rajan. I therefore did not accept the accused\u2019s claim that he had provided the officers with Lew\u2019s number asking them to call Lew and to undertake investigations in Malaysia. This again raised questions as to the accused\u2019s credibility.",
      "93": "The accused\u2019s evidence was also inconsistent in respect of the events on 24 October 2016. These were tangentially relevant to the events on 26 October 2016 in so far as there was a suggestion that he had agreed with Ah Huat on 24 October 2016 to meet him again two days later. More significantly, his shifting accounts of what had transpired on this day indicated that he was not a truthful witness.",
      "94": "As I indicated above at [46], it was common ground that the accused met Ah Huat on 24 October 2016 to discuss the upcoming job. In the 2 November statement, the accused claimed that the meeting with Ah Huat lasted approximately two hours, and that after Ah Huat left, he remained at the coffee shop for a while before heading back to Malaysia. The impression given in this statement was that the only thing the accused did in Singapore on 24 October 2016 was to meet Ah Huat at the coffee shop. In his oral evidence, this position shifted materially. He testified in his examination-in-chief that after meeting Ah Huat, he met a Malay gentleman at Tan Tock Seng Hospital to recruit him to work with him and Ah Huat on 27 October 2016 (see [58] above). He claimed to have returned to Malaysia thereafter.",
      "95": "It transpired in the course of cross-examination that the accused had apparently also run some form of errand for Lew on that day. This had not been raised in either his statements or in his examination-in-chief. This only came to light because of messages that were extracted from the accused\u2019s mobile phone and set out in the FORT report. Numerous messages were exchanged between Lew and the accused on that day, and the Prosecution cross-examined the accused on a number of them. I found his responses on these messages to be deliberately unhelpful and even deceptive. In particular, there was a series of messages in which the accused told Lew that he had handed an Indian person \u201cthe wrong thing\u201d. Lew responded by essentially asking the accused what had happened, and why he had handed over the \u201cwrong thing\u201d. This appeared to be a mistake that the accused took seriously, as evidenced by the messages he sent thereafter:",
      "96": "Under cross-examination, the accused was asked who this Indian person he handed the \u201cwrong thing\u201d to was. His response was that he could not remember who this person was, or what he had handed to this person. Despite this, the accused was apparently still able to testify that he did not break the law, that the incident was unrelated to the events on the day of his arrest, and later that Lew had not been unhappy when they met in Malaysia subsequently. He did not provide any explanation for his ability to recall these specific details, but nothing else. More troublingly, when pressed on how he could remember that the incident with the Indian man was not related to the events of 26 October 2016, he then said that he could remember \u201ca bit\u201d, but that \u201c[it was] not important\u201d. When asked to relate what he could recall, he immediately reverted to asserting that he could not remember. It seemed to me that the accused was intentionally being uncooperative. This was also illustrated by his evidence that he could not remember who he had referred to as \u201cBoss\u201d in his messages with Lew. This too was difficult to accept. By his own account, he had stopped working with Lew by this point, which was merely three years ago. There must have been a limited group of people that both of them would have referred to as \u201cBoss\u201d, and his alleged inability to identify this person was therefore puzzling.",
      "97": "Finally, the accused\u2019s deliberate evasiveness was also evidenced by his testimony that this errand for Lew was not one of the reasons he entered Singapore on 24 October 2016. From the messages exchanged between the accused and Lew, it was clear to me that the accused had been doing something for Lew that involved passing an item to an Indian person. This was also indicated by the updates the accused provided Lew, such as telling Lew that he would be done after waiting for \u201cone more Malay person\u201d. This unknown Malay person was clearly known to Lew, since the accused referred to him as \u201c[t]hat new person the new one [sic]\u201d. The fact that the errand for Lew had not been mentioned in the accused\u2019s statements casts further doubt on his credibility.",
      "98": "To be clear, while the Prosecution suggested to the accused that he had been passing an illegal substance to the Indian person on 24 October 2016, there was no evidence of any association between these messages and the transaction that is the subject matter of the charge. The Prosecution did not attempt to argue otherwise in its closing submissions. As such, the relevance of the accused\u2019s testimony on this was limited to the fact that it gave rise to doubts as to his credibility and truthfulness as a witness. It in fact indicated that he was a witness who was evasive and less than forthright.",
      "99": "It was clear from the foregoing that the accused was not a credible witness. The difficulties in his evidence was not merely confined to his alleged reasons for entering Singapore, but also systemically plagued his testimony in other significant areas, such as his request to borrow the motorcycle from Lew, the events upon his arrest and his responses to the messages exchanged with Lew on 24 October 2016, demonstrating that he was not in fact a truthful witness whose bare assertion that he did not know of the presence of the drugs in the motorcycle compartment could be believed.",
      "100": "As I explained above, in considering whether it was more likely than not that the accused did not know the drugs were in the motorcycle compartment, I considered the accused\u2019s credibility and the veracity of the reasons he offered for visiting Singapore on 26 October 2016. Against this, I also considered the plausibility of the various scenarios that could explain how and why the drugs came to be in the motorcycle compartment at the material time, ie, when the accused entered Singapore, without the accused\u2019s knowledge. In this connection, I agreed with the Prosecution that the various scenarios were implausible. The defence\u2019s position on this was that it was more likely than not that Lew had intended to distribute the drugs in Malaysia and simply forgot to take them out of the motorcycle compartment before lending it to the accused. In oral submissions, it described this as a \u201chypothesis\u201d and said that it was not central to, or part of, its case, which was confined to the accused\u2019s lack of knowledge that the bag containing the drugs was in the motorcycle compartment. Presumably, this was to address any argument that the accused ought to have called Lew. Indeed, it was difficult to see how this could be anything but central to the accused\u2019s case.",
      "101": "Neither party argued that the drugs had been placed in the motorcycle compartment by a person other than the accused or Lew. The accused testified that the motorcycle compartment had been locked when he took possession of it from Lew, and that the motorcycle had been parked in the compound of Lew\u2019s house, albeit with the gate closed but unlocked. Investigation Officer Yang Rongluan also testified that it was not possible to open the seat compartment without the motorcycle key. The key to the motorcycle had been with Lew who had handed it over to the accused when he picked up the motorcycle. I therefore had no reason to doubt that the drugs had been placed in the motorcycle compartment by either or both of them, even though the DNA evidence suggested that only Lew had been involved.",
      "102": "The first possibility, as identified by the Prosecution, was that Lew had intentionally planted the drugs in the motorcycle to set the accused up. The accused had been specifically asked whether he believed Lew had done so, and testified that he did not think Lew did. He was unable to suggest any reasons why Lew would leave the drugs in the motorcycle and thereafter lend it to him. Indeed, it is inconceivable that Lew would have done this intentionally as that would be a sure way of implicating himself and simultaneously losing S$89,000 worth of drugs. As to the former, the motorcycle was, after all, registered in his name, and his DNA was all over the drugs. There was absolutely no conceivable reason why Lew would want to set up the accused and in the process set himself up as well.",
      "103": "There was also no motive for Lew to frame the accused in this manner. The accused described Lew as a \u201cvery good friend\u201d and as a senior employee who provided guidance when the two of them worked at KNT movers. Lew was apparently a generous friend who would lend the accused the motorcycle when the latter asked; indeed, the ICA records suggested that Lew lent the accused the motorcycle 22 times between 1 September and 5 October 2016. Lew had in fact also agreed to lend the accused the motorcycle, allegedly on short notice, on 26 October 2016. There was no indication of any animosity, or any reason why Lew would have wanted to set the accused up. As the Prosecution pointed out, there was also no tip-off given to the Singapore authorities with respect to the motorcycle and the accused. It was therefore unlikely that Lew had intentionally left the drugs in the motorcycle compartment with the objective of getting the accused into trouble. The defence rightly accepted that this was not a possible explanation.",
      "104": "Another possibility was that Lew had intended to use the accused as an unwitting courier. This had been the case in Gopu (see [39] above), where the majority in the Court of Appeal found at [91] and [92] that while there was a plan to transport the drugs in question into Singapore, the accused person, who rode a motorcycle containing the said drugs into Singapore, was not part of this plan. The court found that the drugs in question had been placed in the said motorcycle without his knowledge, and therefore that they were not in his possession. In contrast, on the facts of the present case, this was implausible: again, there was no reason to suppose that Lew, as a good friend of the accused, would do so, particularly since this exposed the accused to the risk of being arrested on a capital charge. It also exposed Lew to criminal liability for the same reasons as stated above at [102]. One would have thought that if Lew had intended to use the accused as an unwitting courier, he would have chosen a motorcycle that had no connection with him and ensured that his DNA was not on the drugs. Moreover, Lew would have also ensured that the drugs could not be easily discovered by the accused. I therefore found it implausible that Lew intended to use the accused as an unwitting courier.",
      "105": "The defence\u2019s \u201chypothesis\u201d was instead that Lew had the drugs for purposes of distribution in Malaysia, and that he had forgotten to take the drugs out of the motorcycle compartment. I did not find this to be plausible. The drugs had a street value of approximately S$89,000. It was implausible that Lew would have simply left the drugs unattended in the motorcycle compartment or have forgotten to take them out when he lent the accused the motorcycle. Further, the accused had arranged to borrow the motorcycle at approximately 1.00am; Lew would have had ample opportunity to remove the drugs from the motorcycle compartment prior to the accused collecting it, or to alert the accused before he entered Singapore at 5.20am if he had indeed forgotten about the drugs when the accused collected the motorcycle. On the accused\u2019s testimony, he had even called Lew again to tell him to \u201cbe prepared\u201d while he made his way to Lew\u2019s house. I found it difficult to accept that Lew would have simply forgotten that the drugs were in the motorcycle compartment given their nature and the implications for the accused and himself if the drugs had been discovered by the authorities.",
      "106": "I have examined these possibilities to test the veracity of the accused\u2019s evidence that he was not aware that the drugs were in the motorcycle compartment, on a balance of probabilities. The implausibility of the permutations which could exculpate the accused was another factor that I weighed together with the conclusions I reached above on the accused\u2019s credibility in assessing whether the accused had discharged his burden of proof.",
      "107": "For completeness, I should state that I did not draw any inference from the decision of both parties not to call Lew to give evidence. Lew was the owner of the motorcycle. Lew\u2019s DNA was found on the drugs, and the Prosecution accepted this suggested that Lew was the person who had packed the drugs. In a similar vein, the accused\u2019s position was that the drugs had been left behind by Lew. Despite the central role Lew appeared to play in the alleged offence, he was not called as a witness by either the Prosecution or the defence. He had been offered by the Prosecution to the defence, who had interviewed him and issued a subpoena for his attendance. However, following the accused\u2019s testimony, the defence indicated that it would not be calling Lew.",
      "108": "On 26 August 2019, the Prosecution extended the investigative statement recorded from Lew to the defence. During the oral closings, the Prosecution confirmed that disclosure was not made on the basis of the principle in Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor [2011] 3 SLR 1205. The defence did not challenge this or make any application to re-open evidence.",
      "109": "The Prosecution argued that the defence\u2019s decision not to call Lew as a witness should give rise to an inference that Lew\u2019s evidence would not have assisted the accused in discharging his burden of proof in rebutting the presumptions under ss 21 and 18(2) MDA. It sought to distinguish this from an adverse inference. In doing so, the Prosecution relied on the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Farid bin Mohd Yusop [2015] 3 SLR 16, which considered the application of illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act (at [43] to [47]). Essentially, illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act provides that the court may, in certain circumstances, infer that the evidence which could have been adduced but was not would have been unfavourable to the defendant.",
      "110": "There was no need for me to consider whether it was appropriate to draw the inference suggested by the Prosecution in this case since I was satisfied, even without drawing this inference, that the defence had not met its burden of proof on a balance of probabilities. In any event, I do not think illustration (g) advances or assists the Prosecution\u2019s submission. I observe, however, in obiter, that Lew was clearly a material witness whose evidence could have corroborated the defence\u2019s \u201chypothesis\u201d that the drugs had been intended by Lew for distribution in Malaysia and mistakenly left in the motorcycle when it was lent to the accused. This was also a situation in which the accused bore the burden of showing that he did not have the requisite knowledge given the presumptions against him.",
      "111": "The defence described the offer of Lew as a witness as a \u201cpoisoned chalice\u201d. Given my conclusions above, there is no need for me to express a view on this. Further, as there was no need for me to consider whether this was an appropriate case to infer that Lew\u2019s evidence would not have supported the defence\u2019s case, I say no more on this point.",
      "112": "While I did not need to draw any inference with regard to the failure to call Lew, I was conscious of the fact that the burden is on the accused to offer sufficient evidence to persuade the court that he was not aware of the existence of the drugs. He did not discharge this burden. The indelible scars on his credibility as outlined above meant that his assertion that he did not know the drugs were in the motorcycle compartment could not be taken at face value. This, coupled with the implausibility of the various alternative explanations for the presence of the drugs in the motorcycle compartment without the accused\u2019s knowledge, as well as the inconsistent accounts he gave for entering Singapore at the material time, led me to convict him of the charge he faced.",
      "113": "For the reasons above, I found that the accused did not prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know of the existence of the drugs in the motorcycle compartment. Consequently, I also found that he did have possession of the drugs. Given that possession, or the absence thereof, was the central premise of the defence, I convicted the accused of the charge.",
      "114": "Turning to my decision on sentence, the punishment prescribed under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the MDA is death. Under s 33B(1)(a) read with s 33B(2) MDA, the court has discretion to sentence the offender to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane if (1) the offender proves that, on a balance of probabilities, his involvement was restricted to the acts in ss 33B(2)(a)(i)-(iv) MDA; and (2) the Public Prosecutor certifies that the person has substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore.",
      "115": "Under s 33B(2)(a), the burden of proof is on the accused to show on a balance of probabilities that he was a mere courier. In doing so, the accused may only rely on evidence that had been adduced at trial \u2013 the majority in the Court of Appeal decision of Public Prosecutor v Chum Tat Suan and another [2015] 1 SLR 834 made it clear that no further evidence may be introduced at the sentencing stage in support of the courier argument (at [77]\u2013[84]).",
      "116": "The defence submitted on sentence that the evidence adduced demonstrated that the accused\u2019s involvement was restricted to that of a mere courier, and that there was no evidence adduced suggesting that the accused\u2019s involvement went further than that. The Prosecution was in agreement with the defence on this point, and stated on record that it had no objections to the position that the accused was a mere courier.",
      "117": "I concurred with parties and found that the accused was a mere courier. His role was limited to transportation of the drugs that were the subject matter of the charge into Singapore. Based on the evidence adduced at trial, the only fact before me in relation to the accused\u2019s drug-related activities was that of transportation. There was no evidence suggesting that the accused played a greater role in the drug operation. Indeed, on this point, the Prosecution rightly conceded that no evidence had been led suggesting further involvement on the part of the accused. The accused was not found with any drug weighing or packing equipment; nor was there any evidence of phone records or email correspondence which suggested that the accused had a greater role to play such as coordinating the entire operation.",
      "118": "However, although I found that the accused was a mere courier, the Prosecution did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA. Accordingly, as the two elements under s 33B(2) MDA are cumulative, the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B(1)(a) MDA was not available to the accused.",
      "119": "I thus imposed the mandatory death penalty on the accused."

      "1": "The appellant, Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad (\u201cthe Appellant\u201d), claimed trial to two capital charges of trafficking in a controlled drug under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2), and punishable under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cMDA\u201d). The first charge was for having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking 64 packets containing 1,827.21g of granular/powdery substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 63.41g of diamorphine (\u201cthe diamorphine\u201d). The second charge was for having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking nine blocks containing not less than 2,251.90g of vegetable matter, which was analysed and found to be cannabis (\u201cthe cannabis\u201d).",
      "2": "At the trial, the Appellant disputed all the elements for both charges. The High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) convicted the Appellant of both charges. She also found that the Appellant was not a courier, and in any case, the Public Prosecutor had not issued a Certificate of Substantive Assistance. Accordingly, she imposed the mandatory death sentence on the Appellant: see Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad [2018] SGHC 268 (\u201cGD\u201d) at [2].",
      "3": "The Appellant has appealed against his conviction as well as his sentence. On appeal, the Appellant does not dispute that he had possession of the diamorphine and that he knew what it was. The sole issue in relation to the first charge is whether the Appellant possessed the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. As for the second charge, the Appellant accepts that he was in possession of the cannabis, but contends that he did not have the requisite knowledge of the nature of the drugs; nor did he possess the cannabis for the purpose of trafficking.",
      "4": "In the present case, an issue which is of central importance is the Prosecution\u2019s duty in relation to witnesses who can be expected to confirm or, conversely, contradict an accused person\u2019s defence in material respects (\u201cmaterial witnesses\u201d). Given the Prosecution\u2019s overarching duty of fairness, we were troubled that statements recorded from four such witnesses were not disclosed to the Defence in the present case; neither were these witnesses called by the Prosecution to rebut the Appellant\u2019s defence if, indeed, their accounts of the events supported the Prosecution\u2019s case. At the end of the hearing of this appeal, we therefore directed the parties to tender further submissions on what, if anything, was the Prosecution\u2019s duty in these circumstances.",
      "5": "This appeal also presents us with the opportunity to examine the issue of excessive judicial interference in the specific context of criminal proceedings, as that was a further point taken by the Appellant. We are satisfied, having reviewed the record of the proceedings and considered the entirety of the context, that the complaint of excessive judicial interference is not made out. Nonetheless, we take this opportunity to examine and reiterate the need for judges to exercise especial prudence, caution and restraint in criminal proceedings, where the consequences of excessive judicial interference on an accused person\u2019s life and liberty may be severe indeed.",
      "6": "We begin our narrative by setting out the events leading to the Appellant\u2019s arrest. In doing so, we largely use the account given by the Appellant at the trial, which was generally consistent with the contents of the last four of his ten statements to the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d). The Appellant admitted that the account reflected in his first six statements, in which he referred to the involvement of someone called \u201cDanish\u201d, was essentially untrue, a point to which we will return below (at [83]\u2013[88]).",
      "7": "At the material time, the Appellant lived with his wife, Mashitta binte Dawood (\u201cMashitta\u201d), their children and their domestic helper (\u201cthe Helper\u201d) in their flat at Fernvale Link (\u201cthe Flat\u201d). The Appellant\u2019s cousin, Sheikh Sufian bin Sheikh Zainal Abidin (\u201cSufian\u201d), also stayed with them in the Flat. The Appellant and Mashitta occupied the master bedroom, the children and the Helper occupied one bedroom, while Sufian occupied another bedroom (\u201cBedroom 1\u201d).",
      "8": "The Appellant would smoke methamphetamine in the Flat daily. Sometimes he would do so alone, and several times a week, he would do so with other individuals in Bedroom 1. These individuals included Sufian and two of the Appellant\u2019s friends, Muhammad Faizal bin Mohd Shariff (\u201cFaizal\u201d) and Mohammad Khairul bin Jabar (\u201cKhairul\u201d). Faizal, in particular, provided the Appellant with his supply of methamphetamine.",
      "9": "On 26 January 2016, at around 8.20pm, Faizal brought a trolley bag (\u201cthe trolley bag\u201d) to the Flat, and the Helper let him into the Flat. The Appellant claimed that unknown to him at the time, the trolley bag was placed in the storeroom of the Flat by the Helper.",
      "10": "A key issue that was raised in this case was whether the Appellant knew that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016, and that the trolley bag contained drugs. The Prosecution\u2019s case is that the Appellant knowingly received the trolley bag, which contained both the diamorphine and the cannabis, from Faizal. The diamorphine was found in Bedroom 1 after the Appellant\u2019s arrest, while the cannabis was found in the trolley bag (see [16]\u2013[17] below).",
      "11": "The Appellant, however, testified that he did not know that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016. He claimed that he had been asleep from about 7.00pm until about 10.00pm on the night of 26 January 2016, and after he woke up, he left the Flat with Faizal at about 10.20pm. It was only on the next day, 27 January 2016, that he discovered the diamorphine and the trolley bag in the Flat. According to the Appellant, on 27 January 2016, at about 2.00pm, he noticed several packets of diamorphine laid out on the bed in Bedroom 1. He got into a quarrel with his wife, Mashitta, who was angry that the Appellant allowed people to come to the Flat to \u201cdo \u2018drugs\u2019\u201d and \u201cmake use of [him]\u201d. The Appellant then placed the packets of diamorphine into an \u201cAkira\u201d fan box (\u201cthe Akira box\u201d) which was in Bedroom 1. He suspected that it was Sufian, the occupier of Bedroom 1, who had laid out the diamorphine on the bed.",
      "12": "Shortly thereafter, at about 4.00pm, the Appellant discovered the trolley bag in the storeroom. He was informed by Mashitta, who in turn had been told by the Helper, that Faizal had brought the trolley bag to the Flat. According to the Appellant, the diamorphine must have been taken out of the trolley bag as there had been no drugs in the Flat on the previous day, apart from some drugs in the master bedroom which were for his own consumption.",
      "13": "On the same afternoon, the Appellant called Sufian and Faizal and asked them to return to the Flat to \u201cclear the stuff\u201d. They both agreed to do so. The Appellant testified that he called Faizal \u201cstraightaway\u201d upon discovering the trolley bag. While the Appellant initially suspected that the trolley bag might contain drugs, Faizal apparently informed him that it contained cigarettes instead, and the Appellant did not check whether this was true. He evidently trusted Faizal. He claimed that Faizal had previously left drugs of various types and in various quantities, as well as cigarettes, in the Flat. On those occasions, the Appellant would call Faizal to ask him to retrieve the relevant items and he would do so.",
      "14": "The Appellant\u2019s iPhone call records were not referred to at the trial to identify the phone calls that he claimed he had made to Sufian and Faizal on the afternoon of 27 January 2016 after discovering the trolley bag and the diamorphine in the Flat. On appeal, we were referred to these call records, which corroborated the Appellant\u2019s claim. These call records showed that on 27 January 2016, the Appellant called Sufian at 4.38pm (for 53 seconds), 5.10pm (for 34 seconds) and 5.20pm (for 61 seconds). The Appellant also called Faizal at 5.47pm (for 47 seconds). While the Appellant testified that he called Faizal \u201cstraightaway\u201d after discovering the trolley bag at around 4.00pm, nothing turns on this slight discrepancy in timing, especially given that the Appellant was never referred to his call records either in the course of the investigations or at the trial.",
      "15": "On the night of 27 January 2016, at around 7.00pm, CNB officers began observing the Flat because of the Appellant\u2019s suspected involvement in drug activities. At that time, the Appellant, Mashitta, their children, the Helper and Khairul were in the Flat. The Appellant was arrested at about 8.00pm as he was leaving the Flat.",
      "16": "The CNB officers proceeded to search the Flat in the Appellant\u2019s presence, beginning with Bedroom 1. From Bedroom 1, Staff Sergeant Richard Chua Yong Choon (\u201cSSgt Chua\u201d), assisted by Sergeant Muhammad Farhan bin Sanusi (\u201cSgt Farhan\u201d), seized the 64 packets of diamorphine that formed the subject matter of the first charge. Sixty-three packets were found in the Akira box, and the last packet was found in a \u201cMintek\u201d bag (\u201cthe Mintek bag\u201d) on the bed. The search of Bedroom 1 concluded at around 8.40pm.",
      "17": "Later, at around 9.45pm, Senior Staff Sergeant Ika Zahary bin Kasmari (\u201cSenior SSgt Ika\u201d) asked the Appellant a question. The precise terms of the question were disputed and will be discussed later. In response to the question, the Appellant answered \u201cstoreroom\u201d. Senior SSgt Ika then escorted the Appellant to the storeroom, and SSgt Chua seized the trolley bag, which contained all the nine blocks of vegetable matter constituting the cannabis that was the subject matter of the second charge. He also seized a black plastic bag containing 40 cartons of contraband cigarettes which, according to the Appellant, had been placed in the storeroom a few days earlier. There were other drugs and drug paraphernalia seized from the Flat which, unless referred to below, are not material to the present appeal.",
      "18": "At the trial, the Prosecution only called the relevant CNB officers and those involved in the CNB\u2019s investigations as its witnesses. The Appellant gave evidence in his own defence but did not call any other witnesses. This meant that no evidence was led from Sufian, Faizal, Mashitta and the Helper. Plainly, they were material witnesses as they could have confirmed or, conversely, contradicted material aspects of the specific account of events given by the Appellant which we have set out above.",
      "19": "Significantly, statements were recorded from each of these four individuals. The defence counsel who represented the Appellant at the trial had requested the Prosecution to make available the statements taken from Sufian, Faizal and the Helper. However, this request was not acceded to. The learned deputy public prosecutor (\u201cDPP\u201d), Mr Lau Wing Yum, told us that the Prosecution took this position because it was of the view that these statements neither undermined its case nor strengthened the Defence\u2019s case, and therefore did not fall within its disclosure obligations as set out in Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (\u201cKadar\u201d).",
      "20": "At the trial, the Prosecution\u2019s case was, first, that in respect of both charges, it had proved that the Appellant had both possession and knowledge of the nature of the drugs. The Prosecution then relied on the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA.",
      "21": "The Prosecution\u2019s alternative case was that in respect of both charges, it would rely on the presumption of possession under s 18(1) and the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, and in all the circumstances, it could safely be inferred that the Appellant had possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.",
      "22": "For both charges, the Appellant generally disputed that he had possession of the drugs, and in particular, physical control of the drugs. He also disputed that he knew the nature of the drugs. The Appellant contended that the drugs were not his but Sufian\u2019s and/or Faizal\u2019s. In relation to the second charge of trafficking in the cannabis, the Appellant submitted that he thought that the trolley bag contained cigarettes. For both charges, the Appellant also disputed that he had possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, on the basis that he had not brought the drugs to the Flat, and on discovering them there, had told Sufian and Faizal to remove them.",
      "23": "The Judge found the Appellant guilty of both charges. In relation to the first charge, the Judge made the following findings. First, the Appellant had possession of the diamorphine since he had physical control of the Akira box and the Mintek bag, which together contained the 64 packets of diamorphine. Second, the Appellant, by his own evidence, knew at the material time that those 64 packets contained diamorphine. Third, the Appellant had not rebutted the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA. The Judge rejected the Appellant\u2019s evidence that he had merely been holding the diamorphine pending its retrieval by Sufian and/or Faizal. The Judge reasoned that the Appellant\u2019s evidence as to the intended purpose of the diamorphine was \u201cinextricably linked to his wider story\u201d about how the drugs came to be present in the Flat without his knowledge. Rejecting his assertions, the Judge found that the Appellant knew that Faizal would be delivering the drugs to the Flat on 26 January 2016. The Judge also noted the large quantity of diamorphine in the Appellant\u2019s possession, more than four times the amount which mandated the imposition of capital punishment (see GD at [89]\u2013[91]). Having rejected the Appellant\u2019s primary case as to how he came to be in possession of the diamorphine, the Judge had no difficulty finding that the Appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking.",
      "24": "On the Prosecution\u2019s alternative case, the Judge was satisfied that the Appellant had failed to rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge under ss 18(1) and 18(2) respectively of the MDA. The Judge was also satisfied that the Prosecution had proved that the Appellant had possession of the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. The sheer quantity of the diamorphine, the Appellant\u2019s possession of four weighing scales seized from Bedroom 1 and the presence of the Appellant\u2019s DNA on the exterior surface of a group of ten mini packets of diamorphine (F1D3A) showed that he was involved in packing the diamorphine. Further, his attempts to distance himself from the drugs through the fabrication of elaborate accounts about Danish showed that he was determined to conceal his involvement (see GD at [92]\u2013[94]).",
      "25": "Turning to the second charge, the Judge made the following findings. First, the Appellant had possession of the cannabis since he had physical control of the trolley bag in which the cannabis was contained. Second, the Appellant knew at the material time that the trolley bag contained cannabis, and not cigarettes. Third, the Appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA, for similar reasons as those in relation to the first charge. In this regard, the Judge noted that the trolley bag contained more than twice the amount of cannabis which mandated the imposition of capital punishment (see GD at [89]\u2013[91]). The Prosecution\u2019s alternative case was also accepted, for essentially the same reasons as those given for the first charge.",
      "26": "In coming to her decision, the Judge rejected the Appellant\u2019s submission that the Prosecution should have disclosed the statements recorded from Sufian, Faizal and Mashitta. She noted that under s 259(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d), statements made by any person (other than an accused person) in the course of any investigations into an offence were generally inadmissible, and pointed out that the Appellant had not attempted to show how the statements of Sufian, Faizal and Mashitta could be admitted pursuant to one of the exceptions set out in ss 259(1)(a) to 259(1)(e) of the CPC. Neither had the Appellant shown how these statements could be said to come within the ambit of the Prosecution\u2019s disclosure obligations as set out in Kadar ([19] supra) (the \u201cKadar obligations\u201d). The Judge also held that it was immaterial that the Prosecution had refused to produce the Helper\u2019s statement as the Helper\u2019s evidence would not have impacted her reasons for finding that the Appellant knew that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016 (see GD at [85]\u2013[86]).",
      "27": "As we mentioned at [3] above, the Appellant is appealing against his conviction and his sentence on both charges. We briefly set out his position on appeal.",
      "28": "In relation to the first charge, the Appellant no longer disputes that he had possession and also knowledge of the diamorphine (see [3] above). He contends, however, that he did not have the diamorphine, which did not belong to him, in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, but only for the purpose of returning it to Sufian and/or Faizal, who had left it at the Flat. This would not constitute trafficking, as we held recently in Ramesh a/l Perumal v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2019] 1 SLR 1003 (\u201cRamesh\u201d) at [110].",
      "29": "In relation to the second charge, the Appellant does not dispute that he had possession of the cannabis (see [3] above). However, he contends that he did not know that the trolley bag contained the cannabis. The Appellant claims that he was informed by Faizal that the trolley bag contained cigarettes, and he genuinely believed Faizal. The Appellant further submits that, in any event, he did not have the cannabis in his possession for the purpose of trafficking because the trolley bag was to be retrieved by Faizal, who had left it at the Flat.",
      "30": "In addition, the Appellant argues, in relation to both charges, that the Judge failed to appreciate in particular the significance of the non-availability of the statements of Sufian, Faizal and the Helper. Finally, while there is no allegation of bias, the Appellant contends that the Judge\u2019s conduct and her questioning of the witnesses at the trial amounted to excessive judicial interference and gave rise to the impression that her judgment had been clouded.",
      "31": "In contrast, the Prosecution\u2019s position on appeal is that none of the Judge\u2019s findings were plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence, and therefore, they should not be disturbed.",
      "32": "The issues that arise in this appeal are as follows.",
      "33": "First, we consider what, if anything, is the Prosecution\u2019s duty in relation to a material witness in the sense defined at [4] above.",
      "34": "Second, we analyse the charges before us. This requires us to consider:\n(a)     for the first charge concerning the diamorphine, whether the Appellant has rebutted the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA; and\n(b)     for the second charge concerning the cannabis, whether the Appellant has rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, and if not, whether the Prosecution has proved that the Appellant possessed the cannabis for the purpose of trafficking.",
      "35": "Third, and finally, we consider whether the Appellant\u2019s complaint of excessive judicial interference is made out, and if so, what consequences ought to follow.",
      "36": "We begin with our decision on the question in respect of which we had directed the parties to tender further submissions at the end of the hearing of this appeal (see [4] above). We framed this question (\u201cthe Question\u201d) as follows:",
      "37": "In our judgment, this raises a broader question as to the proper ambit of the Prosecution\u2019s role. It is helpful to begin with first principles. The Prosecution acts at all times in the public interest. In that light, it is generally unnecessary for the Prosecution to adopt a strictly adversarial position in criminal proceedings. As we stated in Kadar ([19] supra), \u201cthe Prosecution owes a duty to the court and to the wider public to ensure that only the guilty are convicted, and that all relevant material is placed before the court to assist it in its determination of the truth\u201d [emphasis in original omitted] (at [200]). Pursuant to this duty, under the Kadar obligations (at [113]):",
      "38": "In the subsequent analysis, we propose to address the Question in the following manner:\n(a)     first, we consider whether the Prosecution has a duty to disclose a material witness\u2019s statement to the Defence; and\n(b)     second, we consider whether the Prosecution has a duty to call a material witness. The Prosecution\u2019s evidential burden to rebut an accused person\u2019s claim and the role of adverse inferences will also be discussed.",
      "39": "Where the first of the two aforesaid sub-issues is concerned, both parties accept that the Prosecution ought to be under a duty to disclose a material witness\u2019s statement to the Defence. We agree. For convenience, we will refer to this duty as the \u201cadditional disclosure obligations\u201d.",
      "40": "We state at the outset that, as with the Kadar obligations, the additional disclosure obligations are laid down pursuant to s 6 of the CPC, which provides as follows:",
      "41": "As we stated in Kadar, the reference to what \u201cthe justice of the case may require\u201d includes \u201cprocedures that uphold established notions of a fair trial in an adversarial setting where not already part of the written law\u201d (at [105]).",
      "42": "We should point out two key differences between the Kadar obligations and the additional disclosure obligations:\n(a)     The first difference is that where the additional disclosure obligations are concerned, it does not matter whether the statement in question is: (a) favourable (and so triggers the Kadar obligations); (b) neutral; or (c) adverse to the accused person. If appropriate, and if there are valid reasons, the Prosecution can apply to the court for the redaction of those portions of the statement that have nothing to do with the accused person\u2019s defence, relevance to the defence being the factor that renders the statement a material statement in the first place.\n(b)     The second difference is that the additional disclosure obligations do not require the Prosecution to carry out a prior assessment of whether a material witness\u2019s statement is prima facie credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused person. Such an assessment is required for material that is disclosed pursuant to the Prosecution\u2019s Kadar obligations because we were concerned in Kadar to reasonably limit the amount of unused material that the Prosecution would have to disclose. This concern does not arise in relation to the statements of material witnesses because the number of such statements will in most cases be limited. The burden to disclose such statements would not be onerous on the Prosecution in most cases, and hence, there would be no need for the Prosecution to undertake any wide-ranging review or assessment of prima facie credibility and relevance before disclosing such statements.",
      "43": "For the avoidance of doubt, we should add that neither the Kadar obligations nor the additional disclosure obligations affect the operation of any ground for non-disclosure recognised by law.",
      "44": "We turn to the basis for finding a duty on the part of the Prosecution to disclose a material witness\u2019s statement to the Defence.",
      "45": "First, the Prosecution candidly acknowledged that there might be instances where \u201c[t]he Prosecution may not, despite acting in good faith, fully appreciate the defence the accused is running or intends to run\u201d. In such circumstances, the Prosecution contemplated that it might \u201cinadvertently\u201d fail to disclose statements which might tend to support the defence. In our judgment, it would be an intolerable outcome if the court were deprived of relevant evidence that might potentially exculpate the accused person simply because the Prosecution made an error in its assessment of the significance of certain evidence. The fact that such an error is made in good faith does not change the analysis.",
      "46": "Second, as also accepted by the Prosecution, an accused person ought to have access to all relevant information in order to make an informed choice in deciding whether or not to call a material witness. Both parties in fact agree that while the Defence always has the right to call a material witness, it is at a distinct disadvantage in deciding whether or not to do so when it is not aware of what the witness has previously said in the course of the investigations into the offence alleged against the accused person (see Harven a/l Segar v Public Prosecutor [2017] 1 SLR 771 at [70]). Further, as the Appellant submitted, the practical difficulties of eliciting self-incriminating evidence from a material witness might be insurmountable. For instance, in the present case, if the Appellant had called Faizal as a witness, the Appellant would have had to elicit from Faizal an admission that Faizal was involved in drug trafficking activities and intended to return to the Flat to retrieve the drugs, at a time when Faizal might have been involved in discussions with or making representations to the Prosecution in connection with his potentially being charged in relation to the drugs. In such circumstances, if the Appellant had been unsuccessful in eliciting an admission to this effect from Faizal, he might well have ended up having to apply to impeach Faizal, and yet, he would have had to do so without having Faizal\u2019s statements if those statements had not been disclosed by the Prosecution pursuant to its Kadar obligations. Any such attempt by the Appellant would likely have been doomed from the outset.",
      "47": "There is a further dimension to the disadvantage faced by the Defence in such circumstances. Suppose, in this case, the Defence had interviewed Faizal, and Faizal had confirmed the Appellant\u2019s defence that he had called Faizal on the afternoon of 27 January 2016 to ask Faizal to retrieve the drugs from the Flat, and Faizal had agreed to do so. It would ordinarily seem sensible and logical for the Appellant to then call Faizal as a defence witness to corroborate his defence. The Appellant might, however, have yet been faced with a real dilemma as to whether or not to do so. The Appellant would be aware that the Prosecution had access to whatever statements Faizal had previously made, and that those statements were thought by the Prosecution not to be subject to disclosure pursuant to its Kadar obligations. In considering the possible reasons why the Prosecution considered that Faizal\u2019s statements did not fall within the ambit of its Kadar obligations, the Appellant would have had to contemplate at least the following scenarios: (a) Faizal\u2019s statements were in fact adverse to him, contrary to what Faizal might have told him; (b) Faizal\u2019s statements were neutral to both parties; or (c) possibly, as the Prosecution recognised in its submissions, the Prosecution had wrongly assessed that Faizal\u2019s statements did not undermine its case or strengthen the Defence\u2019s case. Thus, in deciding whether or not to call Faizal as a defence witness, the Appellant would have had to consider the risk that Faizal\u2019s statements might contradict his defence and likely end up being used to undermine his credibility as a witness, all of which might ultimately harm his case at the trial.",
      "48": "In our judgment, leaving an accused person in a situation where he chooses not to call a material witness because of the dangers arising from his not being aware of what that witness has previously said in his statements to the investigating authorities does not reflect a satisfactory balance between ensuring fairness to the accused person on the one hand, and preserving the adversarial nature of the trial process on the other. As we have noted, the duty on the Prosecution to disclose a limited amount of unused material to the Defence (of which the Kadar obligations are a part) is premised on the Prosecution\u2019s duty to the court and to the public to ensure that only the guilty are convicted, and that all relevant material is placed before the court to assist it in its determination of the truth (see [37] above). The court\u2019s fundamental objective in criminal trials is to arrive at a just outcome through a fair process. This is what our decision in this case seeks to advance.",
      "49": "Further, it bears emphasis that where there is any doubt over whether a particular statement is subject to disclosure, whether under the Kadar or the additional disclosure obligations, the Prosecution ought to err on the side of disclosure. This is because the consequences of non-disclosure could be severe. As we stated in Kadar ([19] supra) at [120]:",
      "50": "We turn to the remaining points where there was some disagreement between the parties. These relate to:\n(a)     when the Prosecution should be required to disclose to the Defence the statement of a material witness; and\n(b)     whether that statement would be subject to disclosure if the material witness is called as a prosecution witness.",
      "51": "In our judgment, the Prosecution ought to satisfy its additional disclosure obligations when it files and serves the Case for the Prosecution on the accused person (if the statutory disclosure procedure applies), or at the latest, before the trial begins (if the statutory disclosure procedure does not apply). These are the same timelines as those that apply in respect of the Prosecution\u2019s Kadar obligations (see Kadar at [113]). Like the Kadar obligations, the Prosecution\u2019s additional disclosure obligations constitute a continuing obligation which only ends when the proceedings against the accused person (including any appeal) have been completely disposed of. Thus, if the relevance of a particular material witness\u2019s evidence only becomes apparent after the accused person has testified at the trial, then that witness\u2019s statement should be disclosed to the Defence at that juncture. As for whether the Prosecution is required to disclose the statement of a material witness who is a prosecution witness, we leave this issue open for determination on a future occasion. The issue does not arise here as none of the material witnesses in the present case was a prosecution witness. We elaborate on each of these points in turn below.",
      "52": "While the Appellant contended that a material witness\u2019s statement should be disclosed to the Defence before the trial, the Prosecution submitted that the statement ought to be disclosed only after the accused person has testified for two principal reasons. First, the Prosecution suggested that if a material witness\u2019s statement were disclosed to the Defence at an earlier stage, the accused person might tailor his defence to bring it in line with that witness\u2019s account. Second, the Prosecution suggested that the accused person might seek to influence that witness into giving evidence favourable to the Defence\u2019s case, or otherwise retracting or neutralising his evidence.",
      "53": "With respect, we think that these concerns are overstated. This is because the triggering of the additional disclosure obligations is itself a response to a defence which the accused person has already alluded to in his statements to the investigating authorities. If the concern is that the accused person might further \u201ctailor\u201d his defence at the trial after having had sight of the relevant material witnesses\u2019 statements, it is open to the Prosecution to challenge that defence by, for instance, taking further statements from the relevant material witnesses and calling them as rebuttal witnesses to contradict any new contentions that the accused person might put forth. If the Prosecution fails to do so, it may well be that the accused person is simply speaking the truth, rather than tailoring his defence. It should be emphasised that there is no principle of law that the evidence of an accused person must be treated as inherently incredible or being of suspect value merely because it advances his defence and is, in that sense, self-serving. If the presumption of innocence means anything at all, it must mean that an accused person who testifies to exonerate himself may be telling the truth. The assessment of whether or not he is doing so must, in the final analysis, depend on the totality of the evidence. And it should not be overlooked that courts are entirely capable of assessing the credibility of the claims made by witnesses, that being among the most basic aspects of fact-finding, which is a core judicial task.",
      "54": "In our judgment, requiring the Prosecution to disclose a material witness\u2019s statement to the Defence before the trial is also consistent with the twin rationales underlying the additional disclosure obligations which we have identified above and which the Prosecution accepts (see [44]\u2013[45] above). Since one of the reasons for imposing the additional disclosure obligations is to address the Prosecution\u2019s difficulties in assessing whether a material witness\u2019s statement falls within its Kadar obligations, it follows that the respective timelines for disclosure should be aligned. Moreover, as we have stated above (at [45]\u2013[47]), the disclosure of a material witness\u2019s statement is also meant to enable the Defence to make an informed choice in deciding whether or not to call the witness concerned in the specific circumstance where the Prosecution has chosen not to call that witness. We reiterate that an accused person should not be left in a position where he chooses not to call a material witness because of the possibility that that witness\u2019s statement may be adverse to him, when that may not in fact be the case. If a potential defence witness has provided a statement to the Prosecution that is inconsistent with what he has told the Defence, it is only fair for the Defence to have prior notice of this statement when deciding on the witnesses that it intends to call. In this connection, the Defence ought to be able to decide on the witnesses that it wishes to call before the trial and before the accused person has given evidence. This is contemplated by the statutory scheme for disclosure, which requires the Defence to list the names of its witnesses in the Case for the Defence (see ss 165 and 217 of the CPC). It is obvious that the decision on which witnesses to call is a crucial part of the Defence\u2019s preparation for trial and its assessment of the strength of its case. The latter may be a relevant consideration in deciding whether the accused person himself should testify, or, even more fundamentally, whether he should contest the charge against him. For these reasons, we are satisfied that the risks and concerns identified by the Prosecution, even assuming their validity, would in any event be outweighed by the need to ensure that the Defence is able fairly to prepare for trial and assess the strength of its case.",
      "55": "We next address the Prosecution\u2019s submission that it should not be obliged to disclose a prosecution witness\u2019s statement to the Defence, even if that witness is a material witness. As we mentioned at [50] above, this issue falls outside the scope of the Question because we are concerned here with a situation where none of the material witnesses in question was called by the Prosecution. We therefore leave open for another time, when the issue is squarely raised, the question whether the statement of a material witness who is a prosecution witness is subject to the additional disclosure obligations set out here. That said, if a prosecution witness has provided a statement that is inconsistent with his testimony at the trial, we see no reason why that statement ought not to be disclosed to the Defence as part of the Prosecution\u2019s Kadar obligations. The Defence ought to have that statement for the purposes of cross-examination and impeachment of the witness\u2019s credit if appropriate.",
      "56": "We also observe that the \u201cCode of Practice for the Conduct of Criminal Proceedings by the Prosecution and Defence\u201d, jointly issued by the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers and the Law Society of Singapore, states as follows at para 41:",
      "57": "With these observations, we leave this issue for detailed consideration on a future occasion.",
      "58": "We turn to the second part of the Question, which is whether the Prosecution has a duty to call a material witness (who, as we stated at [4] above, can be expected to confirm or, conversely, contradict an accused person\u2019s defence in material respects). Here, both parties agreed that the Prosecution has no duty (in the sense of a legal duty) to call any witness, including a material witness. The Appellant, however, suggested that the Prosecution does not have an unfettered discretion, and that it should call witnesses who are \u201cnecessary to the unfolding of the narrative\u201d.",
      "59": "We agree with the broad proposition that the Prosecution has no duty to call particular individuals as witnesses. We have previously stated that \u201cthe Prosecution has a discretion whether or not to call a particular witness, provided that there is no ulterior motive and the witness, who is available to, but not called by, the Prosecution, is offered to the Defence\u201d (see Lim Young Sien v Public Prosecutor [1994] 1 SLR(R) 920 (\u201cLim Young Sien\u201d) at [35]). In this connection, we have also previously noted that \u201c[t]here may be many legitimate reasons why the Prosecution may not wish to call a particular person as a witness, examples of which would be the lack of credibility of his evidence and/or the immateriality of his evidence (despite its apparent credibility)\u201d (see Yong Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor [2012] 2 SLR 872 at [30]).",
      "60": "In this regard, it is helpful to briefly refer to the position in other common law jurisdictions.",
      "61": "The position in Malaysia is set out in the decision of the Federal Court of Malaysia in Siew Yoke Keong v Public Prosecutor [2013] 3 MLJ 630 (see also Ghasem Hozouri Hassan v Public Prosecutor [2019] 6 MLJ 231 at [28]). There, the Federal Court stated as follows at [42]:",
      "62": "As for the English position, both parties referred us to the decision of the Privy Council in Adel Muhammed El Dabbah v Attorney-General for Palestine [1944] AC 156, where it was said at 168:",
      "63": "We note further that in England and Wales, the Prosecution\u2019s discretion is guided by the principles set out in the decision of the English Court of Appeal in R v Russell-Jones [1995] 3 All ER 239 (\u201cRussell-Jones\u201d) (see also R v Dania (Jordan) [2019] EWCA Crim 796 at [37]). We set out some of these principles below (see Russell-Jones at 244\u2013245):",
      "64": "Finally, we turn to the Australian position, which requires the Prosecution to call both witnesses who are favourable and witnesses who are unfavourable to its case. The High Court of Australia summed up the position as follows in Diehm and another v Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) (2013) 303 ALR 42 at [63]:",
      "65": "We pause to note that the Australian position is to some extent shaped by s 38 of the Australian Evidence Act 1995 (Act No 2 of 1995) (Cth), which permits the Prosecution to cross-examine its own witness if the evidence given by the witness is \u201cunfavourable\u201d to it. In other words, it is not necessary to show that the witness has turned \u201chostile\u201d, for example, by departing from an earlier statement given to the Prosecution (see Bianca Shandell Santo v R [2009] NSWCCA 269 at [26]\u2013[27]).",
      "66": "In this regard, s 156 of our Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cEA\u201d) states that \u201c[t]he court may, in its discretion, permit the person who calls a witness to put any questions to him which might be put in cross-examination by the adverse party\u201d. The Prosecution contended that leave may only be granted if the witness has been shown to be hostile. As against this, we note that in Public Prosecutor v BAU [2016] 5 SLR 146, Woo Bih Li J observed at [24] that:",
      "67": "It is not necessary for the purposes of this appeal to arrive at a concluded view on the proper interpretation of s 156 of the EA. Nevertheless, given the general rule that a party may not cross-examine its own witness, in our judgment, the Australian position ought not to apply in our context. Nor do we think it necessary to set out detailed principles to guide the Prosecution in the exercise of its discretion in calling witnesses, as is the English position. It is also unhelpful to state, as the Appellant suggested, that the Prosecution is required to call witnesses who are \u201cnecessary to the unfolding of the narrative\u201d as this expression is vague and bears no legal meaning.",
      "68": "In our judgment, it suffices to highlight that the Prosecution has no duty to call a material witness. However, in appropriate circumstances, the failure to call a material witness might mean that the Prosecution has failed to discharge its evidential burden to rebut the defence advanced by an accused person. In addition, the court may in certain circumstances be entitled to draw an adverse inference pursuant to s 116, Illustration (g) of the EA that the evidence of a material witness who could have been but was not called by the Prosecution would have been unfavourable to the Prosecution. Our reasons are as follows.",
      "69": "The principles relating to the Prosecution\u2019s burden of proof were the subject of our recent decision in Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter [2020] SGCA 2 (\u201cGCK\u201d). There, we explained that embedded within the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the Prosecution\u2019s legal burden to prove the charge against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt and its evidential burden to adduce sufficient evidence to address facts that have been put in issue (see GCK at [130] and [132]). The latter burden might also rest on the Defence, depending on the nature of the defence and the fact in issue that is being raised (see GCK at [133]).",
      "70": "As regards the evidential burden, it is well established that this is a burden which can shift between the parties. This burden was explained in Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith & Associates Far East, Ltd [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 at [58] as follows:",
      "71": "In our judgment, the Question in the present case squarely engages the Prosecution\u2019s evidential burden to adduce sufficient evidence to rebut a defence raised by the accused person that has properly come into issue. We are concerned here with the narrow situation where an accused person has advanced a specific defence which identifies specific material witnesses and the Prosecution, despite having had access to these witnesses, has chosen not to call them.",
      "72": "In this specific situation, it seems obvious to us that the Prosecution ought to call the material witnesses in question if it is necessary to do so in order to discharge its evidential burden. To be clear, the Prosecution would not need to call these witnesses if it is satisfied that it can rely on other evidence to discharge its evidential burden, such as, for example, close-circuit television (\u201cCCTV\u201d) records which directly contradict the accused person\u2019s defence. Neither would there be any question of the Prosecution having to discharge its evidential burden by calling these witnesses if the accused person\u2019s defence is patently and inherently incredible to begin with. Subject to these obvious limitations, the Prosecution runs a real risk that it will be found to have failed to discharge its evidential burden on material facts in issue if the Defence has adduced evidence that is not inherently incredible and the Prosecution fails to call the relevant material witnesses to rebut that evidence.",
      "73": "In addition, it is well established that the Prosecution\u2019s failure to a call a material witness may justify the court drawing an adverse inference against it. In Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Farid bin Mohd Yusop [2015] 3 SLR 16 (\u201cMuhammad Farid\u201d) at [45], we endorsed the following observations of the High Court in Mohamed Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak v Public Prosecutor [2000] 1 SLR(R) 922 (\u201cMohamed Abdullah\u201d) at [41]:",
      "74": "In the present context, where the Prosecution has had access to a material witness whose evidence would be directly relevant to discharging its evidential burden and is in possession of a statement from that witness, the failure to call that witness to refute the evidence led by the Defence on a fact in issue may more readily justify an inference being drawn against the Prosecution that that witness\u2019s evidence, if led, would have been adverse to it on that fact in issue. However, at the risk of stating the obvious, we stress that the drawing of an adverse inference must, in the final analysis, depend on the circumstances of each case. That is to say, while the Prosecution is always required to discharge its evidential burden whenever a defence raised by the accused person has properly come into issue, it does not inevitably follow that an adverse inference will be drawn against the Prosecution for its failure to call a material witness to testify on that defence. Nonetheless, in the context of absent witnesses, we note that it may be useful to refer to the following principles which were set out in Sudha Natrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd [2017] 1 SLR 141 (\u201cSudha Natrajan\u201d) at [20]:",
      "75": "We should also mention the following principles which are applicable to the drawing of adverse inferences generally (see Sudha Natrajan at [21], [23] and [26]):\n(a)     first, an adverse inference ought not to be drawn where the failure to produce evidence is reasonably attributable to reasons other than the merits of the case;\n(b)     second, in drawing the relevant inference, the court must put its mind to the manner in which the evidence that is not produced is said to be unfavourable to the party who might reasonably have been expected to produce it; and\n(c)     third, applying the best evidence rule, an adverse inference should not be drawn unless it can be said that the evidence that is withheld is superior to the evidence already adduced.",
      "76": "Returning to the Question in the present case, we are satisfied that the Prosecution\u2019s failure to call a material witness may result in the court finding that it has thereby failed to discharge its evidential burden in respect of a material fact in issue and/or may justify the court drawing an adverse inference if the Prosecution is unable to satisfy the court that it had good reason not to call that witness.",
      "77": "In this regard, it may not suffice for the Prosecution to justify its failure to call a material witness on the basis that that witness\u2019s prospective evidence seemed to be \u201cneutral\u201d if, clearly, that witness would have been in a position to either confirm or, conversely, contradict the accused person\u2019s defence in material respects. In the present case, given that the statements of the material witnesses concerned \u2013 namely, Sufian, Faizal, Mashitta and the Helper \u2013were not disclosed to the Defence pursuant to the Prosecution\u2019s Kadar obligations, and these witnesses were also not called by the Prosecution to discharge its evidential burden, the logical conclusion is that their statements must have been neutral in the sense that they did not speak on the matters put in issue by the Appellant.",
      "78": "This suggests, and indeed, leads to the inference that questions on material aspects of the Appellant\u2019s defence were not posed to these material witnesses when their statements were being recorded. In this regard, two important aspects of the Appellant\u2019s defence which emerged from his last four statements to the CNB (the account given by the Appellant in his first six statements being, as we noted at [6] above, essentially untrue) were that: (a) he did not know that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016 and had been asleep when Faizal arrived at the Flat with the trolley bag; and (b) he only discovered the trolley bag and the diamorphine in the Flat the following afternoon. It would appear that Faizal might not have been asked questions relating to his purpose of bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016 and whether he had handed the trolley bag to the Appellant or to the Helper. It would also appear that the Helper might not have been asked whether she was the one who had placed the trolley bag in the storeroom and what the Appellant had been doing when Faizal arrived at the Flat with the trolley bag. If that was indeed the case, then, with respect, regardless of whether Faizal\u2019s and the Helper\u2019s statements were recorded before or after the Appellant\u2019s last four statements to the CNB, we cannot see any justification for the Prosecution not having asked Faizal and the Helper these questions, which would have confirmed or, conversely, contradicted the two aforesaid aspects of the Appellant\u2019s defence in material ways. If the statements of Faizal and the Helper had been recorded before the Appellant\u2019s last four statements to the CNB, further statements could have been taken from them in relation to the questions outlined above had their initial statements been neutral to the Appellant. This would likewise be the position if the two aforesaid aspects of the Appellant\u2019s defence had only emerged at the trial, even though this might conceivably have necessitated an adjournment of the trial. After all, returning to first principles, the Prosecution is duty-bound to place before the court all relevant material to assist it in its determination of the truth. In our judgment, it would be quite unfair to expect the Defence, in place of the Prosecution, to pose to material witnesses questions which may confirm or, conversely, contradict the accused person\u2019s defence in material ways. The accused person might not have the ability or resources to mount a reasonably robust investigation to find out what evidence a material witness might give. Further, as a practical matter, it might be difficult for the Defence to elicit evidence from a material witness if such evidence would necessarily incriminate the witness.",
      "79": "We turn to address some other submissions made by the Prosecution.",
      "80": "The Prosecution submitted that the court should not draw an adverse inference against it for failing to call a material witness where the witness has been offered to the Defence or where the Defence is able on its own to trace the witness to testify (citing Lim Young Sien ([58] supra) at [35] and Yoganathan R v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [1999] 3 SLR(R) 346 at [37] respectively). However, we are presently concerned with a situation where the accused person has made a specific claim and the evidential burden falls on the Prosecution to rebut that claim. That being the case, it is for the Prosecution to call a material witness whose evidence may rebut that claim; the mere fact that the witness has been offered to the Defence or that the Defence can on its own trace the witness to testify does not change the analysis in any way. In such circumstances, if the Prosecution fails to call the witness, it may simply be found to have failed to discharge its evidential burden. There may be no need for the court to go further and draw an adverse inference as to what the missing evidence might have revealed.",
      "81": "Finally, the Prosecution submitted that if we were to hold that it has a duty to disclose a material witness\u2019s statement to the Defence in circumstances where it has chosen not to call that witness, then the court should \u201cimpose a stricter duty on the Defence to call that witness\u201d [emphasis in original]. This would mean that the court would more readily draw an adverse inference against the Defence if the Defence, having seen that witness\u2019s statement, fails to call that witness without providing a satisfactory explanation.",
      "82": "We do not accept this submission. We reiterate that the additional disclosure obligations seek (among other things) to assist the Defence in assessing whether or not to call a material witness by requiring the Prosecution to disclose that witness\u2019s statement, and not thereby to compel the Defence to call that witness as a defence witness. It is apposite to refer to the following observations of the High Court in Mohamed Abdullah ([72] supra), which we endorsed in Muhammad Farid ([72] supra) at [45], in relation to the drawing of adverse inferences against the Defence for failing to call a material witness:",
      "83": "Aside from this, there is simply no basis at all for the submission that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Defence for failing to call a material witness when it is the Prosecution\u2019s evidential burden that is in issue. The Prosecution cannot seek to discharge that burden by relying on the Defence not calling particular evidence from a material witness to advance its case, regardless of whether or not the Defence has access to statements previously given by that witness to the investigating authorities.",
      "84": "Before turning to the charges before us, we make a preliminary point concerning the inconsistencies in the Appellant\u2019s ten statements to the CNB, which we alluded to earlier (see [6] above). The contents of these statements were set out by the Judge at [25]\u2013[34] of the GD. In brief terms, the Appellant\u2019s initial account in his first six statements was that it was Danish who had left \u201cthings\u201d in the Flat in the early morning of 27 January 2016. The Appellant claimed that Danish then sent him a text message informing him that someone would come to collect the \u201cthings\u201d, but that did not happen despite the Appellant repeatedly calling Danish later that day. The Appellant claimed that he knew the \u201cthings\u201d were drugs only after he was arrested. The Appellant\u2019s account of Danish was elaborate and included details as to how he had first met Danish as well as how Danish would stay over at the Flat regularly almost every weekday since October 2015.",
      "85": "It is not disputed that the Appellant fabricated or at least embellished his account of Danish in the original version of the events that he gave in his first six statements. In his ninth statement, the Appellant admitted that Danish had never been to the Flat before, and that he had in fact never seen Danish before. At the trial, the Appellant testified that he had given this fictitious account of Danish in his defence to the two capital trafficking charges for a few reasons, including the following: he felt that he had to provide an answer to the charges; he was suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms; he was confused, in fear, in shock and not in the right state of mind; he knew that Danish was the ultimate supplier of the drugs; and he deliberately made up the story concerning Danish. Evidently, some of these reasons were conflicting.",
      "86": "The Judge found the Appellant to be \u201can untruthful and unreliable witness, who kept changing his story along the way\u201d. She also concluded that he had made up stories about Danish in his first six statements \u201cto hide the fact that he knew that Faizal had come to the Flat on 26 January 2016 with [the trolley bag]\u201d and \u201cto disassociate himself from the drugs\u201d in the Flat (see GD at [82]). This seems to us to be a significant part of the Judge\u2019s reasoning that led her to conclude that the Appellant was guilty of both trafficking charges.",
      "87": "It is useful to set out the basic principles concerning the corroborative effect of lies told by an accused person. In this regard, an accused person\u2019s lies can only amount to corroboration of guilt under carefully prescribed conditions. One such condition is that the lies must relate to a material issue (see Public Prosecutor v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi [2015] SGCA 33 at [60]). Further, even where lies which can amount to corroboration of guilt are established, they can only be employed to support other evidence adduced by the Prosecution and cannot by themselves make out the Prosecution\u2019s case (see GCK ([68] supra) at [141], citing Public Prosecutor v Chee Cheong Hin Constance [2006] 2 SLR(R) 24 at [92]).",
      "88": "In this regard, the Appellant submitted that his lie about the involvement of Danish in the events of 26 and 27 January 2016, when it was in fact Faizal who had been involved, was a lie as to the identity of the person who had brought the diamorphine and the cannabis to the Flat. The Appellant contended that this was not a material issue; rather, it was a non-issue because, first, the identity of that person was in no way relevant to the criminality that was inherent in the situation, and, second, there was, in any case, independent evidence, in particular, CCTV records, establishing that Faizal was the one who had brought the trolley bag (which contained the diamorphine and the cannabis) to the Flat. We agree. The fact of the matter is that the trolley bag was not already in the Flat prior to the events of 26 and 27 January 2016, and it was brought to the Flat by a third party on the night of 26 January 2016. This much cannot seriously be disputed. The substance of the Appellant\u2019s defence in all his ten statements to the CNB remained that when he discovered the trolley bag and the diamorphine in the Flat on the afternoon of 27 January 2016, he sought to return them to whoever had left them at the Flat, which, by the original account in his first six statements, was Danish (or someone acting on Danish\u2019s instructions and behalf). We are unable to see how, in lying that Danish, rather than Faizal, had been involved, the Appellant could be said to have disassociated himself from the drugs, as the Judge thought. In particular, we do not see how this lie could be said to be a lie that somehow corroborated his guilt in respect of the charges that he faced, even if it damaged his trustworthiness.",
      "89": "At the same time, it should be emphasised that this lie does not necessarily mean that the Appellant lied about other matters as well. This too would have to be considered in the round in the light of all the evidence.",
      "90": "In that light, we turn to the two charges before us.",
      "91": "In relation to the first charge, the sole issue, as we mentioned at [3] above, is whether the Appellant possessed the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. There is no dispute that the Appellant had possession and knowledge of the diamorphine. The Prosecution is entitled to rely on the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA, and we thus consider whether the Appellant has rebutted that presumption.",
      "92": "As for the second charge, there are two issues, it being common ground that the Appellant had possession of the cannabis (see [3] and [29] above). The first issue is whether the Appellant knew that the trolley bag contained the cannabis. In this regard, since the Prosecution has relied on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, we will have to consider whether the Appellant has rebutted that presumption. If the presumption of knowledge is not rebutted, it will then become necessary to consider the second issue, which is whether the Appellant possessed the cannabis for the purpose of trafficking.",
      "93": "In considering whether the Appellant has rebutted the relevant presumptions, we bear in mind the inherent difficulties of proving a negative, and therefore, that the burden on an accused person to rebut a presumption which operates against him should not be so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible to discharge (see Gopu Jaya Raman v Public Prosecutor [2018] 1 SLR 499 (\u201cGopu Jaya Raman\u201d) at [2] and [24]).",
      "94": "In concluding that the Appellant possessed the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, the Judge made the following findings (see GD at [94]):\n(a)     First, the Judge rejected the Appellant\u2019s evidence \u201cthat he had nothing to do with how the drugs came to be found in the Flat\u201d and \u201cthat he intended to return the drugs to Faizal or Sufian\u201d.\n(b)     Second, the Appellant\u2019s DNA was found on the exterior surface of F1D3A, a group of ten mini packets of diamorphine (see [24] above), which showed that he was involved in packing the diamorphine.\n(c)     Third, the sheer quantity of the diamorphine made an inference of trafficking \u201cirresistible\u201d.\n(d)     Fourth, it was not the Appellant\u2019s case that the diamorphine was intended for his personal consumption.\n(e)     Fifth, the Appellant did not deny that the four weighing scales seized from Bedroom 1 were in his possession and were used by him (although he claimed that he used them only to ascertain the weight of the methamphetamine that he obtained for his own consumption).\n(f)     Sixth, the Appellant\u2019s fabrication of elaborate accounts to distance himself from the drugs showed that he was concerned to conceal his involvement.",
      "95": "We develop our subsequent analysis in the following sequence:\n(a)     We begin by considering whether the Appellant\u2019s account of the events was inherently incredible. If it was not, it was incumbent on the Prosecution to adduce sufficient evidence to discharge its evidential burden to rebut the Appellant\u2019s defence (see [68]\u2013[71] above).\n(b)     In that regard, we then consider whether the Judge erred in: (i) rejecting the Appellant\u2019s evidence that he did not know about the trolley bag and the diamorphine until 27 January 2016, the day after Faizal brought these items to the Flat; and (ii) rejecting the Appellant\u2019s evidence that after discovering these items on the afternoon of 27 January 2016, he called Faizal and Sufian that same afternoon to ask them to return to the Flat to \u201cclear the stuff\u201d, and they agreed to do so.\n(c)     Thereafter, we consider whether the presence of the Appellant\u2019s DNA on the exterior surface of F1D3A showed that he was involved in packing the diamorphine.",
      "96": "In our judgment, in the context of the particular facts that are before us, if we find that the Judge erred in these material respects, the Appellant would have rebutted the presumption of trafficking. The fact that there was a large quantity of diamorphine in the Appellant\u2019s possession would be beside the point, as would be the fact that he did not possess the diamorphine for his personal consumption. This is because the Appellant\u2019s case is that he never wanted to come into possession of the drugs, and once he found the drugs, he tried to return them to those whom he thought owned them. Further, although the Appellant admitted that he possessed the four weighing scales seized from Bedroom 1, he explained, in respect of the two weighing scales that he was questioned on, that he had only used them to measure the weight of the methamphetamine that he obtained for his own consumption. We note too that in the Appellant\u2019s first statement to the CNB, he had explained that the weighing scales were used by Sufian or Danish for packing drugs and that he was not involved in packing drugs. So far as Sufian is concerned, this would not be an incredible assertion, given that he was the occupier of Bedroom 1. The Prosecution could have led evidence from Sufian to confirm or, conversely, contradict the Appellant\u2019s claim as to the use of the weighing scales, but it did not do so. Accordingly, if we accept the Appellant\u2019s account of the events, the fact that he possessed the four weighing scales seized from Bedroom 1 would not in itself be sufficient to displace the conclusion that he had rebutted the presumption of trafficking.",
      "97": "We turn to consider whether the Appellant\u2019s account of the events was inherently incredible, and if not, whether it shifted the evidential burden to the Prosecution.",
      "98": "We first set out the key assertions made by the Appellant in claiming that he did not possess the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. In so doing, we also identify in parentheses the statements in which these assertions were first made.\n(a)     The trolley bag was brought to the Flat by Faizal on the night of 26 January 2016 (seventh statement). This fact is no longer disputed and is confirmed by the CCTV records. The Appellant explained that it was \u201c[n]ot possible\u201d that the diamorphine could have been from somewhere other than the trolley bag as there were \u201cno drugs\u201d in the Flat the day before (tenth statement). It is similarly not disputed that the diamorphine was indeed initially contained in the trolley bag, although it was found in Bedroom 1 during the search of the Flat after the Appellant\u2019s arrest.\n(b)     The Appellant was asleep when Faizal brought the trolley bag to the Flat. The trolley bag was placed in the storeroom by the Helper while the Appellant was asleep (eighth statement).\n(c)     The Appellant did not know about the diamorphine until he saw it laid out on the bed in Bedroom 1 at around 2.00pm on 27 January 2016 (tenth statement). Similarly, the Appellant did not know about the trolley bag until he saw it in the storeroom on the afternoon of 27 January 2016. He did not open the trolley bag (tenth statement). While the Appellant initially said that he saw the trolley bag at around 2.00pm, he later clarified at the trial that he saw it at around 4.00pm. We do not think that anything turns on this slight discrepancy in timing given that the Appellant\u2019s statements were recorded months after the relevant events.",
      "99": "One material aspect of the Appellant\u2019s account of the events which did not emerge from his statements were the phone calls that he made to Faizal and Sufian upon discovering the trolley bag and the diamorphine in the Flat on the afternoon of 27 January 2016 and the contents of those phone calls. Nonetheless, it is not disputed that the Appellant did indeed call Faizal and Sufian that afternoon as this is evident from the call records (see [14] above). Given that Faizal and Sufian were not called by the Prosecution as witnesses, the only account of these phone calls came from the Appellant himself. In this regard, his evidence at the trial was as follows:",
      "100": "In our judgment, this aspect of the Appellant\u2019s evidence at the trial could not be described as an afterthought. It should be emphasised that throughout all of his statements, the Appellant was consistent in maintaining that he did not possess either the trolley bag or the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. Based on the original account in the Appellant\u2019s first six statements, the person to whom these items were supposed to be returned was Danish; and based on the account in his last four statements, those persons were Sufian and/or Faizal. Seen in this light, the Appellant was therefore consistent in his defence that after he discovered the trolley bag and the diamorphine in the Flat, he sought to return these items to their actual owners rather than to distribute the drugs in the trolley bag onwards to third parties.",
      "101": "Significantly, the Appellant\u2019s claim that he was seeking to return the trolley bag and the diamorphine to their actual owners was also not inconsistent with his past interactions with Faizal in particular. The Appellant elaborated as follows in his ninth statement:",
      "102": "Given this account of the Appellant\u2019s previous interactions with Faizal and the fact that the Appellant had informed the CNB that Faizal was the individual who had brought the trolley bag to the Flat, it is unclear why the Appellant was never asked, when his statements were being recorded, whether he had called Faizal to ask him to remove the trolley bag and the diamorphine from the Flat on this particular occasion. Had the Appellant been asked that question, it is possible that his claim that he had called Faizal and Sufian to ask them to remove the trolley bag and the diamorphine from the Flat and they had agreed would not have been made for the first time only at the trial.",
      "103": "In addition, had the records of the Appellant\u2019s phone calls to Faizal and Sufian on the afternoon of 27 January 2016 been referred to the Appellant in the course of the investigations, he might then have been able to provide his account as to the contents of these phone calls at an earlier stage.",
      "104": "In these circumstances, we are satisfied that the Appellant\u2019s defence had been properly put in issue. There was nothing inherently incredible about the Appellant\u2019s account of the events, and the evidential burden therefore shifted to the Prosecution to rebut the Appellant\u2019s defence (see [68]\u2013[71] above). We proceed to consider whether, in the light of the Prosecution\u2019s failure to call any evidence from the relevant material witnesses, this conclusion is affected either by the Judge\u2019s analysis or by the Prosecution\u2019s submissions.",
      "105": "The Appellant made two key assertions in his defence, both of which the Judge rejected. The first was that he did not know that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag (which contained both the diamorphine and the cannabis) to the Flat on 26 January 2016, and only discovered the trolley bag and the diamorphine in the Flat the following day. If, contrary to this assertion, the Appellant had in fact known that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016, that would destroy his claim that he did not even know of the presence of the trolley bag and the diamorphine in the Flat until the following day, as well as his second key assertion, which was that on discovering these items, he tried to have them returned to their actual owners. Further, if these two key assertions by the Appellant were properly rejected, it would point to the conclusion that, contrary to the Appellant\u2019s defence, there was a pre-existing arrangement for the drugs to be handed to him, and since it was not his case that the drugs were for his personal consumption, he must have possessed them for the purpose of trafficking. We consider below the evidence relating to the first of these key assertions.",
      "106": "We begin with the Prosecution\u2019s failure to call the relevant material witnesses \u2013 namely, Faizal, Sufian and the Helper \u2013 to challenge the Appellant\u2019s first key assertion. The relevance of their evidence was as follows:\n(a)     Faizal could have explained why he had brought the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016, whether he had handed the trolley bag to the Appellant or to the Helper, and whether the Appellant had known that he would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on that day.\n(b)     Sufian could have confirmed whether he had used the Appellant\u2019s iPhone on the night of 26 January 2016. This was significant because while the Prosecution adduced records of the phone calls made from and received on the Appellant\u2019s iPhone to refute the Appellant\u2019s claim that he had been asleep when Faizal brought the trolley bag to the Flat that night, the Appellant provided the explanation that his iPhone had been in Bedroom 1 at the time and Sufian could have been using his iPhone.\n(c)     The Helper could have confirmed whether she had received the trolley bag from Faizal and placed it in the storeroom, and what the Appellant and Sufian had been doing when Faizal arrived at the Flat with the trolley bag.",
      "107": "The Judge was unmoved by the Prosecution\u2019s failure to adduce any of this evidence because she rejected the Appellant\u2019s evidence that he did not know that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016 and only discovered the trolley bag and the diamorphine in the Flat on 27 January 2016. In this regard, the Judge relied on: (a) what she thought was an admission by the Appellant in his ninth statement, read in the light of his explanation during cross-examination of what he had said in that statement, that he knew that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016; and (b) the phone calls made from and received on the Appellant\u2019s iPhone while he was supposedly asleep on the night of 26 January 2016 when Faizal arrived at the Flat with the trolley bag. For reasons which we will shortly develop, we do not regard the Appellant\u2019s ninth statement as an admission. We are also satisfied that there was a reasonable explanation for the phone calls made from and received on the Appellant\u2019s iPhone while he was supposedly asleep.",
      "108": "It follows that, in our judgment, the Appellant\u2019s account of the events should not have been rejected without more, and it was therefore incumbent on the Prosecution to have called Faizal, Sufian and/or the Helper to discharge its evidential burden. The Prosecution could have relied on these witnesses\u2019 evidence to directly challenge the Appellant\u2019s account of the events. The Prosecution\u2019s failure to call any evidence from these witnesses left its evidential burden undischarged. Significantly, the Prosecution had access to and did record statements from these witnesses which were not disclosed to the Defence. In the circumstances, and absent any other explanation, it seems reasonable to infer that these witnesses\u2019 evidence, if adduced, would have been unfavourable to the Prosecution (see [72]\u2013[77] above). We now elaborate on our analysis and reasons.",
      "109": "Where the Appellant\u2019s ninth statement is concerned, if this statement did indeed amount to an admission by the Appellant that he knew that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016, we would have been prepared to accept that the Prosecution was entitled not to call any witnesses to rebut the first key assertion that the Appellant made in his defence. However, for the reasons that follow, we do not accept that the Appellant\u2019s ninth statement amounted to an admission.",
      "110": "We begin by setting out the relevant extracts from the Appellant\u2019s ninth statement:",
      "111": "The Appellant\u2019s ninth statement must be read in context. In his seventh statement, the Appellant had told the CNB officers that Faizal had brought the trolley bag to the Flat and that they could check the CCTV records to verify this. At the trial, the Appellant clarified that it was in fact his wife who had told him this piece of information, based on what the Helper had told her. It was this information that then prompted the Appellant to call Faizal on the afternoon of 27 January 2016 to ask him to remove the trolley bag from the Flat. Consistent with this, the Appellant said as follows in his eighth and tenth statements:",
      "112": "In his evidence-in-chief, the Appellant explained his answers in his ninth statement as follows:",
      "113": "Later, during the Appellant\u2019s cross-examination, the learned DPP read to the Appellant the extract of his ninth statement which we reproduced at [109] above. The learned DPP then cross-examined the Appellant as follows:",
      "114": "The Judge relied on the Appellant\u2019s ninth statement, read in the light of his explanation during cross-examination of what he had said in that statement, to find that he had admitted that he was \u201caware in advance\u201d on 26 January 2016 that \u201cFaizal was going to the Flat with the trolley bag and to deliver drugs\u201d (see GD at [53]).",
      "115": "We are unable to agree with this and have two principal difficulties with this portion of the cross-examination. First, contrary to what the learned DPP suggested in the questions which we emphasised in bold italics at [112] above, the Appellant had not earlier told the court that what he meant in his ninth statement was that he was \u201caware in advance\u201d that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016. In fact, this had been clarified in the extract from the Appellant\u2019s evidence-in-chief reproduced at [111] above. The learned DPP was mistaken in suggesting otherwise. This undermined any reliance being placed on the Appellant\u2019s ninth statement, read with the extract from his cross-examination set out at [112] above, as a supposed admission by the Appellant that he knew that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016. Second, the learned DPP, in his line of questioning directed at the Appellant\u2019s supposed knowledge of this, did not clearly frame his questions by reference to any specific time when the Appellant had such knowledge. This was a point of critical importance given what the Appellant had said in his seventh, eighth and tenth statements, as well as in his evidence-in-chief. In the circumstances, we are unable to accept that the Appellant\u2019s ninth statement, read in the light of his explanation during cross-examination of what he had said in that statement, amounted to an admission that he knew that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016, given that he had consistently maintained in his eighth and tenth statements and in his evidence-in-chief that he had no such knowledge and only learnt the next day (that is, on 27 January 2016) that Faizal had brought the trolley bag to the Flat.",
      "116": "We next address the phone calls made from and received on the Appellant\u2019s iPhone while he was supposedly asleep on the night of 26 January 2016 when Faizal arrived at the Flat with the trolley bag at about 8.20pm. To challenge the Appellant\u2019s account that he was asleep at that time, the Prosecution led evidence that calls were made from and received on the Appellant\u2019s iPhone between 7.51pm and 10.05pm on 26 January 2016. The Appellant\u2019s response was that he did not answer or make those calls, and that his iPhone had been in Bedroom 1 then, so Sufian could have been the one who answered or made those calls.",
      "117": "The Appellant\u2019s specific identification of Sufian as the person who most likely used his iPhone at the material time on the night of 26 January 2016 could not be dismissed as mere speculation. The Appellant was not asked by the CNB, when his statements were being recorded, to explain the phone calls made to and from his iPhone that night, even though he had said in his eighth, ninth and tenth statements that he had been asleep at the material time on that night (see [109]\u2013[110] above). It was only at the trial, more than two and a half years later, that the Prosecution first questioned him on this issue. In these circumstances, as the Appellant\u2019s counsel, Mr Andre Darius Jumabhoy, submitted, it was not surprising that the Appellant would have speculated as to who else could have used his iPhone at the material time since he was in no position to investigate the point himself.",
      "118": "It is obvious that the fact that phone calls were made from and received on the Appellant\u2019s iPhone on the night of 26 January 2016 does not actually show who made or received those calls. The Prosecution could easily have called Sufian to rebut this aspect of the Appellant\u2019s defence, but it chose not to do so. It could also have called Faizal and/or the Helper to give their respective accounts to refute the Appellant\u2019s claim that he had been asleep when Faizal arrived at the Flat with the trolley bag, the materiality of which it would have been aware of, but it likewise chose not to do so. In these circumstances, we have no basis for rejecting the Appellant\u2019s explanation as to the use of his iPhone at the material time on the night of 26 January 2016, nor for rejecting, on this basis, his claim that he had been asleep at the time and was therefore unaware that Faizal had brought the trolley bag to the Flat until he learnt of this the next day at around 4.00pm.",
      "119": "It follows that, in our judgment, the Judge was wrong to reject the Appellant\u2019s account of how the trolley bag and its contents came to be in the Flat without his knowledge, and the failure of the Prosecution to address this left an evidential gap in its case against the Appellant.",
      "120": "We turn to the second key aspect of the Appellant\u2019s defence, namely, that when he discovered the trolley bag and the diamorphine in the Flat on the afternoon of 27 January 2016, he called Sufian and Faizal asking them to return to the Flat to remove these items, and they agreed. Again, the Prosecution failed to call any evidence to refute this claim. The Judge was unmoved by this, essentially because she thought that the \u201cobjective evidence\u201d, namely, the DNA evidence, rendered the Appellant\u2019s claim incredible (see GD at [95]). We turn to consider this.",
      "121": "For this aspect of the Appellant\u2019s defence, the relevant witnesses were Sufian and Faizal, who could have given evidence as to the contents of the phone calls that the Appellant made to them on the afternoon of 27 January 2016. In short, Sufian and Faizal could have rebutted the Appellant\u2019s claim that he called them that afternoon to ask them to remove the trolley bag and the diamorphine from the Flat, and they agreed. Even though this aspect of the Appellant\u2019s defence was raised for the first time only in his evidence-in-chief, the Prosecution could have called Sufian and Faizal as rebuttal witnesses pursuant to s 230(1)(t) of the CPC, but it failed to do so. Our analysis at [107] above on the Prosecution\u2019s evidential burden and the drawing of an adverse inference applies equally to this point.",
      "122": "This, however, was not the only difficulty we had with this issue. It seems to us that the contents of the phone calls made by the Appellant to Sufian and Faizal on the afternoon of 27 January 2016 were barely explored at the trial, notwithstanding the objective call records which showed that these calls were made. These phone calls ought to have been examined to at least the same extent as the phone calls made from and received on the Appellant\u2019s iPhone on the night of 26 January 2016 while the Appellant was supposedly asleep (see [115] above). However, the Appellant was never challenged, in clear and express terms, that he did not in fact call Sufian and Faizal to ask them to remove the trolley bag and the diamorphine from the Flat, nor did they agree to do so. Instead, the Appellant was only challenged by the learned DPP in the following general terms, and only in respect of Faizal:",
      "123": "In these circumstances, on the evidence before us, there is simply no contrary account of the contents of the phone calls apart from that of the Appellant. His account would also not be inconsistent with his evidence as to his past interactions with Faizal (see [100] above).",
      "124": "Mr Jumabhoy, in fairness, suggested that the significance of the Appellant\u2019s defence, namely, that he was holding the trolley bag and the diamorphine intending only to return them to their owners, might not have been in the minds of the parties and the Judge at the trial, given that our judgment in Ramesh ([28] supra) was delivered around three months after the Judge had convicted and sentenced the Appellant on the two trafficking charges. This, Mr Jumabhoy suggested, might explain why the Prosecution did not challenge the Appellant\u2019s evidence as to the purpose of his phone calls to Sufian and Faizal on the afternoon of 27 January 2016. As to this, we have two observations. First, by the same token, the Appellant and his counsel too would not have appreciated the legal significance of the point, and this lends credence to the Appellant\u2019s account of the events. But, second, if the overall narrative were accepted that the drugs were brought to the Flat by others, and that on discovering their presence, the Appellant called those whom he suspected were responsible to remove them, we fail to see how this could possibly have been thought not to be relevant.",
      "125": "We next consider the DNA evidence and whether that pointed to the Appellant being involved in the packing of the diamorphine. If so, it would indicate that, contrary to what the Appellant claimed, he did not possess the diamorphine solely for the purpose of returning it to Sufian and/or Faizal. We first briefly describe the 64 packets of diamorphine which formed the subject matter of the first charge:\n(a)     Sixty-three packets of diamorphine were found in the Akira box (F1).\n(i)       The Akira box contained three large packets of diamorphine (F1A, F1B and F1C).\n(ii)       The Akira box also contained two plastic bags (F1D and F1E).\n(A)       Each plastic bag contained three medium-sized Ziploc bags (F1D1, F1D2 and F1D3, and F1E1, F1E2 and F1E3 respectively).\n(B)       In turn, the six medium-sized Ziploc bags each contained a group of ten mini packets of diamorphine (F1D1A, F1D2A, F1D3A, F1E1A, F1E2A and F1E3A). There were thus a total of 60 mini packets of diamorphine. F1D3A consisted of a group of ten mini packets of diamorphine.\n(b)     The remaining packet of diamorphine (G1A1) was contained in a plastic bag (G1A) in the Mintek bag (G1).",
      "126": "Of the 64 packets of diamorphine, the Appellant\u2019s DNA was found only on the exterior surface of F1D3A, which, we reiterate, was a group of ten mini packets of diamorphine. This leads to a particular ambiguity concerning the probative value of the DNA evidence which we address below. The Judge relied significantly on the presence of the Appellant\u2019s DNA on the exterior surface of F1D3A to find that he was involved in packing the diamorphine and, therefore, involved in trafficking. The Judge reasoned that there were multiple layers of external packaging before one could come into contact with F1D3A, and it was thus \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that the Appellant\u2019s DNA could have been found on the exterior surface of F1D3A by \u201caccidental touching\u201d (see GD at [73] and [94]).",
      "127": "We respectfully disagree with the Judge\u2019s finding. In our judgment, the DNA evidence adduced at the trial was insufficient to show that the Appellant was involved in packing the diamorphine.",
      "128": "We state at the outset that although the Appellant\u2019s DNA was found on the exterior surface of F1D3A, it is unclear from the evidence before us whether his DNA was found on the exterior surfaces of all the ten mini packets of diamorphine that made up F1D3A. This is because the swabs from F1D3A that were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cthe HSA\u201d) for analysis were not swabs of the individual mini packets. Rather, as Mr Jumabhoy pointed out to us, ASP Peh Zhen Hao (\u201cASP Peh\u201d) testified that the ten mini packets constituting F1D3A were swabbed \u201ccollectively\u201d. In the circumstances, it is unsafe to conclude that the Appellant\u2019s DNA was found on the exterior surfaces of all the ten mini packets. It is equally possible that the Appellant\u2019s DNA was found only on the exterior surface of one of the ten mini packets. It is unclear to us whether the Judge appreciated this distinction in her analysis of the DNA evidence.",
      "129": "This point is a significant one when we consider whether there were reasonable explanations for the presence of the Appellant\u2019s DNA on the exterior surface of F1D3A, apart from his having been involved in the packing of the diamorphine. We accept that the absence of the Appellant\u2019s DNA on the exterior surfaces of the other packets of diamorphine does not conclusively prove that he was not involved in packing them (see Gopu Jaya Raman ([92] supra) at [82]). Nevertheless, this has to be considered as a whole in the context of the coherence of the case advanced by the Appellant. Here, the fact that there were no widespread traces of the Appellant\u2019s DNA on the exterior surfaces of the 64 packets of diamorphine weakens the inference that the Prosecution sought to draw, namely, that the Appellant was involved in packing the diamorphine. Further, the presence of the Appellant\u2019s DNA in an isolated area also increases the likelihood that there were other reasonable explanations for this, apart from his involvement in the packing of the diamorphine. In our judgment, there were at least two other reasonable explanations.",
      "130": "The first was an explanation which was implicit in the account of the events given by the Appellant. In short, the Appellant testified that he saw the six medium-sized Ziploc bags laid out on the bed in Bedroom 1 at around 2.00pm on 27 January 2016 (see [11] above). As we have mentioned, F1D3A consisted of a group of ten mini packets of diamorphine which were contained in one of these Ziploc bags, F1D3. There was a single layer, not multiple layers, separating F1D3 and F1D3A. According to the Appellant, he got into a quarrel with his wife shortly after he saw the six medium-sized Ziploc bags. He then placed all six Ziploc bags, among other items, into the Akira box (see [11] above). It does not seem to us that any attention was directed to whether the Appellant\u2019s DNA could have come into contact with the contents of F1D3 then, for instance, if F1D3 was not entirely closed, especially given that the ten mini packets of diamorphine constituting F1D3A were packed tightly together in F1D3. It was incumbent on the Prosecution to prove that the presence of the Appellant\u2019s DNA on the exterior surface of F1D3A was consistent only with his having packed its contents, and not because he had handled the packets of diamorphine when he placed them into the Akira box. Yet, beyond simply putting it to the Appellant in a formalistic way that he must have packed the diamorphine because his DNA was found on the exterior surface of F1D3A, the Prosecution did not explore any of these points in any meaningful way when cross-examining the Appellant.",
      "131": "There was another even more plausible explanation as to why the Appellant\u2019s DNA was found on the exterior surface of F1D3A, which first requires an understanding of how the diamorphine was handled in the Flat by Sgt Farhan and SSgt Chua:\n(a)     Before us, the learned DPP, Mr Lau, explained that typically, during a search and seizure operation, the CNB officers would unpack the drugs found into their separate components to label and itemise the exhibits. This would be done at the location where the drugs were seized. Indeed, Sgt Farhan confirmed this \u201cnormal practice\u201d under cross-examination, although he could not specifically remember if it was adhered to in the present case. Nonetheless, Mr Lau rightly acknowledged that there was nothing to indicate that the normal practice was not observed in this case.\n(b)     Thus, from the Akira box, the three large packets of diamorphine and the two plastic bags would have been taken out. From the two plastic bags, the six medium-sized Ziploc bags would have been taken out, and then so too would the 60 mini packets of diamorphine contained in the Ziploc bags have been taken out.\n(c)     Throughout this process, both Sgt Farhan and SSgt Chua would have been wearing gloves. However, Sgt Farhan\u2019s DNA was found on the exterior surface of F1E3. When questioned, Sgt Farhan explained that there was a \u201cprobability\u201d that his saliva had come into contact with the exterior surface of F1E3 as he could not recall whether he had been wearing a mask at the time. Sgt Farhan\u2019s DNA must have come into contact with the exterior surface of F1E3 while he was at the Flat as the drugs were subsequently sealed in separate tamper-proof bags and handed over to other CNB officers.",
      "132": "By parity of reasoning, it seems equally possible that the Appellant\u2019s DNA might have been accidentally deposited on the exterior surface of F1D3A while the CNB officers were in the Flat and in their presence, particularly after the contents of the various bundles were all unpacked. After all, the diamorphine was unpacked in the Flat, and traces of the Appellant\u2019s DNA could well have come into contact with the exterior surface of F1D3A innocently. For example, the very same explanation provided by SSgt Farhan, namely, the transmission of DNA through saliva, could have accounted for the presence of the Appellant\u2019s DNA on the exterior surface of F1D3A, especially considering that his contemporaneous statements were recorded in Bedroom 1 itself.",
      "133": "For these reasons, we are not satisfied that the presence of the Appellant\u2019s DNA on the exterior surface of F1D3A pointed irresistibly to the conclusion that he was involved in packing the diamorphine into the 64 packets. We pause to note that the Appellant\u2019s DNA, apart from being found on the exterior surface of F1D3A, was also found on the exterior surface of F1E3 (one of the six medium-sized Ziploc bags), the exterior surface of G1 (the Mintek bag) as well as the exterior and interior surfaces of G1A (the plastic bag in the Mintek bag). The presence of the Appellant\u2019s DNA on these exhibits was not directly probative of the fact that he was involved in packing the diamorphine because these exhibits did not themselves constitute any of the 64 packets of diamorphine that were the subject matter of the first charge, even though they contained some of the packets in question (see [124] above). Further, the presence of the Appellant\u2019s DNA on the exterior surface of F1E3 would be consistent with his claim that he had placed the six medium-sized Ziploc bags (along with other items) into the Akira box after getting into a quarrel with Mashitta, which contention the Judge rejected (see GD at [75]).",
      "134": "It is convenient here to deal with another point concerning F1D3A. The Prosecution produced a report from the HSA which stated that the mini plastic bags used to pack the mini packets of diamorphine constituting F1D3A were manufactured by the same machine as that which was used to manufacture certain unused mini plastic bags which were seized from Bedroom 1 (J2A). Under cross-examination, the Appellant accepted that J2A belonged to him. Mr Lau submitted that the inference to be drawn from this was that the Appellant was involved in packing the diamorphine.",
      "135": "However, it was not put to the Appellant that because the mini plastic bags used to pack the mini packets of diamorphine constituting F1D3A came from the \u201csame stock\u201d as the mini plastic bags constituting J2A, which belonged to him, it meant that he must have been involved in packing the diamorphine. This point was of such a nature and of such importance that, pursuant to the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67, it should have been put to the Appellant to give him the opportunity to address it before it was made as a submission by the Prosecution, which Mr Lau rightly conceded at the hearing before us. This was a significant omission, especially because there was another plausible explanation as to why the diamorphine had been packed using mini plastic bags that belonged to the Appellant, which would have been entirely consistent with the Appellant\u2019s defence that (among other things) the diamorphine had been left in the Flat on 26 January 2016 without his knowledge \u2013 namely, the diamorphine had been packed by Sufian and/or Faizal in Bedroom 1 using the empty mini plastic bags constituting J2A, which were in Bedroom 1 to begin with.",
      "136": "In that light, we are left with the Appellant\u2019s account, which is that:\n(a)     He did not know that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016.\n(b)     When Faizal arrived at the Flat at about 8.20pm on 26 January 2016, he was asleep, and Faizal was let in by the Helper, who took the trolley bag from Faizal and kept it in the storeroom.\n(c)     Although phone calls were made from and received on his iPhone at the time he was supposedly asleep, his iPhone was in Bedroom 1 then and Sufian could have been using it.\n(d)     He discovered several packets of diamorphine on the bed in Bedroom 1 the following afternoon (that is to say, on the afternoon of 27 January 2016), and after a row with his wife, he put the packets into the Akira box. He also discovered the trolley bag in the storeroom that same afternoon.\n(e)     He then called Faizal and Sufian asking them to remove the trolley bag and the drugs from the Flat, and they agreed (see [97]\u2013[98] above).",
      "137": "None of these aspects of the Appellant\u2019s defence was inherently incredible. Much of this account by the Appellant had already been put across in his statements to the CNB. In our judgment, this was sufficient to shift the evidential burden to the Prosecution. The Prosecution had access to each of the witnesses \u2013 Faizal, Sufian, Mashitta and the Helper \u2013 who were directly referred to in the Appellant\u2019s narrative and who could have confirmed or, conversely, contradicted that narrative in material respects. The Prosecution also had the statements that had been recorded from these witnesses. The Prosecution declined all the Appellant\u2019s requests for a number of these statements; it also failed to call these witnesses. In these circumstances, we are satisfied that the Prosecution failed to discharge its evidential burden to rebut the Appellant\u2019s defence (see [68]\u2013[71] above).",
      "138": "We therefore accept the Appellant\u2019s assertion that he had the diamorphine in his possession solely for the purpose of returning it to Sufian and/or Faizal, and find that he has rebutted the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA where the first charge of trafficking in the diamorphine is concerned. In the circumstances, we set aside his conviction on this charge.",
      "139": "We had earlier directed the Supreme Court Registry to seek the confirmation of the parties that in the event that this court allowed the Appellant\u2019s appeal against his conviction on the first charge, they would agree to this court amending this charge to one of possession of the diamorphine under s 8(a) of the MDA. Mr Jumabhoy had intimated as much during the hearing before us. For the purposes of s 390 of the CPC, we also sought confirmation from the Appellant that if the first charge were amended as stated, he did not intend to offer a defence to the amended charge.",
      "140": "Having received the parties\u2019 agreement and the confirmation sought, we amend the first charge to one of possession of the diamorphine under s 8(a) of the MDA. The Appellant accepts that he had possession and knowledge of the diamorphine, and we thus convict him on the amended charge accordingly.",
      "141": "In considering the appropriate sentence to impose on the Appellant in respect of the amended charge, we take into account the fact that the Appellant knew that he was in possession of a large quantity of diamorphine (not less than 63.41g). Notwithstanding that he was waiting for Sufian and/or Faizal to remove the diamorphine from the Flat, he must have known that he was committing an act that was connected to the illicit circulation of drugs. He knew, in particular, that Faizal was a supplier of drugs, and he must have known that the drugs would be put back into circulation after they were removed from the Flat. At the same time, this was not a case where the Appellant was safekeeping the diamorphine for Sufian and/or Faizal pursuant to an agreed plan. Instead, the diamorphine was left in the Flat without the Appellant\u2019s knowledge, and he called the relevant individuals to ask them to remove it as soon as possible once he discovered it. In all the circumstances, we consider that a sentence of eight years\u2019 imprisonment, backdated to the date of the Appellant\u2019s remand, would be appropriate, and we sentence the Appellant accordingly on the amended charge.",
      "142": "We turn now to whether the Judge was right in finding that the Appellant was guilty of the second charge of trafficking in the cannabis. To reiterate, the Appellant\u2019s position on appeal is that he had possession of the trolley bag, but he believed that it contained cigarettes (instead of the cannabis), and he only had the trolley bag in his possession for the purpose of returning it to Faizal, who had left it at the Flat (see [29] above).",
      "143": "Turning, first, to the element of possession, the Appellant, as we have just mentioned, does not dispute this. In our judgment, he was right not to. The Appellant had physical possession, control or custody of the substance in the trolley bag that turned out to be the cannabis, and he knew of the existence of that substance, whatever it might eventually turn out to be (see Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor [2019] 2 SLR 254 (\u201cAdili\u201d) at [31]).",
      "144": "The next question is whether the Appellant has rebutted the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs under s 18(2) of the MDA. Where an accused person denies such knowledge, it is incumbent on him to state what he thought was in his possession, and the court will assess the credibility and veracity of his claim against the objective facts and his actions relating to the item in question (see Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor [2017] 1 SLR 633 at [40]).",
      "145": "The Judge found that the Appellant knew that the trolley bag contained the cannabis (see [25] above). She rejected his defence that he thought the trolley bag contained cigarettes instead of drugs. In reaching this conclusion, there were two key findings that she made: first, the Appellant knew that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016; and second, the Appellant had directed the CNB officers to the storeroom after the diamorphine was seized from Bedroom 1 because he knew that there were drugs in the trolley bag, which was in the storeroom (see GD at [63] and [90]).",
      "146": "We address the second point below. As for the first point, we have dealt with this in the context of the first charge (see [104]\u2013[114] above). In short, we see no reason to reject the Appellant\u2019s evidence that he did not know that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016, and only discovered the trolley bag in the Flat the next day. He did not open the trolley bag. Thereafter, he called Faizal (as well as Sufian) to ask him to remove the trolley bag from the Flat, and Faizal (and likewise Sufian) agreed.",
      "147": "For present purposes, we should stress that there is also no reason for us to disbelieve the Appellant\u2019s defence that he was told by Faizal that the trolley bag contained cigarettes. Indeed, Faizal had evidently left cigarettes in the Flat previously (see [13] above). In line with our analysis for the first charge, we note that the Prosecution could have called Faizal to rebut the Appellant\u2019s defence, but it failed to do so. The points concerning the Prosecution\u2019s evidential burden and the drawing of adverse inferences (see [68]\u2013[77] above) apply to the second charge equally.",
      "148": "We turn to the evidence in respect of the Appellant\u2019s directing the CNB officers to the storeroom after the diamorphine was seized from Bedroom 1. The Judge relied on this to reach the conclusion that the Appellant knew that the trolley bag contained drugs and not cigarettes (see GD at [63]).",
      "149": "We begin by setting out the salient facts.",
      "150": "The search of Bedroom 1, where the diamorphine was found, concluded at around 8.40pm on 27 January 2016. At around 9.45pm, Senior SSgt Ika asked the Appellant a question. The precise question asked was disputed. Senior SSgt Ika testified that he asked the Appellant \u201cada lagi\u201d (which means \u201cstill some more?\u201d). On the other hand, the Appellant provided three versions of the question that was asked: \u201cada barang salah\u201d (which means \u201cany illegal things?\u201d), \u201cada barang salah lagi\u201d (which means any \u201cany more illegal things?\u201d) and \u201cada barang lagi\u201d (which means \u201cany more things?\u201d). Whatever the precise question, the Appellant answered \u201cstoreroom\u201d and was escorted there. The CNB officers thereafter found the cannabis in the trolley bag.",
      "151": "The Judge found that the Appellant\u2019s version of Senior SSgt Ika\u2019s question \u201ckept evolving\u201d, whereas Senior SSgt Ika was \u201cconsistent in his testimony\u201d as to the question asked (see GD at [63]). With respect, given that the particular issue of just what the Appellant was asked was only explored at the trial some two and a half years after the relevant events in the Flat, we do not think it is fair to fault the Appellant for not remembering the precise question asked by Senior SSgt Ika. In fact, Senior SSgt Ika himself was not absolutely certain of the question asked. His precise evidence was that \u201cI think it\u2019s \u2018ada lagi\u2019 because I usually keep the questions short and simple\u201d [emphasis added]. Further, it appears that the question was unfortunately not documented in Senior SSgt Ika\u2019s pocketbook as there would otherwise have been no need for Senior SSgt Ika to speculate about the precise question asked.",
      "152": "More importantly, regardless of the precise question asked, it is not disputed that Senior SSgt Ika did not expressly refer to drugs in his question. We are therefore content to proceed with the analysis on the assumption that the question asked was \u201cada lagi\u201d, although we note that there was nothing in the evidence to help resolve this ambiguity. The more pertinent point, in our judgment, is what the Appellant understood from Senior SSgt Ika\u2019s question. On this point, the Prosecution put it to the Appellant that he understood the question to mean \u201cany more drugs\u201d or \u201cstill some more drugs\u201d. The Appellant disagreed. His position, which he maintained consistently, was that he was directing the CNB officers to the contraband cigarettes in the storeroom. It is not disputed that contraband cigarettes were indeed seized from the storeroom by the CNB officers and thereafter handed over to Singapore Customs.",
      "153": "The Judge found that the context supported the inference that the Appellant understood Senior SSgt Ika to be asking whether there were any more drugs in the Flat. We disagree for the following reasons.",
      "154": "First, the Judge observed that Senior SSgt Ika asked the Appellant the question after Bedroom 1 had been searched and a large amount of diamorphine uncovered there. This, however, does not take into account the fact that Senior SSgt Ika\u2019s question was asked more than an hour after the diamorphine was seized. The inference that the Appellant understood Senior SSgt Ika to be asking whether there were any more drugs in the Flat might have been a more compelling one if the Appellant had been asked the question immediately after the diamorphine was found. Further, there was little evidence as to what transpired during the intervening one hour, except for some evidence that the CNB officers had allowed the Appellant to call Sufian at around 9.31pm.",
      "155": "Second, the Judge also pointed out that the Appellant was aware that the officers were from the CNB and were conducting a raid for drugs rather than contraband cigarettes. With hindsight, it might seem logical to expect that the CNB would, in the course of a raid for drugs, focus on drugs and not contraband cigarettes. But this is hardly determinative of the issue. Indeed, as we have noted, the CNB officers did seize the contraband cigarettes that were found in the storeroom. But this is a distinct point from the one that is more pertinent to the facts before us, which is that since the Appellant knew that the CNB officers were conducting a raid for drugs, it would not have been unreasonable for him to think that he should come clean on other illegal items stored in the Flat.",
      "156": "Third, there was some dispute at the trial as to what, if anything, the Appellant had pointed to in response to Senior SSgt Ika\u2019s question. Whatever it was, when the CNB officers seized the trolley bag, they never asked the Appellant what was in it. The CNB officers had instead removed several blocks of vegetable matter from the trolley bag and asked the Appellant whether he knew what they were and whether they belonged to him. While the Appellant recognised that the blocks of vegetable matter were cannabis, he denied that they belonged to him.",
      "157": "In these circumstances, it seems to us that on no account can it be concluded, solely on the basis of the question asked by Senior SSgt Ika and the Appellant\u2019s response, that he knew that the trolley bag contained the cannabis. This is why the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the Appellant had the requisite knowledge of the nature of the drugs rested in material part on her finding that he knew that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016. We have explained why we do not accept that finding.",
      "158": "What we are left with then is the Appellant\u2019s account of what had transpired in respect of Faizal\u2019s bringing the trolley bag to the Flat. That account included his assertion that he thought the trolley bag contained cigarettes, which was what Faizal had told him and which Faizal apparently did bring from time to time. This was not inherently incredible, and it shifted the evidential burden to the Prosecution, but nothing at all was led by the Prosecution in the way of evidence to discharge that burden. Accordingly, for the reasons set out above, we are satisfied that the Appellant has rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA where the second charge is concerned. The question of trafficking therefore does not arise in relation to this charge. In any event, the element of possession of the cannabis for the purpose of trafficking would not have been made out for the same reasons as those we have given in relation to the first charge.",
      "159": "In the circumstances, we allow the Appellant\u2019s appeal in relation to the second charge of trafficking in the cannabis and acquit him of it. To be clear, as the Prosecution has, in our judgment, failed to establish that the Appellant knew that the trolley bag contained the cannabis, he cannot be found guilty even of an offence of possession of the cannabis under s 8(a) of the MDA.",
      "160": "For completeness, we note that the Prosecution did not run an alternative case based on wilful blindness at the trial, neither did it seek to raise any arguments concerning wilful blindness on appeal. Instead, the Prosecution\u2019s primary case was that it had proved that the Appellant had actual knowledge of the cannabis. In the alternative, the Prosecution submitted that the Appellant was presumed to have knowledge of the cannabis by virtue of s 18(2) of the MDA (see GD at [44]). It is thus not necessary to consider whether the Appellant was wilfully blind to the cannabis in the trolley bag in the present case.",
      "161": "However, our preliminary view is that the doctrine of wilful blindness would not have been engaged in the present case even if the Prosecution had run a case based on it.",
      "162": "There is nothing before us to suggest that the Appellant deliberately refused to check the contents of the trolley bag in the face of suspicion in order to cheat the administration of justice (see Adili ([142] supra) at [66]). Here, the evidence indicated that the Appellant did check with Faizal what was in the trolley bag and also told him to remove it from the Flat. Faizal informed the Appellant that the trolley bag contained cigarettes and also agreed to remove it from the Flat. There was no reason for the Appellant to disbelieve Faizal. On his case, the Appellant was not a courier who was transporting goods and who would therefore be bound to check what it was that he was transporting. We leave it at that since the point was not taken by the Prosecution.",
      "163": "We turn finally to the last issue, which is whether there was excessive judicial interference at the trial. The Appellant submitted that there were numerous examples of the Judge \u201cdescending into the arena\u201d and \u201ctaking over the conduct of the questioning of witnesses\u201d, and the impression thus given was that her vision had been \u201cclouded by the dust of the conflict\u201d (an expression taken from the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Yuill v Yuill [1945] P 15 (\u201cYuill\u201d) at 20). The Appellant submitted that the Judge did not merely ask clarificatory questions, but instead engaged in long and sustained bouts of questioning, and her interventions were at times at crucial points which interrupted counsel\u2019s line of questioning. Nevertheless, the Appellant did not suggest that the Judge was biased. Mr Jumabhoy also clarified that he was not seeking for the matter to be reheard before another judge. Rather, Mr Jumabhoy submitted that, in fairness to the Appellant, we should convict him only of what we were satisfied was safe to convict him of in all the circumstances, and that would be an amended charge of possession of the diamorphine under s 8(a) of the MDA. Mr Jumabhoy submitted that the Appellant should accordingly be acquitted of the two capital trafficking charges to which he had claimed trial.",
      "164": "For the reasons explained above, this indeed is the result we have been driven to, having examined the evidence. That makes it strictly unnecessary for us to consider and rule upon the issue of excessive judicial interference. We do not, in any event, accept Mr Jumabhoy\u2019s submissions as to the Judge\u2019s conduct of the trial. Nonetheless, we take this opportunity to set out the applicable principles in relation to a judge\u2019s conduct of criminal proceedings.",
      "165": "It is helpful to begin by reiterating that a complaint of excessive judicial interference ought not to be conflated with a complaint of apparent bias. We explained the distinction between the two concepts in BOI v BOJ [2018] 2 SLR 1156 (\u201cBOI\u201d) in the following terms (at [112]):",
      "166": "Properly construed, the ground of excessive judicial interference is concerned with the failure of the court to observe its proper role and its duty not to descend into the arena (see BOI at [112]). At the same time, judges are fully entitled to pose questions to witnesses and counsel in order to understand and clarify the evidence and the issues in dispute. In this regard, we stated the following principles in Mohammed Ali bin Johari v Public Prosecutor [2008] 4 SLR(R) 1058 (\u201cMohammed Ali\u201d) at [175]:",
      "167": "Thus, for excessive judicial interference to be established, it would generally be necessary to show that the situation was \u201can egregious one\u201d [emphasis in original] (see Mohammed Ali at [175(g)]). Plainly, where a complaint of excessive judicial interference is made on appeal, the appellate court will consider whether the court below has in fact acted in a manner that has resulted in actual prejudice to the relevant party; the relevant inquiry is not whether a fair-minded person would reasonably suspect or apprehend that the court below was biased (see BOI at [112]). Actual prejudice could, for instance, arise if a judge intervenes in the proceedings to such an extent that it prevents a party from presenting its case.",
      "168": "As to whether there was excessive judicial interference in the present case, having examined the record of the proceedings and considered Mr Jumabhoy\u2019s submissions most carefully, we are satisfied that there was not. While the Judge did direct a fair number of questions during the trial to various witnesses, including the Appellant, in our judgment, it was plain that she did so in an effort to ensure that she had correctly understood the evidence. This was especially warranted in this case, where the questions put by counsel who appeared at the trial were at times wanting in specificity and/or clarity.",
      "169": "We do not think it is necessary or helpful to list the various instances where it was suggested that the Judge interfered excessively. However, quite apart from his general contentions regarding excessive judicial interference, there was one distinct point made by Mr Jumabhoy that we think ought to be highlighted. This was the point that the Judge ought not to have required the Appellant to give advance notice of his case before he had been called to give his defence. In brief terms, when counsel was cross-examining ASP Peh on the swabbing process for F1D3A (see [127] above), the Judge intervened to ask what the Appellant\u2019s case was as to whether the Appellant had touched the ten mini packets of diamorphine constituting F1D3A. The Judge then asked counsel to take the Appellant\u2019s instructions as to where the various packets of diamorphine were in Bedroom 1 and counsel did not object. While there was nothing objectionable about these questions in so far as they were asked by the Judge to understand the Appellant\u2019s defence, the issue was one of timing. With respect, the Judge ought to have asked these questions only after the Appellant had been called to give his defence following the close of the Prosecution\u2019s case. Even so, we are amply satisfied that this did not result in any actual prejudice to the Appellant so as to constitute impermissible or excessive judicial interference.",
      "170": "Notwithstanding our view that there was no excessive judicial interference in this case, given the importance of this issue, we think it would be useful to provide some guidance on the applicable principles which ought to guide a judge\u2019s conduct in the specific context of criminal proceedings. These principles ought to apply with especial force in criminal matters, where the implications of excessive judicial interference on an accused person\u2019s life and liberty may be severe.",
      "171": "We highlight below six points that a judge must generally be mindful of and, more broadly, the need for a judge to exercise greater caution, prudence and restraint in conducting criminal proceedings as compared to civil proceedings. These points are, of course, not intended to be exhaustive.",
      "172": "First, in criminal proceedings, it is the Prosecution\u2019s burden to prove its case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt. As we have repeatedly emphasised in our recent decisions, it is for the Prosecution, and not the judge, to fill in any gaps in the Prosecution\u2019s case (see Mohamed Affandi bin Rosli v Public Prosecutor and another appeal [2019] 1 SLR 440 at [52]; Ramesh ([28] supra) at [1]\u2013[2]). As we explained in Mui Jia Jun v Public Prosecutor [2018] 2 SLR 1087 (\u201cMui Jia Jun\u201d) at [76]:",
      "173": "This is not least because while the Prosecution is charged with a number of significant burdens (such as having to prove its case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt), it has access to the police, the investigating authorities, as well as witnesses and their statements, and is also armed with and assisted by various tools (such as statutory presumptions). It follows then that a judge should not ask questions that would reasonably be seen as having the effect of filling for the Prosecution gaps in its case. In this regard, we endorse Lee Seiu Kin J\u2019s observations in Ng Chee Tiong Tony v Public Prosecutor [2008] 1 SLR(R) 900 (\u201cNg Chee Tiong Tony\u201d) as follows at [22]:",
      "174": "Second, in criminal proceedings, there are strict rules of procedure which provide that it is for the Prosecution to first prove a prima facie case before the Defence may be called or even invited to set out material aspects of its position. Section 230(1)(j) of the CPC provides that the court may only call on an accused person to give his defence if it is satisfied that there is some evidence which is not inherently incredible and which, if accepted, would satisfy each and every element of the charge against the accused person. In the course of the Prosecution\u2019s case, a judge should therefore not ask questions of the Defence which would require the accused person to give advance notice of his case before he is called to give his defence, given that at this stage, the Prosecution would have yet to discharge its burden to prove a prima facie case.",
      "175": "Third, we turn to the Prosecution\u2019s task of presenting its case at the trial. The court clearly does not have access to all the information that the police or other investigating authorities will have gathered over the course of the investigations, which information the Prosecution will have had access to. Accordingly, if the Prosecution chooses not to explore certain lines of inquiry with its witnesses or advance certain case theories, there might be good reasons for its choices, which the trial judge might not fully appreciate (see Mui Jia Jun at [77]). The judge should, for this reason, ordinarily refrain from exploring other lines of inquiry.",
      "176": "Fourth, we turn to the accused person and the giving of his evidence-in-chief at the trial. Unlike a party to a civil matter who gives his evidence-in-chief by affidavit, an accused person gives his evidence-in-chief orally at the trial. There are at least two reasons why a judge should exercise considerable restraint in intervening at this stage, as observed by the English Court of Appeal in Regina v Gavin Inns, Emma Inns [2018] EWCA Crim 1081 (\u201cGavin Inns\u201d). The first is that it is not a judge\u2019s role to cross-examine an accused person. Rather, it is the Prosecution\u2019s role to do so, and that will, of course, be done after the accused person has finished giving his evidence-in-chief (see Gavin Inns at [36]). Second, an accused person should have the opportunity to give his account in the way that he would like his evidence to come out, \u201celicited though questions from [his] own advocate\u201d, without constant interruptions that may prevent him from doing so (see Gavin Inns at [37]).",
      "177": "Moreover, as we have just noted, in criminal proceedings, parties do not set out their cases before the trial in the way that it is done in civil proceedings. In civil proceedings, the issues in dispute are typically set out in the pleadings and the contest is quite clearly defined. With the witnesses\u2019 evidence-in-chief given by affidavit, there is much less risk of a witness not having the opportunity to give his account in the manner that he wants to. It is thus important for a trial judge to be conscious of the need to exercise greater restraint in criminal proceedings when questioning an accused person during his evidence-in-chief.",
      "178": "Fifth, courts have repeatedly observed that witnesses generally tend to enter the witness box in a nervous state, and this would apply with greater force to an accused person whose life and liberty is at stake. The words of the English Court of Appeal in R v Kolliari Mehmet Hulusi (1973) 58 Cr App R 378 at 385, which we cited in Mohammed Ali ([165] supra) at [131], bear repetition:",
      "179": "We italicised a portion of the above extract because it is important for a judge to remember that he or she will most likely have a very different effect on a witness as compared to the cross-examining counsel. Citing Yuill ([162] supra), Lee J made a similar observation in Ng Chee Tiong Tony ([172] supra) at [22]:",
      "180": "In these circumstances, it would not be far-fetched to suggest that there might be a tendency for an accused person to present himself as agreeably as possible to the judge so as not to upset him or her. The Malaysian Court of Appeal in Ahmad Norizan bin Mohamad v Public Prosecutor [2017] 6 MLJ 326 made a similar point at [24]:",
      "181": "Sixth, a judge should refrain from asking leading questions generally as it may help a party with the direct examination or cross-examination of a witness, especially a material witness. In Ng Chee Tiong Tony, the trial judge seemed to have taken a position and pursued it in her questioning of the appellant; she framed her questions from the position that the appellant was not telling the truth (at [23] and [25]); she asked almost as many questions as the prosecutor, and many of her questions were leading questions and/or in the nature of cross-examination (at [5], [8] and [24]); a number of points that she raised had not been surfaced by the prosecutor in his cross-examination of the appellant; based on the appellant\u2019s answers to her questioning, she then made crucial adverse findings of fact in her grounds of decision, particularly in relation to the appellant\u2019s credibility as a witness (at [23]). In these circumstances, it was unsurprising that Lee J quashed the appellant\u2019s conviction.",
      "182": "The six points outlined above are not remarkable ones, and we have every confidence that trial judges in all our courts apply them each and every day in each and every case that they try. Nonetheless, we think a reminder to all those involved in criminal proceedings \u2013 judges, prosecutors and defence counsel \u2013 would not be out of place.",
      "183": "In summary, having examined the facts and the evidence before us, we allow the Appellant\u2019s appeal in relation to the first charge of trafficking in the diamorphine, and convict him on an amended charge of possession of the diamorphine under s 8(a) of the MDA. We sentence him to a term of eight years\u2019 imprisonment, backdated to the date of his remand, on the amended charge.",
      "184": "Further, we allow the Appellant\u2019s appeal in relation to the second charge of trafficking in the cannabis and acquit him of it.",
      "185": "We briefly mention one remaining matter.",
      "186": "At the hearing of the appeal, the Prosecution submitted that it would disclose to the Defence the statements of Sufian, Faizal, Mashitta and the Helper if we held that it was under a duty to do so. In that event, if the Defence decided to call these witnesses, it was suggested that the matter could be remitted to the Judge pursuant to s 390(1)(b)(i) of the CPC. To be clear, our judgment in this appeal does not turn on the Prosecution\u2019s non-disclosure of these witnesses\u2019 statements. We have found that it was the Prosecution, and not the Defence, who ought to have called these witnesses, given its evidential burden to rebut the claims made by the Appellant. As the Prosecution has failed to prove that the Appellant is guilty of either of the two capital trafficking charges that it brought against him, there is simply no basis for this matter to be remitted to the Judge."
