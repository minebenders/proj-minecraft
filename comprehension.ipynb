    "    \"passage\": \"The trial judges accepted that both the appellants had come into Singapore only with a view to boarding a flight to Amsterdam the next day. They, however, rejected the submission made on behalf of the appellants that bringing drugs into Singapore with a view solely of exporting them would not be an offence under s 7 of the Act. They also rejected Ko’s defence that he did not know that what he was carrying was diamorphine. Accordingly, they convicted the appellants. Against the convictions, this appeal was brought. At the conclusion we dismissed it, and we now give our reasons.Ground (a) can be disposed of very briefly. By s 18(2) of the Act a rebuttable presumption arose that Ko knew the nature of the drug that he was carrying. Once the presumption arose, the onus of discharging it was on Ko. Having heard Ko’s defence, the trial judges were satisfied that he had not discharged the presumption. We have reviewed the record and it is clear that the trial judges were entitled on the evidence before them to arrive at this finding. We saw no reason to interfere.and submitted that s 7 was applicable only when it was sought to punish a master or captain who had contravened s 20. We could not accept that submission. In common with a number of other similar provisions in the Act, what s 20 does is to raise a presumption as to knowledge. By s 20, if it is proved that a drug was found in a ship or aircraft, then the presumption would arise that the drug was imported in the ship or aircraft with the knowledge of the master or captain. No doubt, in such a case, a master or captain may be charged for violating s 7 of the Act but that does not mean to say that s 7 is confined in its operations only to the master of a ship or captain of an aircraft used for the import of drugs. We see no reason why s 7 should not operate against (say) a passenger in a ship or aircraft who was importing drugs. Against such a passenger the presumption under s 20 as to knowledge would obviously not be applicable but (as in this case) the presumption under s 18(2) would apply.\",\n",

      " In the premises, we found the charge against the appellant established beyond a reasonable doubt and dismissed the appeal. Wan quite clearly stated that he received only one red plastic bag that day on the ground floor lift lobby of Block 106. There was no other transaction. The evidence of the CNB officers as to what they witnessed that day at Block 106 was consistent with that. By the operation of s 30 of the Evidence Act, the confessions of Wan could be used to incriminate his co-accused, the appellant: see Chin Seow Noi v PP[27] supra). In the light of Wan’s statements, as well as the statement of the appellant that he did pass a red plastic bag to Wan (albeit that he said it contained clothes), the inference which could reasonably be drawn was that the plastic bag which the appellant had given to Wan had, to his knowledge, contained the prohibited drugs. We, therefore, agreed with the trial judge that a prima facie case had been established that there was a common intention between the appellant and Wan to put the latter in possession of the said drugs. The appellant was rightly called upon to enter his defence. The last sentence in the above extract clearly had the test propounded in Ang Sunny v PP [1965–1967] SLR(R) 123 in mind, where it was held that before circumstantial evidence could be used to secure an accused’s conviction, it must lead to the irresistible inference and conclusion that the accused committed the crime. But that test was only applicable at the close of the trial and not at the stage of the close of the case for the Prosecution. This was the important distinction drawn in Tan Siew Chay ([41] supra), which was affirmed in PP v Oh Laye Koh [1994] 2 SLR(R) 120. In the light of the authorities on how s 163(1) should be applied, we held that the trial judge did act correctly when he allowed the amendment of the charge. The principle stated in Lee Ngin Kiat v PP ([27] supra) remains applicable. But it should be viewed in the right perspective as in Lee Ngin Kiat this court was concerned with the situation where an appellate court proceeded to amend the charge well after the trial had been concluded. Obviously in that situation, even greater caution must be exercised in permitting an amendment.\n",

That would mean that he had actual possession of the bag with the drugs, that he handed it to Andi and so engaged in the act of trafficking. The Prosecution is entitled to invoke the presumption of knowledge, which has not been rebutted. Akebal’s appeal is therefore without merit and accordingly dismissed. First, there is the consistent testimony of Andi. As we have noted above, Andi identified Akebal as the man who handed him the orange bag that contained the drugs in his contemporaneous statement, which was made several hours before Akebal’s arrest. He subsequently repeated this in his long statement. There was no reason for Andi to falsely implicate Akebal and, prior to the appeal, this had not been suggested. At the appeal, Mr Seah for the first time, attempted to suggest that there might have been a conspiracy to which Andi was a party, to frame Akebal. This had never been explored or suggested at trial. Mr Seah accepted this and candidly admitted that he was just putting forward possible inferences that could be drawn from the evidence and suggested that this should be considered by us before dispensing with the appeal. We see no basis for mounting such a contention. Nonetheless, having regard to the fact that Andi was a co‐accused, we would have been prepared to reconsider the weight of his testimony had this been the sole basis for convicting Akebal. But any such possibility of a conspiracy or of false testimony being led against Akebal, as well as the suggestion that Andi’s identification of Akebal in his contemporaneous statement should be viewed with circumspection because he was having withdrawal symptoms at the time, is not weighty once the surrounding circumstances are considered.\n",

      " The Judges’ Rules referred to in the judgment are the Judges’ Rules then in force in England, and r 7 thereof was identical with r 8 of Sched E to proviso (b) of sub-s (5) of s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code then in force. But sub-s (5) (which was the precursor of the existing sub-s (6) of s 122) and Sched E were introduced to the Criminal Procedure Code by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 1960. Section 121 (now s 122) by sub-s (5) thereof for the first time allowed a statement made at any time by a person who is charged with an offence in the hearing of a police officer of or above the rank of inspector to be admissible in evidence at his trial, but such admission was expressly made subject to two provisos, namely: (a) proviso (a) which was in pari materia with the proviso to the existing s 122(5); and (b) proviso (b) which is as follows: In recording the statements from Tan and Lim respectively, SNO Vijakumar asked them several questions on the statements and the answers were given by them respectively. It was argued by counsel that SNO Vijakumar cross-examined them on the statements recorded, and such cross-examinations were improper and rendered the statements inadmissible. The trial judges considered the evidence and the explanation given by SNO Vijakumar for asking the questions, and held that the questions were not put to them by way of cross-examination. We are unable to agree with the views of the trial judges on this point. In our opinion, the questions asked were more than those truly required for clarification. They were asked with a view to eliciting answers from the maker of the statement which would be evidence favourable to the party questioning. SNO Vijakumar need not have asked, and ought not to have asked, those questions. The purpose of s 122(6) of the CPC is to inform the accused of the charge he is facing and to give him an opportunity of stating any fact on which he intends to rely in his defence in court and further to warn him that if he does not state it then, his silence may give rise to an adverse inference against him. The role of a recording officer is spelt out in s 122(6): to prefer and read out the charge to the accused or to inform him officially of the charge, to serve on him a notice in writing in terms as prescribed in that subsection, to explain the notice to him, and thereafter if the accused wishes to say anything, to record accurately what he says. It is no part of the duty of such recording officer to ask the accused any question in relation to what he said. In our opinion, any cross-examination conducted by a recording officer on the statement taken from the accused under s 122(6) is improper, and we disapprove it. Any other form of questioning, unless it is absolutely necessary, is wholly inadvisable and is to be discouraged. Assuming that there was an error made by the trial judges, as contended on behalf of the appellants, in our judgment, no miscarriage of justice at all has occurred in this case. The evidence against Sim was overwhelming, and so also was the evidence against Tan and Lim. Apart from the admissibility of the three statements of the appellants, there was substantially no dispute on the evidence adduced by the Prosecution in any material respect. As for those statements, their admissibility was challenged but the trial judges, after the trial within a trial, were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were made voluntarily, and, accordingly, they were admitted in evidence. In our judgment, on such evidence, the trial judges could not have reached any other conclusion than that the guilt of the appellants had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Plainly, this is a case where the proviso to s 54 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) is applicable. Having reached that conclusion and in view of the fact that the Defence had not tendered any evidence by the appellants or any other witness the trial judges probably considered that it would be tautologous to repeat the same exercise. It seems to us that for that reason they said they had no alternative but to convict the appellants.\n",

      " and submitted that s 7 was applicable only when it was sought to punish a master or captain who had contravened s 20. We could not accept that submission. In common with a number of other similar provisions in the Act, what s 20 does is to raise a presumption as to knowledge. By s 20, if it is proved that a drug was found in a ship or aircraft, then the presumption would arise that the drug was imported in the ship or aircraft with the knowledge of the master or captain. No doubt, in such a case, a master or captain may be charged for violating s 7 of the Act but that does not mean to say that s 7 is confined in its operations only to the master of a ship or captain of an aircraft used for the import of drugs. We see no reason why s 7 should not operate against (say) a passenger in a ship or aircraft who was importing drugs. Against such a passenger the presumption under s 20 as to knowledge would obviously not be applicable but (as in this case) the presumption under s 18(2) would apply. Ground (a) can be disposed of very briefly. By s 18(2) of the Act a rebuttable presumption arose that Ko knew the nature of the drug that he was carrying. Once the presumption arose, the onus of discharging it was on Ko. Having heard Ko’s defence, the trial judges were satisfied that he had not discharged the presumption. We have reviewed the record and it is clear that the trial judges were entitled on the evidence before them to arrive at this finding. We saw no reason to interfere. The trial judges accepted that both the appellants had come into Singapore only with a view to boarding a flight to Amsterdam the next day. They, however, rejected the submission made on behalf of the appellants that bringing drugs into Singapore with a view solely of exporting them would not be an offence under s 7 of the Act.

      " Accordingly, for the reasons given above, we dismissed the appeals and confirmed the sentences imposed by the High Court. In the course of his argument, Mr Lim cited a hypothetical case: John departs from Sydney on board a flight bound for London. He has with him a packet of diamorphine; his intention was to hand over the diamorphine to someone in London. The flight stops over as scheduled in Singapore for refuelling and John remains in the aircraft. On information received, the CNB searches John while he is in the aircraft and finding the diamorphine, charges him with importing drugs. Counsel contended that it would be unjust to convict John of importing drugs. We disagree, for to accept counsel’s argument would be to allow the movement of drugs through Singapore. It is a problem that, if not peculiar to Singapore, is heightened by our geographical location. In our view, to construe “import” so as to exclude the hypothetical example would be to shirk from our responsibilities under the Convention. We see no distinction between the hypothetical example and the situation in Salvador ([28] supra) and agree with the decision in that case. A person does not enter Singapore involuntarily simply because the flight that he is on makes a scheduled stop in Singapore either for refuelling or for picking up passengers or both. He books himself for that flight fully aware that it will enter the territory of Singapore. The meaning of the word “import” in s 5 of the Narcotic Control Act was also considered in R v Salvador, Wannamaker, Campbell and Nunes (1981) 59 CCC (2d) 521; the facts of that case highlight the width given to the natural and ordinary meaning of “import” by the Canadian courts. The accused persons in that case were the captain and members of the crew of a yacht which had sailed from Morocco with a cargo of 8,300lbs of cannabis resin, intending to import it into the United States. The yacht encountered bad weather and suffered damage to its rudder. At the material time, the yacht was just off the coast of Canada and the transcript of the radio transmissions between the yacht and the coastguard showed that the accused accepted the coastguard’s offer of a tow to safe harbour in Canadian waters. The evidence of the accused did not contradict the fact that they knew that the tow would bring them into Canadian waters. The cargo of cannabis was discovered when the yacht was in safe harbour and the accused were charged and convicted of importing the cannabis into Canada contrary to s 5 of the Narcotic Control Act. The accused appealed to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, contending that the trial judge had erred in his direction to the jury inasmuch as he did not direct them that the entry into Canada had to be voluntary. The court reviewed the authorities on the meaning of import and approved, inter alia, Geesman ([9] supra) and MacDonald JA, delivering the main judgment of the court, stated the following essential elements of the charge of importation under s 5 (at 540): It is helpful in the present discussion of the Convention to consider the decisions in other jurisdictions which are signatories to the Convention on the meaning of “import”. In R v Geesman ([9] supra), the accused was arrested at an airport in Canada following the discovery of hashish on him. He was charged with having imported a narcotic drug into Canada contrary to s 5 of the Narcotic Control Act 1961. His defence was that he had brought the hashish into Canada for the sole purpose of carrying it across the country in order to transport the substance across the border with the United States. Counsel for the accused contended that this intention was an intention merely to transit through Canada and not to import drugs into Canada, and that on a strict construction of s 5 of the Narcotic Control Act, the charge was not made out. That Act did not define “import”. O’Meara JSP rejected the argument and held that the word “import” had to be given its natural and ordinary meaning. The learned judge said (at 244):\n",

      " Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. We affirm the verdict and the mandatory sentence passed by the trial judges. Another point raised by Cheuk is that the trial judges should not have allowed a joint trial as it has in this case occasioned a miscarriage of justice. Section 176 of the Criminal Procedure Code permits a joint trial where more than one person is accused of the same offence or of different offences in the same transaction. Her counsel submitted that Tse and Cheuk were not charged for the same offence nor were the offences committed in the same transaction. He submitted that though the accused did not object to the joint trial it was no less a nullity. He said that the joint trial prejudiced Cheuk in two ways. First, the unfavourable view which the trial judges took of Tse’s case would have adversely affected hers. Second, since Tse chose to remain silent, Cheuk could not compel Tse to give evidence which would support her case. The only additional case which has been cited to us here and which was not cited to the court in Ng Kwok Chun ([1] supra) is the Australian case R v Bull (1974) 131 CLR 203. There, four men were charged with having committed certain offences against the Australian Customs Act 1901–1974. They were found guilty by the jury of, inter alia, importing into Australia a prohibited import, cannabis, contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Act. The master of the vessel was also convicted of knowingly allowing the vessel to be used in the importation of goods contrary to s 233A of the Act. All the acts and events relied upon by the Prosecution occurred at sea within three miles off the coast of the Northern Territory of Australia. While the vessel was within that limit, it was intercepted by a helicopter and a launch of the Australian authorities. The accused threw into the sea 31,000g of cannabis, which were being brought from Bali to Australia. Before pronouncing judgment, the trial judge stated a case for the consideration of the Australian High Court. Five questions were posed.

      " We would record our grave doubts over the correctness of the appellant’s actions in the days after the respondent’s acquittal below. However, in view of our decision to dismiss the appeal, and in the absence of full argument on the nature and extent of the court’s inherent jurisdiction over its criminal procedure, we would decline to express any definitive view on Mr Sant Singh’s contentions although we are of the preliminary view that such a power to stay criminal proceedings in circumstances where it can be shown that the accused could not have a fair trial exists. The learned DPP conceded in his reply that the appeal would fail if we found against him on the issue of joint custody or joint possession of the Gucci bag. However, in view of counsel’s arguments on the question of common intention, we will deal briefly with the views we formed on this element of the charge against the respondent. In R v Strong The Times (26 January 1989), the English Court of Appeal had to consider the question of what the Prosecution has to prove in order to make out the charge of joint possession of cannabis where the cannabis was found concealed in the car in which the accused were travelling. Lord Lane LCJ is reported as having said: The distinction is thus between inculpatory and exculpatory parts of a statement. We did not see how the statements as regards the plan to smuggle contraband could be taken as inculpatory with reference to a charge of attempting to export controlled drugs. If the truth of her statement that the contraband was Du Pont pens and lighters could not be accepted at this stage, then equally we could not accept that there was a plan to smuggle. On that basis, by the DPP’s own concession that the events in Singapore alone did not prove joint possession of the diamorphine, the Prosecution had not made out its case.\n",

      " Having perused the record of appeal, however, we feel it necessary at the same time to add our observations as regards the decision in the court below to disallow the admission of the appellant’s s 122(6) statement recorded by Senior Narcotics Officer Chew. Two reasons were given for this decision. Firstly, the fact that the appellant had not been given any food or drink after his arrest and up to the time the s 122(6) statement was being recorded (a period of about seven hours) was held to have “sapped” his free will. Secondly, there was apparently some confusion as to whether the appellant had been taken to hospital for his post-statement medical examination immediately after his statement was recorded (as the appellant claimed) or whether there had been a delay of about half an hour (as Chew claimed); and this confusion was held to have thrown the integrity of the recording process into question. Having regard to the reasons given above we dismissed the appeal. We were also of the view that in any case the learned judicial commissioner did not actually rely on the evidence of Koh’s pocket book entries in coming to his decision. Although he set out the contents of the pocket book entries in his judgment, this was done as part of the process of setting out the relevant background to the case. He referred to Koh’s evidence again when rejecting the appellant’s defence of duress but this reference was made after he had examined the evidence given by the appellant in court and found that on the basis of the appellant’s own evidence, the defence of duress was not made out. Indeed, the reference to Koh’s pocket book entries was somewhat perfunctory since by that stage it was eminently clear that, in dismissing the defence of duress, it would be unnecessary to rely on the evidence of the pocket book entries. We were of the view therefore that the admission of Koh’s pocket book entries as evidence did not occasion the appellant such prejudice as to deprive him of a fair trial. Since neither defence raised by the appellant was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case, the appellant was convicted of the charge against him.\n",

      " Having found the respondent’s acquittal to be against the weight of the evidence, we accordingly allowed the appeal, convicted the respondent and sentenced him to death. As was held by Spenser-Wilkinson J in Tara Singh v PP [1949] MLJ 88 at 89, the principle is that an impression as to the demeanour of the witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence. Thus in the present case, we were not satisfied from the reasons given in his findings that the trial judge had in the present case sufficiently considered all the evidence against the respondent, especially the contradictions and lies told by the respondent, when he came to a conclusion as to his veracity. In fact, as we have already observed, the respondent’s evidence at some points was quite incredible. We were firmly convinced that he was not a credible witness and had not succeeded in rebutting the presumption of knowledge, and the trial judge ought to have rejected his innocent bailee defence. A reading of the above section shows that the powers that this court can exercise on an appeal from an acquittal are not subject to any express limitation. As the appeal in the present case is primarily an appeal on fact, we turn to the Privy Council decision of Sheo Swarup v King-Emperor AIR 1934 PC 227 where the Board succinctly set out the principles that a High Court should consider when dealing with acquittals on a matter of fact from the sessions court. There, the relevant provision in the Indian Criminal Procedure Code under consideration was s 423 which is similar to our s 54 in that there was no limitation or restriction on the High Court in the exercise of its power as an appellate tribunal. We therefore consider the observations of the Board highly instructive. It was our view that at the close of the prosecution case, the prosecution evidence against the respondent was actually the strongest as compared to that against the other conspirators as quite apart from the other evidence adduced against him, the respondent had to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the drugs in his car boot on a balance of probabilities while the other three only had to raise a reasonable doubt.\n",

      " Kong, in his defence, did not give any explanation at all – not to mention any plausible explanation – that his involvement in the matter was purely coincidental and had nothing to do with the transportation of the drugs by Tan and Yeap. He met Warren Lee at Mandarin Hotel on the morning of 16 July 1989; he did not explain the purpose of such meeting and no evidence was given as to how long he had known Warren Lee. He went with Warren Lee to Plaza Hotel to meet Tan and Yeap, and there he alone went up to Room 634 and introduced himself to Tan and Yeap. His explanation was that Warren Lee asked him to do that but there was no explanation why he should or would do such a thing at the mere bidding of Warren Lee. On his evidence, he did not know Tan and Yeap and they were Warren Lee’s friends; yet at the mere request of Warren Lee, he would go to their room to meet them unaccompanied by Warren Lee. Later, he and Warren Lee boarded a taxi at Plaza Hotel and led Tan and Yeap in Yeap’s car to Mandarin Hotel and on arrival, both he and Warren Lee alighted at the entrance. He then went into Yeap’s car and led Tan and Yeap to the car park in Mandarin Hotel, collected the car key and then parted company with them. Again, no explanation was given for this somewhat devious exercise. What was the purpose of leading Tan and Yeap to Mandarin Hotel, showing them the car park and collecting the key to the car from them? Assuming that he did this at the request of Warren Lee, then the inevitable question was: What was his reason or explanation for doing all these at the request of Warren Lee? By taking over or collecting the key from Tan and Yeap, he took possession of the car. Under s 18(1) of the Act, he is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have possession of the drugs at the time, and under s 17 he is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking therein. In these circumstances, it is incumbent on him to show that he did not know that the drugs were in the fuel tank and that his involvement was purely coincidental. That he has not succeeded in doing. The evidence of Tan and Yeap therefore is not required to be corroborated and the court is not required to warn itself about convicting Kong on the uncorroborated evidence of Tan and Yeap. It has not been suggested that that part of the evidence of Tan and Yeap implicating Kong was self-serving and for the purpose of exonerating themselves at the expense of Kong or was given with any improper motive. At any rate, there was no evidence of this nature. We therefore reject the second main argument that the trial judge erred in relying on the evidence of Tan and Yeap in making his findings against Kong. We now turn to the first main argument. The first oral statement was said to have been made by Kong to SNO Peter Lim in his office in CNB with NO Ng acting as the Mandarin interpreter. Counsel submitted that evidence adduced to prove that the statement was made was wholly unsatisfactory and should not have been accepted by the trial judge. Firstly, NO Ng was the arresting officer and should not have acted as the interpreter and a wholly independent person against whom no allegation of bias could be made should have acted as the interpreter: R v Mitchell [1970] Crim LR 153 and Cheong See Leong v PP (1949) 15 MLJ 67; (1948–49) MLJ Supp 56. This argument has no merit. SNO Peter Lim was at that time investigating a serious offence and it was clearly in order for him to interview Kong with the help of NO Ng as the interpreter in Mandarin. There is no principle of law which requires that on such occasion an interpreter not involved in the investigation should be called upon to interpret. There is no allegation of bias against either SNO Peter Lim or NO Ng, and we cannot see any objection in NO Ng acting as the Mandarin interpreter for SNO Peter Lim in such an interview. The case of R v Mitchell is wholly irrelevant. There, at the trial, the judge allowed a waiter of the restaurant, the proprietor of which had complained against the accused, to act as the interpreter and it was held that such act amounted to an irregularity of such a character as to make it unsafe in the circumstances to let the conviction stand. In Cheong See Leong the accused was convicted of an offence under the emergency regulations. At the trial evidence was given of a statement of the accused alleged to have been made to the inspector through the interpretation of a detective sergeant who was a member of the investigation team. It was held that the use of the police sergeant as an interpreter who was fully conversant with the material facts and was subsequently called by the Prosecution offended against the elementary ideas of justice and therefore no reliance could be placed on the accuracy of the statement. This case was reported in a note form which is not at all adequate, and we are unable to ascertain precisely the reasoning for the decision. We are not persuaded that the principle laid down in Cheong See Leong is applicable on this occasion when SNO Peter Lim was interviewing or questioning Kong with the assistance of NO Ng acting as an interpreter. On these facts, which were not disputed, the following presumptions under the provisions of the Act arise. Firstly, as the drugs were found in the car which was owned by Yeap but which at the material time was driven by Tan, under s 21 the drugs are presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be in the possession of Yeap as the owner of the car and Tan as the person in charge of the car for the time being. Secondly, under s 17 they are presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have had the drugs in their possession for the purpose of trafficking and under s 18(2) of the Act, they are presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have known the nature of the drugs. They transported the drugs all the way from Haadyai to Singapore and in Singapore from Plaza Hotel to the car park in Mandarin Hotel. Proof of the act of transporting plus the presumption under s 17 would constitute a prima facie case of trafficking which, if unrebutted, would warrant their convictions: Wong Kee Chin v PP [1977–1978] SLR(R) 628 at [33]. The only question therefore is whether Tan and Yeap have rebutted this prima facie case on the balance of probabilities.\n",

      " Counsel for the appellant referred the court to Sarkar on Evidence (14th Ed, 1993) and submitted that the onus of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt was always on the Prosecution. Suspicion, it was argued, cannot take the place of legal proof. This argument was premised on a misunderstanding of s 18 of the Act. It is accepted that the onus is always on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt but, in the context of the Act, the law has provided the Prosecution with presumptions and the court must have regard to them. Once the presumptions were triggered in this case the onus was on the accused to discharge the presumptions. It would then be up to the court to decide whether or not to believe him; to assess his credibility and veracity; to observe his demeanour; to listen to what he had to say; to go through the evidence and determine whether his story was consistent; and finally to make a judicial decision. By his counsel’s own concession, the appellant’s conduct was suspect and indeed that he might have suspected that something was amiss. Given this scenario, the appellant’s task of rebutting the presumptions on a balance of probabilities must surely have been rendered extremely difficult from the outset. We are therefore of the view that it was impossible to fault the trial judge’s decision. Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal. By s 18 of the Act, rebuttable presumptions arose that the appellant had the drug in his possession and that he knew the nature of the drug he was carrying. Once the presumptions arose, the onus of discharging them was on the appellant. Having heard the appellant’s defence, the learned trial judge was satisfied that he had not discharged this onus. On reviewing the record we are of the view that the trial judge’s finding was clearly ineluctable. The appellant’s reason for adducing additional evidence at this stage of the proceedings was that these documents were retained by the prison authorities despite his instructions that they be handed to his lawyer. Without expressing any opinion as regards the first condition of “non-availability”, we are of the view that the second and third conditions of “relevance” and “reliability” have not been met. Counsel for the appellant conceded that the additional evidence sought to be admitted had no bearing on the question of guilt or innocence of the appellant. The additional evidence was instead adduced for the rather tenuous reason that, had they been available at the trial, the trial judge’s impression of the appellant would have been different. The test of relevance is more stringent than that. We reiterate that the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case. As for the condition of “reliability”, we note that one of the certificates of guarantee was actually made out to “Mrs E Van Damme” and more significantly, was dated “26 September 1991”. Nowhere in the appellant’s testimony regarding his movements on 26 September 1991 did he mention visiting the jewellers. As for the business cards, there was absolutely no evidence as to when they might have been procured by the appellant. Accordingly, we found that there was no merit in the application and we dismissed the motion. The appellant was charged under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) for importing two packets of substance containing not less than 4,320g of diamorphine into Singapore. The appellant’s defence at the trial was that he did not know that diamorphine was concealed in the suitcase. He claimed that he was an innocent custodian of the suitcase and that he was carrying the bag from Bangkok to Athens as a favour for one John U Obiefuna (“Obiefuna”) who said it contained children’s clothes and clothes for his wife. The learned trial judge rejected the appellant’s defence that he did not know that diamorphine was concealed in the suitcase. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant.

Firstly, he pointed to the unsatisfactory evidence as to the hotel register. The appellant said that he checked out of the Four Seas Hotel and not the Lion City Hotel, on the day in question. The Lion City Hotel did not have the appellant’s name, and the Four [South] Seas Hotel register had amendments, raising doubts as to the date on which he had checked out of that hotel. Secondly, counsel refers to the list of articles seized from the appellant by the CNB officers.

      " On appeal, the same arguments that were canvassed before the learned judge were canvassed before us. Just as the learned judge found no merit in them, we too did not find any merit in the appellant’s contentions and accordingly we dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence of death passed by the learned trial judge on the appellant. Firstly, the appellant said he signed his Republic of Niger passport in June 1993, but there were endorsements in the passport dated between January and March 1993, which were unexplained. If the passport had been obtained to allow the appellant to go to Thailand in June 1993, there was no reason for those endorsements. If the endorsements were genuine, then the passport must have been used before it was signed. Secondly, the learned judge could not understand why the appellant signed the passport with a name that was not his own which he claimed he used for signing invoices. If this was true, the learned judge also had difficulty understanding why the appellant would sign invoices with a name which was not his. No explanation for this conduct was given. Thirdly, the inconsistencies in the date of birth and height of the appellant in his two passports were not resolved. Fourthly, the learned trial judge concluded that the false endorsements in the appellant’s Nigerian passport must have been inserted to enable the appellant to travel without revealing that he had visited Thailand and to give the impression that he had left Hong Kong on 8 July 1993 rather than Bangkok. The appellant’s travelling with this passport in his possession contradicted the picture he sought to paint of being an innocent dupe. Fifthly, the conduct of the Udo brothers must have made the appellant suspect that the representations they had made to him were not true. Sixthly, the appellant failed to inform the narcotics officers at the airport, or to state in his cautioned statement, that the bags concerned did not belong to him. All he stated was that a man had given him the bags in Bangkok. In this regard, the learned judge did not accept that Insp Jeyaraje had refused to record all that the appellant had said. Finally, the learned judge was prepared to accept that the appellant did not notice the hidden packets of drugs concealed in the bags. The appellant was charged and convicted of importing into Singapore, on 8 July 1993, not less than 8,968g of diamorphine contrary to s 7 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). He was duly sentenced to death. We heard his appeal against conviction on 15 August 1994 and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.\n",

      " In the circumstances, there were more than substantial grounds to reject the appellant’s evidence as incredible. The learned trial judge had clearly and carefully considered the evidence before him in coming to his conclusion that the appellant was not an innocent carrier without knowledge of the drugs concealed in the bag. The appeal had no merit and accordingly, we dismissed it and confirmed the sentence of death passed by the learned trial judge on the appellant. In our judgment, the learned trial judge was fully justified in coming to that conclusion. The appellant’s evidence was clearly that Sunny knew her by her nickname “Noi” and that she had never told Sunny her full name. However, it was also her evidence that she did not know whether he knew it or not. This being so, we considered an aspect of her evidence which was clearly related. This was the question as to how Sunny’s friend was to contact the appellant in Singapore. The appellant admitted that she did not know how save for the fact that Sunny had told her that his friend would come and look for her at the hotel. She said that she would have given the bag to anyone who came to her and introduced himself as Sunny’s friend. In her evidence, the appellant had also admitted that Sunny did not provide her with any description of his “friend”. It was indeed illogical for the appellant to agree to deliver a bag to an unknown stranger in a foreign country when the intended recipient was unknown to her and the appellant herself did not know if Sunny’s friend knew her full name. It was therefore not unreasonable for the learned trial judge to have concluded that Sunny would not have known the full name of the appellant. On reviewing the evidence, the learned trial judge found several incredible aspects of the evidence of the appellant as to her purpose in coming to Singapore. The learned trial judge disbelieved the appellant’s evidence that she did not know that there were drugs hidden in the leather bag and concluded that the appellant had not, on a balance of probabilities, rebutted the operative presumptions. He was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly convicted her. The learned trial judge was not satisfied that the appellant had, at any time, denied knowledge of the drugs when they were discovered. He noted that the alleged conversation with the Director-General of Excise in Thailand was never properly proved. He held that even if the appellant had told him that she did not know that there was heroin in the bag, “having regard to the prosecution evidence, which I accepted, that she at all times remained silent, nothing turns on her denial”.\n",

      " Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence of death passed by the learned judge on the appellant. We were unable to see how much more random the sampling and analysis procedure could have been. As such, we were entirely satisfied that the scientific tests which were carried out on the nine 5g samples were representative of the entire plant material and it was unnecessary for Ms Granroth to carry out tests on at least 500g of the plant material. As the tests had shown that all nine samples belonged to the plant of the genus cannabis from which the resin had not been extracted, we had no doubt that the Prosecution had proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that the plant material seized from the appellant was not less than 1,026g of cannabis as defined by s 2 of the Act. Mr Almenoar took issue with the learned judge’s comments that to analyse the whole of the contents or a substantial part of it was “an absurd proposition” and “an impossible task no chemist should be required to do”. He referred us to the case of PP v Ang Soon Huat [1990] 2 SLR(R) 246, where Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) had held that, due to the unsatisfactory nature of the scientific analysis of the drugs, there had been a reasonable doubt as to the exact weight of diamorphine which the accused had been charged with trafficking. Mr Almenoar submitted that the Prosecution had failed to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the entire plant material was 1,026g of cannabis since Ms Granroth had only carried out tests on 45g out of the entire 1,026g of plant material.\n",

      " Accordingly we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the verdict and the sentence passed by the judicial commissioner. We were, therefore, of the view that the good character evidence of the appellant, even if accepted, would not affect her conviction as she had admitted that she knew she was carrying cannabis into Singapore. She had even suspected that the substance might have been heroin instead. We found therefore she had failed to rebut the presumptions stated in s 18 of the Act. Counsel for the appellant cited the case of R v Taaffe [1984] 1 All ER 747 for the contention that when the state of an accused person’s mind and his knowledge were ingredients of the offence he was charged with, he had to be judged on the facts as he believed them to be. In our opinion, R v Taaffe was inapplicable for two reasons. Firstly, Taaffe was caught importing a controlled drug. His defence was that he thought that he was smuggling currency and had mistakenly believed this to be an offence. Hence it was held by the House of Lords that even though he had committed the actus reus of importing a controlled drug, he did not have the mens rea of being “knowingly concerned” within s 170 of the English Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. The mere fact that he thought that smuggling currency was illegal (when it was actually legal) could not establish a guilty mind. In the present case, the appellant had admitted that she thought she was carrying cannabis. Unlike the smuggling of currency in Taaffe, which was not a crime in England, cannabis is a controlled drug under the Act, and importation of cannabis is itself a crime in Singapore. At the conclusion of the trial, the judicial commissioner found that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumptions under s 18 of the Act and was thus guilty as charged. The appellant was sentenced to death.\n",

      " Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the court below. As can be seen, s 122(5) of the CPC lays down only two conditions for the admissibility of any statement: that it be made to an officer of a specified rank, and that there be no threat, inducement or promise of the kind which the section makes provision for. Once those conditions are satisfied, the plain words of the section specify that the statement “shall be admissible at his trial in evidence”. Even more to the point, immediately after these words, the section then makes provision for the special case where the accused does in fact testify in his own defence: “if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit”. The clear implication, therefore, is that the statement is admissible as evidence whether the accused gives evidence or not. For these reasons, it is our view that s 122(5) of the CPC allows the Prosecution to use the statement as part of the prosecution case. If the accused does testify, then the Prosecution can go on to cross-examine him on the statement or impeach his credit. The purpose of the s 122(6) warning, then, is merely to warn the accused of the power given to the court by virtue of s 123(1) of the CPC to “draw such inferences ... as appear proper” from an accused person’s refusal to explain any fact which he may reasonably be expected to explain. We were, therefore, of the view that the trial judge erred in not admitting in evidence the appellant’s s 122(6) statement before the defence was called. A s 122(6) statement can and should be admitted as part of the Prosecution’s case. Counsel for the appellant emphasised repeatedly that the third sentence of the s 122(6) statement was “I now know it is a drug”, not “I know it is a drug” and was, therefore, indicative of the absence of knowledge on the part of the appellant. He also stressed most strenuously that the interpreter Wu Nan Yong agreed with him. Wu Nan Yong did, in fact, agree with him that the Cantonese word for “now” had been used by the appellant. However, counsel did not manage to establish that Wu thought the word “now” indicated recent knowledge. Wu appeared to use it to mean the present tense. On re-examination, he stated, “I did not use the word ‘now’ but I used another word ... I used a present tense to indicate that he has knowledge at that time” [emphasis added]. When the deputy public prosecutor repeated the italicised sentence to him he confirmed it. In our view, if the appellant had indeed wished to communicate the idea that he only came to the realisation that the vest contained heroin after his arrest and not at any time before, he could well have stated thus in less subtle language. In our view, this inference was eminently sensible, especially in light of the fact that the appellant did make a cautioned statement. He could easily have given all the facts rather than three brief sentences. In addition, we found the trial judge’s rejection of the appellant’s version of events sound. The appellant’s story was far-fetched, to say the least. There was no reason for Law, if indeed it were Law who instructed the appellant, to have placed another man on the flight just to hand over the vest to the appellant on the plane’s touch-down in Singapore. The appellant’s story as to the unknown Chinese man who handed him the vest was vague and not supported even by a description of the man. In our view, the appellant clearly imported the diamorphine himself.\n",

      " The second ground of appeal is that the trial court admitted and considered evidence which was not relevant to the charge. We do not think there is really any merit in this point. Sections 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act allow such evidence to be admitted. See also John Makin and Sarah Makin v The Attorney-General for New South Wales [1894] AC 57. The learned judicial commissioner was fully conscious of the issue. At two places the judicial commissioner specifically addressed this aspect of the matter. The judicial commissioner did not think that the omission of the words “or presumed” in the later version of the section was significant. He felt that the words “any person who is proved to have had in his possession” in the section did not preclude the Prosecution from relying on the presumption in s 17 even in a case where possession of the drug itself was presumed under s 18. This was how he reasoned ([21] supra): It is now well-established law that, at the close of the prosecution case, it is necessary that there be some evidence, not inherently incredible, which, if it were accepted to be accurate, could establish each essential element of the charge, before the defence may be called: Haw Tua Tau v PP [1981–1982] SLR(R) 133. Counsel for the accused attacked the findings and decision of the trial judge on a number of fronts. Broadly, they may be reduced into three main issues. First, whether the Prosecution had established a prima facie case to warrant calling upon the accused to make his defence. This in turn raises the question whether there was some evidence to prove the elements of “possession”, “knowledge” and “trafficking”. Second, whether the trial judge was wrong to have admitted certain prejudicial evidence which did not have anything to do with the charge. Third, whether the trial judge was wrong to have held that the accused had not shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the drugs were meant to be for his own consumption.\n",

      " That precisely was what had happened in the instant case. In the oral judgment the trial judge stated the charge, the prosecution case, the defence and his findings that the Prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, that he had no doubt that the appellant knew that diamorphine was concealed in the rice cookers, and that, accordingly, the appellant was guilty of the charge. Following what we have said in Goh Lai Wak ([19] supra), we could see no objection to the trial judge in this case providing, subsequent to his oral judgment, his written grounds of decision. In our judgment, these grounds of decision could certainly form part of the record for consideration by this court. Before us, counsel for the appellant raised three main arguments. First, as a preliminary point, he argued that the trial judge had already delivered an oral judgment on 20 September 1993 and erred in law in writing his grounds of decision on 20 December 1993. He submitted that the grounds of decision therefore ought to be disregarded and the court ought to have regard only to the reasons given in the oral judgment. Counsel relied on Ankur Nath Ganguli v PP [1956] MLJ 206, Lorraine Phylis Cohen v PP [1989] 2 MLJ 288 and s 46(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322). Similar argument as this has been canvassed before us very recently in Goh Lai Wak v PP [1994] 1 SLR(R) 563, and, in disposing of such argument, this court said at [34]: The appellant’s passport revealed that he was a Nigerian civil servant. HCO Michael sought confirmation from the appellant in English as to his profession and he replied “civil servant” in English. The appellant was then brought into the customs office where his luggage was searched. HCO Michael asked him if he had anything to declare and the appellant answered in the negative. Upon further questioning, the appellant stated that he came from Bangkok and would be staying two to three days in Singapore after which he would return to Bangkok for a month. He explained that the reason why he carried so much luggage for a short trip was because he intended to send them by special delivery. He replied that he did not have any cigarettes, liquors or drugs. HCO Michael then opened the appellant’s luggage. The black briefcase revealed clothings, coins, a Bible and a Book of Psalms. The grey plastic bag was then searched but only stainless steel items were found. After that, HCO Michael turned his attention to the colourful bag with the verticle stripes. In it were the following: a Kando light weight iron, a National electric pot and frying pan, a Sharp rice cooker and a Zojirushi rice cooker. He then examined the base of the Zojirushi rice cooker and noticed that one of the screws had been tampered with. CCO Tanahgobar was informed of this discovery. HCO Michael took a screwdriver from CCO Tanahgobar and was about to unscrew the base of the rice cooker when the appellant said that he felt like vomiting and tried to leave the room. He was stopped by CCO Tanahgobar from doing so. The appellant was given a plastic bag by CCO Tanahgobar to vomit into but the appellant only spat into it. HCO Michael asked the appellant if the rice cooker was new. The appellant answered in the affirmative and added that he had purchased it in Thailand. When the base of the rice cooker was removed, there was some asbestos lining, and when the lining was removed, there was a blue plastic bag containing a white powdery substance. HCO Michael pointed to the plastic bag and asked him twice what it was. The appellant remained silent. CCO Tanahgobar then checked the Sharp rice cooker and also noticed that the screws at the base had been tampered with. When the base was removed, a white plastic bag containing a white powdery substance was retrieved. When he was asked what it was, the appellant initially remained silent but then uttered “Hallelujah!” twice as well as words which nobody understood. He then said twice: “You can kill me!” The appellant, a Nigerian national, was tried before the High Court on a charge for importing into Singapore six packets of substance containing not less than 2,199g of diamorphine on 29 November 1990 at about 8.00am at Keppel Railway Station, contrary to s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). He was convicted and was sentenced to suffer death. Against his conviction this appeal was brought. We heard the appeal and, at the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed it. We now give our reasons.\n",

      " For the reasons given above, we also dismissed the second appellant’s appeal. Having regard to all the foregoing, we were of the considered view that there was no merit whatsoever in the first appellant’s appeal and we therefore dismissed it. In effect, therefore, neither Lee Mau Seng ([47] supra) nor the Malaysian cases constituted support for counsel’s submission that the first appellant suffered an injustice in not being granted immediate access to a lawyer following his arrest. There is a world of difference between “within a reasonable time” and “immediately”; and, in our view, two weeks in the present case was a reasonable period of time. In any case, as pointed out by the deputy public prosecutor, the recording of a statement under s 122(6) of the CPC does not compel an accused person to make any statement which incriminates him. The notice given under s 122(6) states only that he has to state any fact which he intends to rely on in his defence in court, and informs him of the consequences of any omission to do so. Wee Chong Jin CJ, in giving the above judgment, did not elaborate on what he considered a “reasonable time” to be. However, since the only exception he allowed was that categorically enacted by statute, it may be surmised that he intended the element of allowance for police investigations and procedure to be already built into the “reasonable time” time-frame. In short, the Lee Mau Seng criterion really led to the same practical result as that set by the Malaysian courts in the above-mentioned cases. In fact, this court preferred the Lee Mau Seng criterion since, with all due respect, it seemed to us somewhat elliptical to say on the one hand that an arrested person had a right to see counsel immediately but to stipulate on the other hand that the police could deny him that right if they needed time to complete investigations.\n",

      " Before concluding our judgment, we wish to note the dilemma the Public Prosecutor was in this case as, without any doubt, there was imported into Singapore, by one or more of these five persons, a quantity of cannabis of an amount which would have resulted in the death sentence being passed on those found guilty. The dilemma he was in was whether to charge all five of them with the importation of the cannabis, in which case he may have lacked the evidence to secure a conviction against any one or more of them. He chose to charge Sugianto and Abdullah against whom it appeared that he had the best evidence. After a careful scrutiny of the evidence as it unfolded at the trial, we have concurred with the learned judicial commissioner that the charges of importing and abetment were not proved against them respectively. The real culprit or culprits have gotten away with it. We can only hope that the Public Prosecutor will be untiring in his efforts to bring the real culprit or culprits, if there was more than one, to answer to the law. Accordingly, the Public Prosecutor’s appeal against the acquittal of Abdullah of conspiring with Sugianto to import the cannabis into Singapore is also dismissed. We can conceive of no alternative charge against Abdullah on the evidence before the High Court. In our judgment, it logically follows from the acquittal of Sugianto of the charge of importing the cannabis into Singapore concealed in the bed quilt packed in P31 that the charge against Abdullah of having conspired with Sugianto to import the cannabis into Singapore concealed in the bed quilt packed in P31 must also fail. The whole of the Prosecution’s case was premised on the fact that P31 belonged to Abdullah; that Sugianto took possession of P31 off the conveyor belt at the arrival hall at Terminal Two, Changi Airport and carried it on the trolley he was pushing; that in his s 122(6) statement Sugianto said that the cannabis belonged to Abdullah; that Abdullah paid Sugianto’s expenses for the visit to Bangkok; that Sugianto stayed in the same room with Abdullah at the Alpine Inn in Bangkok; that Sugianto was told that Abdullah might be bringing back “ganja”; to state some of the allegations presented by the Prosecution and which they sought to prove. Except for Sugianto’s s 122(6) statement, all of the above emanated from the evidence of Najeeb, Edros and Darus. We have pointed out that the learned judicial commissioner took a poor view of the credibility of these three witnesses and, for that reason, not all of the above allegations can be said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Most important of all, we have noted from the evidence that a very serious doubt has been cast on Abdullah’s ownership of P31. We concur with the learned judicial commissioner, therefore, that no great reliance can be placed on the above.\n",

      " For the reasons given above, we were of the view that there were no merits whatsoever in the appeals and we therefore dismissed them. Counsel for the first appellant raised substantially only two grounds of appeal. Firstly, that the trial judge had not given proper consideration to the first appellant’s defence that he was merely an innocent carrier and a “fall guy” for the conspiracy between the second appellant and Ram Babu to traffic in drugs. Secondly, that the trial judge erred in finding a common intention between the appellants to traffic in the drugs. We were of the opinion that the first ground of appeal was without merit. The trial judge rightly and properly rejected this defence. He found as a fact that the first appellant played an important role in the sale of the drugs to the extent that he determined the price and went to India to bring in the drugs. The trial judge disbelieved the first appellant’s evidence that he did not know English. There is absolutely no reason to disagree with the trial judge’s findings of fact on these matters, especially since he had the advantage of being able to observe the witnesses and to assess their credibility. We also reject counsel’s contention that the trial judge put words into Michael’s mouth that on the question of price of the drugs the second appellant conferred with the first appellant. The evidence was that when the issue of price came up in the negotiations between Michael and the second appellant, the latter would quote a price only after conferring with the first appellant in “an Indian language” which Michael admittedly did not understand. The evidence is therefore really irresistible that the first appellant played a role in the sale of the drugs to the extent that the second appellant had to confer with him before any price could be quoted. The trial judge found that the second appellant was not a truthful witness. Accepting Michael’s evidence as the truth of what took place at the two meetings in Mandarin Hotel, the trial judge found that it was the second appellant who principally negotiated with him in the sale of the drugs. His use of the words “thing” or “the things” served only to hide the truth which was that the meetings were with Michael and to sell drugs to him. The trial judge also found that the second appellant knew that the first appellant had with him ten cans of opium and two cans of diamorphine on 16 June 1990. The second appellant had consented to the first appellant carrying the drugs for delivery to Michael pursuant to the agreement to sell the drugs to Michael. The judge therefore held that the appellants had joint possession of the cans of opium and diamorphine. He was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants had together trafficked in drugs. At trial the Prosecution relied on ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”) which provide for the presumption of possession of the drugs in question and the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs. Reliance was also placed on s 18(4) which states that where one of two or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them. At the close of the prosecution case, the trial judge found that a prima facie case had been made out against both appellants with regard to the two amended charges and called upon their defence.\n",

      " Counsel for the second appellant took issue with the trial judge’s judgment on three grounds. First, he argued that the trial judge should have found that the Prosecution had not made out a prima facie case against the two accused. Second, he asserted that the trial judge had erred in failing to address the burden of proof upon the Prosecution of the second appellant’s guilt, ie proof beyond reasonable doubt. Third, he contended that the trial judge had erred in rejecting the second appellant’s defence. In his grounds of decision, the trial judge held that as the appellants had travelled by flight SQ57 from Hong Kong to Singapore and had the drugs strapped on them from Hong Kong until the time of their arrest, the actus reus of importing the heroin into Singapore had been established beyond reasonable doubt. He rejected the defence of the appellants that they did not know that they were carrying the prohibited drugs and that they did not know the destination of their flight from Hong Kong to Singapore until shortly before the plane landed. As regards the first appellant, the trial judge rejected the explanation that Ah Keung had asked him (the first appellant) to carry what purported to be tranquillizers in order to evade taxes. The trial judge did not believe that the first appellant did not know he was carrying heroin, given the manner in which the drugs were to be smuggled as well as the reward offered by Ah Keung. Furthermore, there was also no mention of the defence of tranquillizers in his cautioned statement. On the question of whether the first appellant knew he was coming into Singapore, the trial judge rejected his evidence that he only knew of this fact when the plane was just about to land. At the close of the prosecution case, the trial judge rejected the submissions of counsel for both the appellants that the appellants had no case to answer. He held that, on the evidence adduced by the Prosecution, a prima facie case had been made out against both appellants on their respective charges. The two appellants, both Hong Kong nationals, were jointly tried on separate charges of importing not less than 1,674.3g and 1,466.5g of diamorphine respectively into Singapore under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”). They were convicted and were sentenced to suffer death. Against their convictions they appealed. We dismissed the appeals and now give our reasons.\n",

      " Accordingly, we allow the appeal of the third appellant, set aside the conviction and acquit and discharge her. In our judgment, the evidence adduced as against the third appellant was much too scanty to warrant a finding that the third appellant abetted the first and second appellants in the commission of the offence by conspiring with them. In our judgment, there was no sufficient evidence for the court to infer any conspiracy between the third appellant and the first and second appellants in the sale and delivery of the drugs to Tan on 10 January 1993. The charge against her has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Here again, the trial judge has not erred in reaching this finding. The second appellant’s appeal therefore must fail and is dismissed. Even if such evidence is entirely excluded, there was ample evidence adduced before the trial judge which fully justified the conviction of the first appellant. Disregarding entirely the evidence of the earlier events and concentrating only on the events from 7 to 10 January 1993, we find that there was the following material evidence against the first appellant. First, there was the evidence of Tan on (a) his negotiations with the first appellant on 7, 8 and 9 January 1993; (b) the actions of the first appellant on the evening of 10 January 1993; and (c) the delivery of the bag that contained the cannabis. Next, there was the evidence that the $500 marked note given to him by Tan in part payment for the drugs was seized from him after his arrest. Thirdly, there was the cautioned statement recorded from him by the investigating officer in which he admitted to the charge. Lastly, although he did not carry the black bag that contained the cannabis, he was with the second appellant who carried the bag at the material time, and together they went and met Tan, and at Tan’s instruction, the bag was placed in the boot of Tan’s car. On the evidence adduced, he clearly knew that the bag contained cannabis, and under s 18(4) of the Act he was deemed to be in possession of the drugs found in the bag. Confronted with all this evidence, he had elected to remain silent; nor did he call any evidence in his defence. In our judgment, the charge against the first appellant has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. His appeal is plainly unsustainable and is dismissed.\n",

      " For all the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal. This argument had no merit, and we rejected it. The trial judge had carefully weighed the evidence in respect of each of the objections raised and found the objections to be without merit. We were not able to find any basis to say that the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence was faulty or that he erred in refusing to allow any of these objections. The trial judge was fully entitled on the evidence to accept the evidence of the investigating officer and the interpreter that they had taken time to go through the full process of reading, explaining and interpreting the charge to the appellant, that in explaining the charge to the appellant, they had interpreted the word “import” as “bringing heroin into Singapore” without any reference to the word “traffic”, and that the evidence did not support the appellant’s contention that her s 122(6) statement did not fully record all that she had said to the police. In any event, even if this statement was excluded, on basis of the evidence before the trial judge and his evaluation therefore, the appellant had not rebutted the presumptions under ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the Act. As for the second objection, the trial judge found that the interpreter had clearly testified that he had interpreted the word “import” as “bringing heroin into Singapore”, without any reference to the word “traffic” and held that he was satisfied that the charge was properly interpreted to the appellant and what was interpreted was sufficient to enable her to understand the charge that she faced before she gave her statement. None of these objections were sustained before the trial judge. In so far as the first objection was concerned, the trial judge held that he was satisfied on the evidence that sufficient time had been given to the appellant to enable her to comprehend fully the charge that she faced. He said that counsel’s argument was clearly at variance with the uncontroverted evidence of the investigating officer and the interpreter that they had taken time to go through the full process of reading, explaining and interpreting the charge and its nature and consequence to the appellant.\n",

      " Taken together with the statements which we decided were correctly admitted as well as the testimonies of the officers who were present at the material time, we were satisfied that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in drugs and had failed to rebut the operative presumptions contained in s 18 of the MDA. We found that the grounds of the appeal raised were without merit and accordingly we dismissed the appeal. Following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311, it is settled law that the burden rests on the appellant to prove on the balance of probabilities that he was not in possession and did not know the nature of the controlled drug which was contained in the bag. For the following reasons below, we were not convinced that the appellant had discharged his burden on the balance of probabilities. As regards the allegation of “you had better tell the truth”, it has been held in Lim Kim Tjok v PP [1977–1978] SLR(R) 403 that those words or equivalent expressions have always been held to import a threat or inducement. However, in a recent pronouncement of Chao Hick Tin JC, as he then was, in PP v Ramasamy a/l Sebastian [1990] 2 SLR(R) 197, the facts of each case have to be looked at individually. This was the position adopted by the House of Lords in DPP v Ping Lin [1975] 3 All ER 175 where Lord Hailsham stated that the question should be approached in a common sense way and in the context of the individual case. To this extent, we agree with the pronouncements of Chao JC and Lord Hailsham and find that, even if the allegation in the present case was true, we do not see how the expression could amount to a threat or inducement in the circumstances. Although those words were coupled with further statements to the effect that the appellant would be beaten up and sent to the gallows and verbal abuses which supposedly caused the appellant to shed tears, we are of the view that it was not sufficient to give the appellant any reasonable grounds for supposing that he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature by giving the statements. In any event, we would not disturb the trial judge’s finding that the appellant was lying and that there were no such threats or inducements as he had the opportunity to assess the demeanour of the appellant. We were not persuaded that the trial judge had made a wrong assessment of the evidence before him. In relation to both statements, the main complaint was that they were not given voluntarily but on account of an inducement or promise held out by both IO Cheong and Abdul Razak.

      " In conclusion, in our judgment, at the close of the Prosecution’s case, there is some evidence, not inherently incredible, which, if unaccepted, would establish all the essential elements of the charge against the respondent. His defence therefore ought to have been called. We have so ordered. Next, we turn to the s 121 statement made by the first accused, the material part of which has been set out above, and it is not necessary to repeat it. Briefly, it said that the third accused brought the respondent to the flat and through the third accused’s introduction the respondent sold a quantity of drugs to the first accused, for which the first accused paid the respondent the sum of $3,600. This statement is clearly a confession; and the trial judge has so found. Here again, this part of the statement is not inherently incredible in the circumstances. Thus, there is some evidence that the first and third accused, at the material time, had possession of the drugs with the knowledge and consent of the respondent. By selling and delivering the drugs to the first accused on the introduction and in the presence of the third accused the respondent had knowledge of and consented to the first and third accused having possession of the drugs. Hence, on the basis of this statement and the other evidence adduced, the essential elements of the charge have been established against the respondent. The test was approved of by this court in Chin Seow Noi v PP ([19] supra). In our opinion, having regard to the terms of the charge and reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made, the statement is a confession. The inference suggested by the statement was that the first accused was in possession of drugs. The content of this statement is not inherently incredible in the circumstances. That being so, there is evidence that the respondent took the drugs to the flat for packing and that the drugs were in the possession of the first and third accused at the time of their arrest. Thus, the first and third accused had possession of the drugs with the knowledge and consent of the respondent, and consequently under s 18(4) the respondent is deemed to be in possession of the drugs. Following from this, under s 17 all three of them are presumed to have the drugs in their possession for the purpose of trafficking. Whether a sale was contemplated or not at the same time is besides the point. This statement, if accepted, together with the other evidence adduced by the Prosecution establishes the essential elements of the charge against the respondent. Before we proceed further, it is necessary to focus on the charge that has been brought against the three accused. The charge in substance is that they, in furtherance of a common intention, had in their possession the quantity of diamorphine in question for the purpose of trafficking and by virtue of ss 5(2) and 17 of the Act trafficked in that quantity of diamorphine. In preferring this charge, the Prosecution has invoked s 34 of the Penal Code and ss 5(2) and 17 of the Act. All these provisions are well known and it is unnecessary to set them out verbatim. Suffice it here to say that the Prosecution relies on s 34 of the Penal Code to establish the liability of all the accused for the criminal act alleged to have been committed by one or more of them in furtherance of their common intention. The criminal act was the trafficking in the quantity of drugs. In proving trafficking in this case the Prosecution needs only to show that the accused had possession of that quantity of drugs at the material time. Once possession is proved, s 17 of the Act comes into operation and the accused are presumed to have the drugs in their possession for the purpose of trafficking, and unless this presumption is rebutted, under s 5(2) of the Act they committed the offence of trafficking. On the question of possession, the Prosecution relies on s 18(4) of the Act which provides:\n",

      " In summary, we are of the view that the trial judge correctly concluded that all the accused persons were guilty of the offences as charged owing to the overwhelming evidence against them as well as their inability to rebut the presumptions under the Act on the balance of probabilities. We are of the view that he had given due consideration to all the evidence before arriving at his findings. We see no reason to disagree with his decisions and accordingly we dismiss all the appeals. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from all the circumstances was that Yakoob knew of Lee’s drug trafficking activities. It was telling that Yakoob never enquired about the quantity of drugs to be deposited with him. He also claimed to find it strange that Lee himself did not hand him the drugs but that Choo was the one delivering it. Yet he insisted thrice that he could not simply refuse to take the bag and turn Choo away since the bag did not belong to Choo. This was allegedly only because Yakoob mentioned Choo’s name. Even though he felt frightened that the bag was so heavy, his first reaction was not to try to return the drugs to Choo or to keep the drugs in his locker. Instead, he walked into the “ZONE” shop to ponder over whether to keep or return the bag. Yakoob also chose to remain silent when called to give a cautioned statement, declaring that he had nothing to say. He claimed to have been confused and frightened. It did not occur to him to exculpate himself in any way and he also did not want to implicate Lee. Yakoob’s silence in the face of the weighty evidence against him permitted an adverse inference to be drawn, in the light of all the circumstances. Crucial aspects of his evidence were less than convincing and certainly fell short of discharging his burden of rebutting the presumption of trafficking. Accordingly, we dismiss his appeal. We shall deal first with the cases cited by counsel. It should be noted that the amendments to the Act in December 1993 have changed the complexion of s 17 and also introduced s 5(2). Thus, we do not see how the statements of the Privy Council in Ong Ah Chuan ([58] supra) could have any relevance in the current statutory climate. The definition of “traffic” in s 2 of the Act has not been amended. The Act itself makes no reference to “end-users” or promotion or distribution of drugs, apart from the fact that “distribute” comes within one of the seven definitions of “traffic” in s 2. There is no requirement that the person found in possession must be shown to be a “dealer” or “supplier” in order for the presumption of trafficking in s 17 to operate. There is also no requirement in the Act for any directly proximate connection between any particular end-user and an accused who is found in possession of a quantity of drugs which attracts the presumption of trafficking in s 17. R v Carey ([58] supra) appears to be factually analogous to the present case. The court’s reasoning may, however, be easily distinguished on the point that s 25(1) of the New South Wales Act makes the supply of prohibited drugs an offence. The relevant offence of “supplying” drugs, as defined in the Australian legislation, may carry the necessary connotation that there must be some element of provision, distribution or promotion of drugs. The same cannot be said of the local offence-creating provisions and the definition of “traffic” in s 2 of the Act, which are worded in quite dissimilar terms. As for Wan Yue Kong’s case ([59] supra), it must be emphasised that this case was decided within the framework of the existing law prior to the 1993 amendments. Counsel did not advert to the important fact that, in that case, the court expressly found that the Prosecution had not adduced any evidence to show that the first and second respondents were involved in any overt acts of trafficking. They were merely found in possession of the drugs and hence could only have been convicted of the offence of possession. In the present statutory regime, however, s 17 as it now stands would give rise to the presumption that the first and second respondents had the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, and unless they succeeded in rebutting the presumption, they would have committed the offence of trafficking in the drugs. Delivering the judgment of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, Hunt J was of the view that the above definition of “supply” did not include the mere transfer of physical control (ie return) of drugs to their owner or to the person reasonably believed to be the owner. As such, the defence of the accused was accepted and her conviction was quashed. Counsel also referred the court to PP v Wan Yue Kong [1995] 1 SLR(R) 83 in support of his contention that keeping drugs for the purpose of returning them to their owner would not constitute the offence of trafficking. In Wan Yue Kong, the first and second respondents were convicted on the lesser offence of possession of controlled drugs. They knew of the presence of drugs in the flat but the drugs were left there by one Loo Koon Seng (“Loo”) who was their rightful owner and who had intended to retrieve them from the premises. Based on his primary submission that “trafficking” must connote promotion or distribution of drugs, counsel contended that mere bailees like Yakoob were not truly intended to be captured by the scope of the wide-ranging presumptions in the Act. He cited the example of an unsuspecting cloakroom attendant who is handed a coat which he knows to contain drugs and later returns it to its owner with the drugs intact. He argued that the attendant is not trafficking drugs in the sense that he has not actively promoted the distribution of the drugs. He has merely returned them to the owner and is therefore not a trafficker in what counsel submits is the “true” sense of the word.\n",

      " In coming to my conclusion, I appreciated the fact that the respondent had been a very consistent witness. His long statement made shortly after his arrest and his evidence in court were substantially similar. Moreover, the independent evidence obtained by counsel for the respondent supported many aspects of his evidence. Nevertheless, I was of the opinion that the corroboration of his evidence and his consistency must be viewed with caution. The matters so substantiated, including the existence of Maung Maung, the Haroon Mosque, the McDonald’s Restaurant, the existence of Yusoof, the flight to Hatyai, the stay in Haadyai International Hotel and finally the flight to Singapore were features common to the operation of any smuggling outfit, whether of drugs or of gems. They were relevant to show that the respondent was a courier, which was in any event undisputed. However, these aspects were immaterial to the question of the respondent’s knowledge of what he was smuggling. As such, his truthfulness in these matters should not, in my view, be accorded undue weight when dealing with the question of knowledge. Accordingly, I would have allowed the appeal and convicted the respondent. The respondent, Hla Win, was acquitted of the charge of importing into Singapore 3,468g of diamorphine. His acquittal was appealed against by the Prosecution. At the conclusion of the hearing, I found the appeal to be of merit and was unable to agree with the majority decision to dismiss the appeal. The following are my reasons. It was not in dispute that the respondent was in possession of the bag and the bag contained the drugs, the subject matter of the charge. Accordingly, by virtue of ss 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the Act, the respondent was presumed to have the drugs in his possession and further, to know the nature of the drugs. The burden therefore shifted to the respondent to rebut the presumptions on a balance of probabilities. On this burden of proof, the learned trial judge had this to say ([1995] SGHC 65 at [64]): The respondent was acquitted of the charge of importing into Singapore not less than 3,468g of diamorphine, an offence under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”). Against his acquittal the Prosecution appealed. By a majority, with the Chief Justice dissenting, we dismissed the appeal. We now give our reasons\n",

      " There was, therefore, ample evidence against both the appellants. They had abetted Tan by conspiracy to export a large quantity of heroin to Spain, in consequence of which Tan attempted to do so but was arrested at the airport. Both the appeals were without merit and were dismissed. This submission raised two points for consideration. The first was whether the learned trial judge was right in postponing his determination of the admissibility of Goh’s statements until he had concluded the hearing of Ko’s voir dire. We think that generally it is desirable that a trial judge, having conducted a voir dire to determine the admissibility of a statement made by an accused, should at the conclusion of the voir dire make a ruling on the admissibility of that statement. That obviously is the most convenient stage to make the ruling. However, this is not an immutable rule. It is essentially a matter of procedure which is best left to the trial judge to decide. If a trial judge, in conducting more than one voir dire to determine the admissibility of statements of two or more accused, finds that it is more convenient to make the determination at the conclusion of all the voir dires, there could not be any objection to such a procedure. It is not vitally important at which stage he should make the determination. What is vitally important is that if the trial judge at the time when he makes the determination harbours any doubt whether the statement has been caused by any inducement, threat or promise, then he must exclude it, as in such a case the Prosecution has not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the statement has been voluntarily made. Hence, we do not see anything seriously wrong in the learned trial judge postponing his decision on the admissibility of Goh’s statements until the conclusion of Ko’s voir dire, although, quite candidly, we cannot see any reason why he could not have done so, and indeed should not have done so, at the conclusion of Goh’s voir dire. He found that the Prosecution had proved its case against all the three accused beyond any reasonable doubt and he convicted each of them on the charge they each faced. The appellants and one Tan Seng Kim (“Tan”) were jointly tried before the High Court on charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”). Tan was charged for attempting to export to Spain 226 rubber pellets containing not less than 871.77g of diamorphine and the appellants were both charged for abetting Tan in the commission of that offence. All of them were convicted. Only the appellants appealed against their convictions. We dismissed their appeals and now give our reasons.\n",

      " The next question is whether the presumption under s 17 arises, since possession of the drugs by Tan is established only by virtue of s 18(4). It has been decided in Low Kok Wai v PP [1994] 1 SLR(R) 64 that the presumption under s 17 would only arise if possession of the drugs has been proved, and it may be said that possession under s 18(4) is not possession that has been proved. In our opinion, the answer to this is twofold. Firstly, it has been proved that Tan had brought the drugs to the flat and sold them to Foong pursuant to an arrangement made by or through Lim. There is no question that Tan knew that what he had sold to Foong were drugs. His knowledge and handling of the drugs had been proved. It is true that at common law as he had sold and delivered the drugs to Foong, he no longer had possession of the drugs. But by virtue of s 18(4) and on the facts of the case he was deemed to be in possession of the drugs: he had knowledge of and consented to Foong and also Lim having possession of the drugs. In that sense, possession has been proved. Secondly, even without the presumption under s 17, there was sufficient evidence to show that the drugs were in the possession of all three of them for the purpose of trafficking. After the sale and delivery, ten sachets of drugs were packed from the quantity sold by Tan, and Foong went out to deliver them to George. There were 31 similar sachets also packed by Foong or Lim or both of them from the same source. The inference is that these were intended for trafficking. Tan was present throughout and could hardly say that he did not know the intended purpose of the drugs. It is true that as Foong was the only one who had bought the drugs and therefore he was the only one who was capable of trafficking in the drugs. Neither Tan nor Lim could do so, as the drugs did not belong to them. That however is immaterial. All three of them had possession of the drugs and the intended purpose of the drugs was for trafficking. It does not matter if only one of them would or could traffic in those drugs. Section 34 is an enabling provision, and it was invoked to render all three of them liable for the criminal act committed by one or more of them. If, however, the criminal act was committed by all of them then it is unnecessary to invoke s 34. In this case, even without invoking s 34, the Prosecution has proved the charge against all the three appellants, ie that they trafficked in the quantity of drugs in question. The basis for this is s 18(4) which states: Reverting to the facts, counsel submitted that clearly there was an absence of any pre-arranged plan which was a requisite in establishing the presence of a common intention. Further, assuming that all three of them had joint possession of the drugs, such joint possession does not amount to common intention to traffic in the drugs in question. Accordingly, there was no criminal act committed in furtherance of a common intention and the charge founded on s 34 was erroneous and all the three appellants had been wrongly convicted on the present charge. We turn finally to the issue of common intention. It was contended on behalf of all the appellants that there was not in existence the common intention entertained by all the three of them, in furtherance of which the offence they were jointly charged was committed, and accordingly an essential ingredient of the charge has not been proved. This argument was advanced principally by counsel for Foong, with whom the counsel for the other appellants associated themselves. His submission was briefly this. Assuming that the evidence adduced by the Prosecution was accepted, each of the three appellants had different intention at all material times. Before the drugs were brought to the flat, the intention of Foong was to buy the drugs, that of Tan was to sell them and that of Lim was to introduce and procure Tan to come to the flat and sell the drugs to Foong. After the drugs had been sold, Tan had no further interest in the drugs he sold and he merely remained in the flat to have a chat with Lim and was not engaged in repacking the drugs. Lim was engaged in repacking the drugs at the request of Foong. His intention was merely to assist Foong. Foong having bought the drugs became the owner thereof. His intention was to keep them for his own consumption and to sell a part thereof to George. Hence, at all material times, the intention of each of the three parties was manifestly different. They were not acting in concert at any material time and there was thus no pre-arranged plan. Counsel relied on the following passage of the judgment of this court in PP v Ho So Mui [1993] 1 SLR(R) 57 at [30]:\n",

      " In our judgment, there was no credible evidence that the appellant was then still suffering from any drug withdrawal symptoms which prevented him from applying his mind to giving the statement. On the basis of all the evidence before him, the learned trial judge was satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the appellant made the s 121 statement voluntarily. We agreed with the learned trial judge’s finding. The trial judge held that the appellant’s repacking of the heroin into smaller and identical packets and the presence of a weighing scale showed that the packets of heroin were for trafficking. The fact that there was a large amount of cash and jewellery found on the appellant, in spite of the fact that the appellant claimed he was unemployed, and his admission in cross-examination that he actually did not make any winnings in lotteries, all went to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was not just in possession of but also a dealer in the heroin. The trial judge therefore held that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking on a balance of probabilities and convicted the appellant. The trial judge found that the gist of the appellant’s defence was that: (a) he did not know the presence of the heroin and the other drug paraphernalia which were hidden in the false ceiling of Room 113; (b) it was Botak who checked into Room 113 on 28 December 1995; (c) Botak was the person who occupied the room all the time and consumed drugs there with his friends; and (d) he went there occasionally on the invitation of Botak, and at most he spent only three nights there as Botak’s guest. The trial judge, however, found on the evidence that Botak had been made use of by the appellant to check into Room 113 on the appellant’s behalf on 28 December 1994 using a false identity card. Thereafter, from that day the appellant had begun to occupy the room, the key being given to the appellant by Botak. The presence of the only key to Room 113 on the appellant, his oral statement to S/Sgt Thng, his s 122(6) and s 121 statements had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession of the heroin. The appellant was convicted of the offence of trafficking in not less than 75.19g of diamorphine contained in 67 sachets and two straws of substance on 9 January 1995 at about 1.45pm in Room 113 of Balestier Hotel, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).

      " Accordingly, we amend the charge as proposed and dismiss the appeal. The next question is whether the proposed amendment of the charge would operate to the prejudice of the appellant in any way. We think not. First, as we have said, the essence of the charge has been clearly spelt out, and the particulars of the charge have been set out in the charge and, apart from the reference to possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking and the reference to ss 5(2) and 17, are substantially correct. The material facts which have been narrated are not in dispute. It may be said that if the charge had initially been framed in the way as we now propose, the appellant might or would not have agreed to the statement of facts as admitted. But with or without that agreed statement, the Prosecution was in a position to adduce overwhelming direct evidence from the narcotics officers to prove that they saw the appellant carrying a white plastic bag and walking from the car park to the void deck of Block 614, Bedok Reservoir Road, at about 8.30pm on 17 February 1995 and that the appellant was arrested by the narcotics officers when he was about to deliver the white plastic bag to a male Chinese, a CNB informer. In his s 121 statement the appellant admitted that he had the white plastic bag at the time and he was on his way to deliver it to the male Chinese. The white plastic bag was found to contain two styrofoam boxes which in turn contained yellowish substance with a diamorphine content of 38.52g. There was therefore clear and direct evidence which established all the ingredients of the offence of drug trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the Act. Before we conclude we need to say a word with regard to the charge that has been framed. In essence, the charge against the appellant is for trafficking in the quantity of drugs concerned and the charge was made on the basis of the appellant having possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, and it refers to ss 5(2) and 17 of the Act. On this the Prosecution was in error. Section 5(2) should not be invoked in this case, as, on the agreed facts, the appellant was transporting and was in the process of delivering the white plastic bag containing the drugs to a male Chinese; his acts clearly fell within the definition of trafficking. As for s 17, it is, in any event, wholly unnecessary to make any reference to that section in the charge; indeed it is not necessary to refer to it at all in any charge under the Act, whether or not s 5(2) is invoked. It is an evidential section; it raises a rebuttable presumption of a certain fact and is no different from the other sections raising rebuttable presumptions of certain facts, eg ss 18–22 of the Act. Hence, even if s 5(2) of the Act is invoked it is still unnecessary to refer to s 17 at all. Having regard to the undisputed facts in this case we need to amend the charge (a) by deleting the words: “by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking” and substituting therefor: “by transporting for the purpose of delivery to a male Chinese”; and (b) by deleting the words: “by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act” and “read with s 5(2)”. The material facts in the instant case are, in substance, similar to those in Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311. There the accused, Tan Ah Tee and Low Hong Eng, were observed by narcotics officers walking towards a car near Block A, Far East Mansion, Kim Yam Road. Tan Ah Tee was seen holding a plastic bag and on approaching the car he was seen handing the bag to Hong Eng. They both went into the car: Ah Tee was the driver and Hong Eng the passenger at the front seat. Ah Tee drove the car all the way to Dickson Road where he stopped. At that point Hong Eng came out of the car holding the plastic bag. The narcotics officers then went up and arrested both of them. The plastic bag was found to contain 459.3g of diamorphine. Both were charged for trafficking in that quantity of drugs. At the trial, after the defence was called, both the accused did not give any evidence in their defence. They were convicted of drug trafficking and on appeal this court dismissed the appeal. Wee Chong Jin CJ referred to the contention advanced on behalf of the accused at [18] as follows:\n",

This was an appeal against the decision of the High Court convicting the appellant on a charge of trafficking in two blocks of substance containing not less than l,587g of cannabis by delivering them to one K Mahendran ('Mahendran') on 17 October 1995 at the Lavender MRT covered linkway at about 11.35am, an offence under s 5(1)(a) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1985 ed) ('the Act').

      " Even though we found that the trial judge erred in relying on the evidence of the paraphernalia found in the Ghim Moh flat as well as that of his previous trafficking activities, we were unable to disturb the conviction. It was patently clear that the trial judge would have been justified in convicting the appellant even had the challenged evidence not been relied on. The appellant had not rebutted the presumptions of possession and knowledge of the nature of the drug. These two elements of the offence were thus made out. He had also given evidence that he was in possession of the package so that he could hand it to M2. This was sufficient to convict without the evidence of the paraphernalia or the similar facts. As such, we were unable to hold that there had been a miscarriage of justice that would have justified quashing the conviction. Applied to the present facts, while due deference should be paid to the trial judge’s own judgment in these matters, we are nevertheless of the opinion that the balance was wrongly struck. The cogency of the evidence is not in doubt since, although the appellant had neither been convicted nor charged with those acts of trafficking, the source of this evidence was his own testimony. The relevance of the evidence is also not in doubt – it was pertinent to the mental state of the appellant when he was transporting the drugs. Where the objection to its admissibility arises is when we consider whether the strength of inference to be drawn from the similar facts is strong enough to tilt the balance. We think not. In Boardman, the House of Lords referred extensively to the test of “striking similarity”. It is now the position of the common law in England that this particular test is only one expression among many of the underlying principle. In R v P, the Lord Chancellor had this to say: While the plain wording of the Evidence Act does seem to adopt a categorisation approach to similar fact evidence, we think it quite clear, without deciding whether similar facts adduced for other purposes can ever be relevant, that at least where the similar facts are being adduced to prove one of the matters identified in ss 14 and 15, a balancing process must take place. Explanation 1 to s 14 states that the similar fact “must show that the state of mind exists not generally but in reference to the particular matter in question”. Illustration (o), in this respect, is instructive. The fact that a person has the habit of shooting at people with intent to kill is irrelevant where he is being tried for the murder of a specific person. The fact that he has previously tried to shoot the same person is, however, relevant. The illustration gives us some guidance as to how the balance should be struck. Similar fact evidence is always prejudicial. In the instant case, the fact that the appellant had previously trafficked in drugs, if allowed to exercise any influence on the mind of the trier of fact, would undoubtedly prejudice the appellant. It is only when the evidence corresponds materially to the present facts that the interests of justice demand that they be admitted. Be that as it may, we are of the opinion that the admission of similar fact evidence, at least for the purposes identified in ss 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act, should be governed by the balancing test adopted by the House of Lords in Boardman’s case. Such an approach is warranted both in principle as well as on the wording of the legislation itself. As to the former, it has been argued above that the rationale of the rule excluding similar fact evidence is so that every person charged with an offence may only be convicted upon being proved to have committed the acts within the charge. It would be subverting established jurisprudence to allow conviction based on the particular disposition of the accused – based on the contention that the accused is that type of person who would commit such an offence. On the other hand, there may be cases where the interest of justice clearly outweigh any prejudicial dangers inherent in the evidence. No doubt, in this jurisdiction, the trial judge being the trier of fact will have to be familiar with the similar facts in order to rule as to its relevance. However, we think ingenuous the argument that a strict enforcement of the similar fact rule is futile if the evidence has already been allowed to infiltrate the mind of the trial judge. All we say in response is that we are far more confident in the ability of judges to disregard prejudicial evidence when the need arises and we refer in this respect to the remarks of this court in Tan Chee Kieng v PP [1994] 2 SLR(R) 577.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, both appellants were rightly convicted of trafficking in 590.23g of cannabis and sentenced with the statutory penalty. Accordingly the appeal of both appellants is dismissed. It follows that the argument that the appellants were wrongly charged for trafficking in 832.3g of cannabis and convicted for trafficking in 590.23g of cannabis when they should have been charged for trafficking in 982.38g of cannabis mixture must fail. In our judgment, therefore, what Dr Lee’s evidence amounts to is that when he had broken down the compressed block of greenish vegetable matter which weighed 982.38g nett, only 852.35g satisfied the macroscopic and microscopic examinations he carried out for cannabis. The chemical tests were carried out on 590.23g of the 852.35g which showed the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol above the average of 0.5% and were proved to be cannabis. Since this was over the 500g of cannabis which attracts the death penalty no chemical tests were carried out on the remainder 362.12g, which had been returned to the investigating officer. In the circumstances the learned trial judge rightly amended the trafficking in cannabis charge from 852.3g to 590.23g. The “fragmented vegetable matter” being small broken pieces from the whole branches (intact branches), as Dr Lee explained in his evidence, did not conclusively satisfy him from the macroscopic and microscopic examinations that they exhibited the characteristic features of cannabis, but on chemical analysis, he detected the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol. All three tests must prove satisfactory to qualify the plant material as cannabis. As the “fragmented vegetable matter” had satisfied only the chemical test, Dr Lee certified it to be cannabis mixture, although strictly speaking the “fragmented vegetable matter” was not a “mixture of vegetable matter”, as we have already explained the scientific evidence clearly showed. It was composed of the same vegetable matter as the “intact branches” but failed to satisfy the macroscopic and microscopic examinations for cannabis. In all correctness Dr Lee should not have certified the “fragmented vegetable matter” as “cannabis mixture” and in our view should have certified that the “fragmented vegetable matter” did not satisfy all three tests he carried out for cannabis, although he found the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol in the “fragmented vegetable matter”. However this does not and could not detract from his evidence that 590.23g of the “intact branches” satisfied all three tests for cannabis.\n",

      " It was for all these reasons that we dismissed the appellant’s appeal without calling upon the learned deputy public prosecutor. We do not find it necessary to refer to the other issues canvassed before us on the appeal. They do not bear on the defence of “own consumption” and in any case are not relevant or are without merit. We should, however, mention that an issue was raised that as the capital charge of trafficking was a “common intention charge” and the learned judge having acquitted the other conspirator, Tay Bee Hoon, the conviction of the appellant without amending the charge was irregular. True, the learned judge did not amend the charge; he found that the appellant alone was in possession of the 40 sachets of heroin and that he failed to make good that he was in possession of the 40 sachets for his and Tay Bee Hoon’s consumption. Suffice it to say that “s 34 of the Penal Code does not create a substantive offence; it lays down only a rule of evidence to infer joint responsibility” (per Thean J (as he then was) in Chota bin Abdul Razak v PP [1991] 1 SLR(R) 501). Accordingly there was nothing irregular about the appellant’s conviction on the capital charge of trafficking. In anticipation that the defence would be that the 40 sachets of heroin found by the CNB officers on top of the wardrobe in the appellant’s bedroom were for his own consumption and that of Tay Bee Hoon, and as already contended by the appellant in his investigation statement, the Prosecution called Dr Leow Kee Fong, the registrar of the Changi Prison Hospital to give expert evidence on drug addiction in general and with reference to the appellant in particular:\n",
      "(a)     The appellant was arrested on 14 July 1995 at about 6.00pm. He was admitted to Changi Prison Hospital on 15 July at about 3.30am for treatment of drug withdrawal. Dr Leow examined the appellant later at 9.15am. The appellant complained of cold sensation, gastric pain and vomiting. He had no diarrhoea. Dr Leow found that, clinically, the appellant’s condition was fair although he appeared lethargic and his pupils were dilated. He was also yawning, with tearing in the eyes and the presence of goose flesh. An examination of his ears and lungs showed normal results. Dr Leow treated the appellant symptomatically for gastric pain and vomiting. He was of the opinion that, clinically, the appellant was suffering from moderate withdrawal symptoms.\n",
      "(b)     Dr Leow examined the appellant again on 17 July. The appellant claimed that he had vomited the day before but this had now stopped. Dr Leow found that the appellant had goose flesh but otherwise he was normal. His pupils were back to normal. There was no dehydration, running nose or tearing of the eyes. The appellant’s condition had clearly improved.\n",
      "(c)     Dr Leow saw the appellant again on 18 July. The appellant had no complaints. There was no goose flesh. The appellant requested to be discharged from the hospital and Dr Leow finding his condition fair duly discharged him.\n",
      "(d)     However at 7.25pm the same day, 18 July, the appellant was referred back to the hospital for psychiatric assessment as the appellant had attempted to assault a CNB officer who was trying to record a statement from him.\n",
      "(e)     Dr Leow saw the appellant at 9.30am on 19 July 1995. He found that the appellant was not experiencing any drug-withdrawal symptoms. From this day to 1 August 1995 Dr Leow saw the appellant on a few occasions and on none of these occasions did the appellant complain of any drug-withdrawal symptoms and Dr Leow also did not find any evidence of the appellant experiencing drug-withdrawal symptoms. The appellant appealed on the conviction of the capital charge of trafficking. We heard his appeal on 23 September 1996 which we dismissed. We now give our reasons.\n",

      " In our judgment, the appellant was rightly convicted of the amalgamated charge, and we dismissed the appeal. The trial judge found that the drugs in the master bedroom and the second bedroom were in the appellant’s possession. He had not rebutted the presumption that he had the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. Consequently, he amalgamated the two charges into a single charge. The trial judge noted that a portion of the 22 sachets in the master bedroom might well have been intended for the appellant’s own consumption. However, there was no evidence that enabled that portion to be quantified. In any case, any adjustment would not affect the mandatory sentence in this case, bearing in mind the total weight of the diamorphine in the amalgamated charge. The appellant and Kua were jointly charged and tried in respect of the first charge and the appellant was charged and tried in respect of the second charge. At the conclusion of the trial, Kua was acquitted, and there is no appeal by the Prosecution against his acquittal. As for the appellant, the trial judge found that he had the two quantities of drugs, the subject matters of the first and second charges, in his possession for the purpose of trafficking and amalgamated the two charges into a single charge to the effect that he had in his possession for the purpose of trafficking not less than 491.19g of diamorphine and convicted him of that charge. Against the conviction the appellant appealed. We dismissed his appeal and now give our reasons. The appellant was convicted in the High Court on a charge of drug trafficking contrary to s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”). At the commencement of the trial, there were two charges preferred against him. The first charge was that on 2 August 1995, he and one Kua Tiong Ann (“Kua”), in furtherance of their common intention, trafficked in 17 packets of substance containing not less than 480.1g of diamorphine by having the drugs in their possession for the purpose of trafficking. The second charge was brought solely against the appellant, and it averred that he had 22 sachets of substance containing not less than 11.09g of diamorphine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.\n",

      " It was for these reasons that we dismissed this appeal. As for point (b), admittedly the tactics employed by the learned deputy public prosecutor at the trial (who was not the deputy public prosecutor at the appeal) were criticised by the learned trial judge but in truth the learned deputy public prosecutor could not be faulted. We have read the transcripts of the evidence and we are satisfied that the learned deputy public prosecutor was not attempting to supplement the Prosecution’s evidence or to withhold material evidence but genuinely desiring to impeach the appellant’s credibility as a witness in view of many inconsistencies in his evidence. We therefore see no substance in this point also. Finally, the learned trial judge invoked the presumption under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act that the appellant’s possession of the six packets of heroin in the white nylon sack containing not less than 294.5g of diamorphine was for the purpose of trafficking and convicted him as the presumption had not been rebutted. But the charge was one of “trafficking by transporting” and not of “trafficking by being in possession”. However that may be, no submissions were made to us that the appellant was transporting the heroin other than for trafficking. The gravamen of the appellant’s defence was that he was duped by Ah Poh into transporting the heroin and that when he discovered that what he was transporting was heroin and not spare parts as he was made to believe, he decided to confront Ah Poh and re-directed the taxi driver to proceed to Golden Mile Complex and not to People’s Park Complex. Presumably what the appellant intended was to return the heroin to Ah Poh and if this was so it would still be trafficking by transporting. See Tan Meng Jee v PP [1996] 2 SLR(R) 178; see also PP v Goh Hock Huat [1994] 3 SLR(R) 375. The appellant was convicted on a charge under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) of trafficking by transporting six packets of heroin containing not less than 294.5g of diamorphine in taxi SH 2894G from Bishan Street 22 to Ophir Road between 11.45am and 12.00noon on 19 July 1996.

In our judgment, a prima facie case has not been made out against Tong at the close of the case for the Prosecution and his defence ought not to have been called. We would therefore allow his appeal. In PP v IC Automation (S) Pte Ltd [1996] 2 SLR(R) 799, the accused was charged with various offences of sales and/or distributions of infringing copies of the complainants’ programs under s 136 of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 1988 Ed). The evidence adduced by the Prosecution was wholly circumstantial. It was held that although it had been proved that the accused had in their possession infringing copies of the complainants’ programs there was no evidence of any sale or distribution and accordingly the learned magistrate held that no prima facie case had been made out at the close of the case for the Prosecution and he acquitted the accused. On appeal Yong Pung How CJ dismissed the appeal. The learned Chief Justice in the course of his judgment said, at [17]–[18]: Clearly, it was for this reason that the Prosecution amended the charge by enlarging the period so as to encompass the earlier alleged act of delivery of the drugs by Tong to found the element of common intention. The Prosecution says that at some point in time during the period between 11 January and 17 January 1996 Tong wrapped the drugs in ten bundles with newspapers and delivered them to Tan at his apartment and at the time of delivery there was in existence the element of common intention, ie to put Tan in possession of the drugs. If these facts were established, the case would be on all fours with Foong Seow Ngui ([20] supra) and the Prosecution would have proved the essential element of common intention. The question then is whether there is any evidence, not inherently incredible, which if accepted, would show that Tong delivered the drugs to Tan at a point of time within this period, ie between 11 and 17 January 1996.\n",

      " For all these reasons we dismissed the appeal. In our view the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had possession of the drugs in question. This triggered the presumption of drug trafficking under s 17 of the Act. As the entire defence of the appellant centred on whether or not he was in possession of the drugs, once possession was proved, there was nothing to rebut the presumption of drug trafficking. Accordingly the appellant was rightly convicted of the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug, ie under s 5(1)(a) of the Act read with s 5(2). The essential question in this appeal is whether or not the Prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession of the drugs in question. Clearly in order to prove that the appellant was in possession, he must have physical control over the drugs. It is a matter of fact whether someone has physical control over an item. Here the storeroom was meant for the appellant and Sgt Soh. Only the appellant and the Sgt Soh were given the keys to the storeroom and the access to the storeroom was through the office shared by the appellant and Sgt Soh. The fact that Sgt Soh can gain access to the storeroom does not mean that the appellant did not have physical control over the drugs. We were satisfied that in this case the appellant had physical control over the drugs in question. Sgt Soh was absent on medical leave that day. Counsel for the appellant submitted that Tan and Kua may have known where the appellant kept the key to the storeroom and that the appellant was used to leaving open the window to his office. If it were the appellant’s case that Tan and Kua may have planted the drugs in the storeroom, then the mental element of possession will not be satisfied, but this will not affect our view as to whether the appellant had physical control over the drugs. Counsel for the appellant contended before us that the procedure was irregular because the effect of it was to place the burden on the appellant to prove that the s 121 statement was involuntary instead of the Prosecution proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the s 121 statement was made voluntarily. This reversal in the order of adducing evidence in the trial within a trial was highly prejudicial to the appellant and resulted in a mistrial of the admissibility issue of the s 121 statement.\n",

      " It was for all these reasons that we dismissed the appeal. We feel that in every case, depending on the circumstances, it is for the trial judge to use his discretion as to whether to order separate trials or to order a joinder of the offences. This is provided for in s 171 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (“CPC”). There are express provisions in the CPC to guide the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion. They are ss 169, 170 and 172. Therefore in all cases, the trial judge should bear in mind the rule of practice that a capital charge should not generally speaking be coupled with a non-capital charge in the same trial. However, if the trial judge feels that the circumstances of the case before him falls within one of the provisions of the CPC relating to the joinder of offences in the same trial and thinks that no prejudice is caused to the accused, it is open to him to allow the offences to be tried together even if one is a capital offence and the other is non-capital. It is of utmost importance that the trial judge must determine that no prejudice is caused to the accused. We take cognizance of this rule of practice and agree that it is a sensible rule of practice and is one that has been incorporated into our common law. We felt however that in the present case, the appellant had not suffered any prejudice by the joinder of the capital charge with the non-capital charge. Both the charges against the appellant were drug-related except that they were for different quantities, one being an amount sufficient to warrant the death sentence and the other not. We think that the trial judge was right in allowing the appellant to be tried for the two offences together and later for amalgamating them into one charge as there was a nexus in terms of proximity in time and location and both the offences also arose from the same set of facts. Furthermore, the standard of proof and the statutory presumptions are the same for the non-capital drug charge as for the capital drug charge. Both were offences under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Act. Only the difference in the quantities made one a capital charge and the other non-capital. The appellant submitted that the rule existed because a capital charge is too serious a matter to be complicated by having alternative counts in the same trial. The appellant relied on the cases of Lee Ah Cheong v R [1958] MLJ 242 and Cheng Seng Heng v Public Prosecutor [1949] MLJ 175 for this proposition. In Lee Ah Cheong v R, there was an appeal against the conviction and sentence of the offences of abduction and the using of a firearm with intent to cause physical injury. The main ground of appeal there was that the jury which tried the case was not summoned according to law. One other matter the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to in that case was the fact that counsel for the appellant had referred to the rule of practice stated in [41] above which was a rule of practice in England. The court felt that as this rule of practice had long been established in the English courts, it was desirable that it should be followed. This view had also been expressed obiter in Cheng Seng Heng’s case.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, we had no hesitation in dismissing the appeal. We noted that in the instant case, the twin presumptions under s 21 and s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act arose and were relied upon to establish the facts of possession and knowledge. The Prosecution could not therefore rely on the presumption under s 17 that the appellant had been in possession of the heroin for the purpose of trafficking, as the presumption under s 17 only arises where possession of the drugs has been proved and not merely presumed under ss 21 and 18: Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP [1995] 3 SLR(R) 689. The appellant contended that the trial judge had erred in admitting the appellant’s cautioned statement recorded on 10 January 1997 as the charge notified to the appellant when he made the statement was different from that which he faced at trial. The main differences lay in that the charge notified to the appellant when he made the statement referred to the gross weight of granular substance found (6,882g) whereas the charge he faced at trial referred to the nett weight of diamorphine (81.89g). Also, the charge notified to the appellant had been one of “trafficking” whereas the charge he faced at trial had been one of “trafficking by transporting”. We saw no merit in this contention. The cautioned statement was admitted so that the statements contained therein could be used to impeach the credit of the appellant under ss 147 and 157 of the Evidence Act, and not for the purpose of drawing an adverse inference under s 123(1) of the CPC from the appellant’s failure to mention particular facts in response to the charge set out in the notice to the appellant or in evidence of the charges against the appellant. The voluntariness of the cautioned statement was also unchallenged. The fact that the charge notified to the appellant when he made the statement was different from that which he faced at trial was therefore irrelevant. In any case, there were no material differences between the two charges. The charge the appellant faced at trial was in substance the same as that notified to him when the cautioned statement was taken, and we did not think that the appellant was misled or prejudiced in any way by the amendments to the charge. It is settled law that an appellate court will not interfere with a trial judge’s finding of fact based on the credibility and veracity of the witnesses whom the trial judge has seen and observed, unless the findings are clearly against the weight of the evidence and unsupportable: PP v Hla Win [1995] 2 SLR(R) 104. In our judgment, the appellant had failed to show that it would have been improbable or impossible for the narcotics officers to have seen what they claimed to have seen. It cannot therefore be argued that the trial judge’s findings were against the weight of the evidence and unsupportable. On the contrary, we were of the view that the trial judge was fully entitled, on the evidence before him, to prefer the evidence of the narcotics officers over that of the appellant. We would add that we refused an application by appellant’s counsel to adduce further evidence to refute the evidence of Cpl Ivan Tan and WNO Delphine Tan by the affidavit evidence of a witness who had since experimentally constructed the observation of a car at the multi-storey car park at Block 505 Bishan Street 11, Lot 118 Deck 3 under similar conditions to 7.05pm on 9 January 1997. Suffice it to say that this “evidence” would not have satisfied any one of the three Ladd v Marshall [1954] 3 All ER 745 tests.\n",

      " Having considered all the evidence carefully, including the further evidence, and for the reasons given above, we accordingly dismissed the appeal of the first appellant and allowed the appeal of the second appellant. However, Ariff must rebut the presumption of knowing possession on a balance of probabilities. Even if the lies in his police statements did not corroborate his guilt, his testimony in court would still have been riddled with inconsistencies which affected his credit. There also remained the incredible version of his entering Singapore to deliver a motor car for rental. Since Ariff had to rebut the presumptions triggered, on the totality of the evidence against him, we took the view that this burden had not been discharged. Our earlier conclusion of his guilt therefore did not change despite the further evidence. Mindful of the Prosecution’s onerous burden of proof (no presumptions were triggered against Azman), we unanimously concluded that this burden had not been discharged beyond a reasonable doubt. Based on the circumstantial evidence (see Nadasan Chandra Secharan v PP [1997] 1 SLR(R) 118), we were unable to draw the inexorable and irresistible inference that Azman had abetted Ariff by having engaged in a conspiracy with him to import the drugs. Therefore, we had to ask ourselves whether the totality of the evidence against Azman was sufficient to prove the case against him beyond a reasonable doubt. But before proceeding further, we had to deal with the further evidence which came before us.\n",

      " Appellant’s counsel obviously had not comprehended what the learned judge meant. What the learned judge meant was that if at the close of the Prosecution’s case the factual evidence of possession of the drugs was not inherently incredible, ie a prima facie case of possession of the drugs was made out, the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the Act would arise. But the Prosecution’s case, to warrant a conviction, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. So, possession, at the end of the trial, whether the appellant gave evidence or not, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If at the end of the trial possession was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt the presumption of trafficking, even if not rebutted, would cease to operate. This lack of comprehension led to defence counsel belabouring “the no case to answer” point. It is clear that this is what the learned judge meant for towards the end of his grounds of judgment he says: The learned judge dismissed the point as being one without merit but defence counsel persisted in it and it was also the main point of his submissions before us. In substance his submission was that P74 was a statement recorded under s 122(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. This could not have been further from the truth as ASP Chew’s evidence is crystal clear that the first lot of questions were asked of the appellant at the void deck on the ground floor of Block 438 immediately following the appellant’s arrest. The second set of questions were asked in the master bedroom of flat #04-1341 as soon as the appellant, ASP Chew and the escorting narcotic officers had arrived there and the appellant had indicated with his chin to the wardrobe as to where “the anything” was. It was plainly and simply a contemporaneous note of the oral statements made by the appellant immediately following his arrest, no doubt prompted by the questions put to him. “Investigation” as one understands it, in the context of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) or otherwise could hardly have begun so immediately following the arrest. In our view, the oral statements are relevant as they go to show that the appellant had the knowledge of the nature of the substances he was in possession of and form part of the transaction of being in possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking. They are therefore relevant and admissible under ss 6 and 5 respectfully of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (see Chi Tin Hui v PP [1994] 1 SLR(R) 313 at [27]). P74 was but a contemporaneous record of the oral statements. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death on a charge of trafficking in a controlled drug specified in class “A” of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1997 Ed) (“the Act”) by having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking at his flat at Block 438, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, #04-1341, Singapore, not less than 32.31g of diamorphine, without any authorisation under the Act or the regulations made thereunder, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Act.

      " For the reasons given above, we were of the view that the identity of the appellant as the person who placed the heroin in the dry riser compartment was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The appeal was accordingly dismissed. The question in this appeal was whether it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the person in light coloured T-shirt and white shoes who placed the heroin in the dry riser compartment at about 17:26 hours. The classic statement on the meaning of the phrase “proof beyond reasonable doubt” is that of Denning J (as he then was) in Miller v Ministry of Pensions [1947] 2 All ER 372 where he said: The point raised by Lord Widgery is pertinent to our present case. In his cross-examination, the appellant made a reversal of his earlier evidence, and admitted that the evidence he had put up during his examination-in-chief was made up by him. Although the appellant’s admission of lying affected the appellant’s credibility, it was not safe to rely on it as supporting evidence for either Cpl Shadikin or Mohd Khermi’s identification evidence. An admission from the appellant that he told lies about where he was at the material time does not by itself prove that he was the one who placed the black plastic bag containing the heroin into the dry riser compartment at the Plaza. It is only where the judge is satisfied that the sole reason for the fabrication is to deceive him and there is no other explanation for its being put forward can fabrication provide any support for identification evidence. If so, the second question should be this. Is the identification evidence of good quality, taking into account the circumstances in which the identification by the witness was made? A non-exhaustive list of factors which could be considered include the length of time that the witness observed the accused, the distance at which the observation was made, the presence of obstructions in the way of the observation, the number of times the witness had seen the accused, the frequency with which the witness saw the accused, the presence of any special reasons for the witness to remember the accused, the length of time which had elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to the police and the presence of material discrepancies between the description of the accused as given by the witness and the actual appearance of the accused. In considering the circumstances in which the identification was made, the judge should take note of any specific weaknesses in the identification evidence. If after evaluation of the identification evidence, the judge is satisfied that the quality of the identification is good, he may then go on to safely assess the value of the identification evidence.\n",

      " In the premises, counsel’s submission that the learned judicial commissioner had erred in drawing an adverse inference against the appellant for electing to remain silent without first satisfying himself that the Prosecution had made out a case which if unrebutted would warrant the appellant’s conviction was simply unsustainable. The failure of the appellant to call any evidence had the result that the confession of the first accused and the statement of Goh were not out-weighed by any other evidence in favour of the appellant capable of raising a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we dismissed this appeal. In other words, the court in deciding whether a case has been made out warranting the conviction of the accused will act on the presumptions that: (a) all evidence of primary facts is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and (b) there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or the state of mind of the accused that would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation: see the landmark case of Haw Tua Tau v PP [1981–1982] SLR(R) 133. L P Thean J (as he then was), delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Sim Ah Cheoh v PP ([53] supra) at [29]–[30], referred to Haw Tua Tau and thereafter clarified as follows: Counsel for the appellant had sought to argue in the court below that the learned judicial commissioner should adopt the approach to s 30 of the Evidence Act as enunciated in Tan Siew Chay v PP ([32] supra). This approach, which was also followed by the court in Sim Ah Cheoh v PP ([53] supra) and Ramachandran a/l Suppiah v PP [1993] 2 SLR(R) 392, was that the confession of a co-accused could only play a supportive role in a criminal prosecution and could not by itself form the basis of a conviction. It was therefore submitted that the learned judicial commissioner should consider the other evidence adduced by the Prosecution and only after that could he refer to the statements of the first accused. This line of cases (of which Ramachandran was the most recent) has, however, been overruled by the Court of Appeal decision in Chin Seow Noi v PP ([34] supra). The position now is that s 30 allows the conviction of an accused to be sustained solely on the basis of a confession by his co-accused, provided that the evidence emanating from that confession satisfied the court beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt. Although counsel for the appellant did not seek to advance the pre-Chin Seow Noi approach again before this court, we felt compelled to reaffirm that the correct approach to the application of s 30 was as stated by this court in Chin Seow Noi. In any event, s 30 was not of immediate importance in the present case. Although the confession of the first accused was crucial in implicating and convicting the appellant, it was not the only evidence relied upon by the Prosecution. There was also the statement of Goh and the circumstantial evidence, all of which when taken together were more than sufficient to justify the finding of the learned judicial commissioner that the Prosecution had made out a case which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction. On the facts of our case, there was no reasonable doubt that the appellant had abetted the first accused by conspiring with the latter to export the drugs. The evidence of the first accused taken together with the statement of Goh and the other evidence adduced by the Prosecution, were unambiguous and clearly implicated himself and the appellant. Indeed, the circumstantial evidence in this case alone more than justified the inference that the appellant had committed the offence with which he was charged. In a case such as the present, the question that the court must ask itself was stated succinctly by Huggins J in R v Chau Sau Tai [1969] HKLR 214, which is whether, in respect of each alleged conspirator, the court is satisfied that, on the evidence as a whole, he must have conspired with one or more of the others. The answer, in the present case, must be in the affirmative.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal of both Cheng and Sum and upheld their convictions. In light of the inconsistencies in, and the inadequacy of, Sum’s explanation as to how he came to be in possession of P93 and P98 and the reasons for his trip to Singapore on 22 July 1997, there was no basis for contending that the learned trial judge erred in rejecting Sum’s defence and in finding that the latter had failed to rebut the statutory presumptions operating against him under the Misuse of Drugs Act. We therefore dismissed Sum’s appeal. Thus, we dismissed Cheng’s appeal as the elements which constitute the offence of drug trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, namely, the accused (a) has possession of the controlled drug in question, (b) has done the act of trafficking in one of the forms set out in s 2 of the Act, and (c) has knowledge of the nature of the drug which he was in possession of (Tan Meng Jee v PP [1996] 2 SLR(R) 178), had been made out. In the present case, since Cheng was presumed to have had possession of the diamorphine by virtue of having been found in possession of P93 and P98 which contained the drugs (s 18(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act), the statutory presumption in s 17 that he had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking could not be invoked as it was not proved that he had the drugs in his possession (Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP [1995] 3 SLR(R) 689). It could, however, be inferred that Cheng had been transporting the drugs for the purpose of trafficking based on the alternative line of reasoning enunciated by Lord Diplock in Ong Ah Chuan v PP ([40] supra at [14]):\n",

      " We therefore concluded that all the elements of the offence with which the appellants were charged had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly we dismissed the appeal and confirmed the mandatory sentence of death passed on them. The Prosecution’s case was that the common intention of the appellants was to put the first appellant in possession of the drugs, pursuant to the prearranged plan of them both. The learned judicial commissioner found that the acts of both appellants went even further in that they resulted in both of them having possession of the drugs. We agree. Both appellants obviously knew that what they were handling were drugs, specifically, heroin. In the circumstances, there was simply no room for the argument that they lacked the requisite knowledge. Both had acted in concert in moving the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop. In addition, both had access to the shop in the form of the key to the door. They thus had physical control of the drugs. Both appellants had unpacked the drugs from the three sports bags and repacked them into one sports bag and a carton. They had also placed some drug-trafficking paraphernalia into the sports bag. The second appellant had returned to the shop on four separate occasions between 7 and 9 March 1998, the period when the drugs were stored in the shop. The conclusion that possession had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt could not be faulted. Counsel did not explain the relevance of the question whether it was Nor Azman or the first appellant who had asked the second appellant to move the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop, nor were we able to discern it ourselves. Surely it was immaterial whether it was Nor Azman or the first appellant who was responsible for asking the second appellant to move the drugs, as what was crucial was that the second appellant had indeed done so in pursuance of his common intention with the first appellant. This was not disputed. As for the other alleged inconsistencies, we did not think they were at all material. The train of events leading up to and resulting in the removal of the drugs from TG Mansion to the shop had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. In this respect, the appellants’ statements essentially coincided on material points. We have already set these out at [65] above when dealing with the similar submission of counsel for the first appellant that there were numerous inconsistencies between the statements of the first and second appellants, and see no need to repeat what we have said here. We had no doubt that the first appellant had physical control over the drugs. He had access to the shop in the form of the key to the lock to the door. The oral answers given by him to Insp Krishnan in the shop on the day of the arrest showed unequivocally that not only did the first appellant know that the drugs and drug-trafficking paraphernalia were present in the shop but also the weight of the drugs in the sports bag and the number of packets in the carton. His long statement described how the drugs were packed. Possession had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.\n",

      " In the circumstances, a case of trafficking in 147.58g of heroin had clearly been made out against the appellant and the trial judge had in our view rightly convicted the appellant of the offence. Accordingly we dismissed the appellant’s appeal and confirmed the sentence of death. In light of the above, it was clear that the two contentions put forward by the appellant were totally without merit. On the other hand, the Prosecution had proven all the necessary ingredients of the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant was found to be in possession of no less than 147.58g of heroin, inclusive of the amount in the five packets of drugs contained in the grey Bata bag. There was consequently a presumption under s 17 of the MDA that the appellant had such drugs for the purposes of trafficking. Applying the law to our facts, we were of the view that the failure by the Prosecution to call SSgt Tai and Sgt Phao as witnesses should not lead to an adverse inference being drawn against it under s 116 illus (g). It was clear from our earlier discussion that the two named officers were not material or indispensable witnesses in the Prosecution’s case. The chain of evidence concerning the drug exhibits had been established beyond a reasonable doubt even without relying on their testimonies as there was other independent evidence in the form of Insp Goh’s testimony which would point conclusively to the fact that the drugs placed in the boot of the CNB car were those seized from the flat. The calling of the two officers would in the circumstances have been unnecessary and redundant and the failure on the Prosecution’s part to do so should consequently not lead to an adverse inference being drawn against it. We noted that counsel for the appellant did not contend that there were any further breaks in the chain of evidence during any other period of time. Indeed the evidence below shows no mishandling of the drug exhibits subsequent to the time they were placed in the boot of the CNB staff car. Insp Goh personally removed the plastic bag containing the drug exhibits from the boot after its arrival at the MIB and carried it to her office where she locked it up in her personal steel cabinet, to which only she had the keys. She also testified that there were no other drug exhibits in her cabinet at the material time since this was her first drug trafficking case. She also personally oversaw the weighing of the drugs and undertook the marking and sealing of the drugs herself, taking care to ensure that the drug exhibits were locked away as soon as the tasks were completed. She further personally handed the drug exhibits to Dr Lee of DSS for analysis. Dr Lee also properly stored the drugs in his steel cabinet pending analysis and, during analysis, found the seals to be unbroken. We further noted that the drugs seized and photographed at the appellant’s flat consisted of a total of 160 sachets, seven packets, one bowl and one phial – see para 5 of Insp Goh’s statement marked PS 19. The drugs re-marked and sent to the DSS for analysis also consisted of a total of 160 sachets, seven packets, one bowl and one phial of drugs. It was clear that the figures tallied down to the last sachet. In the circumstances, we were satisfied that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drug exhibits analysed by Dr Lee were the same drugs that were seized from the appellant’s flat. The defence of breach in the chain of evidence accordingly failed.\n",

      " In summary, the thrust of the arguments mounted above missed the point. Even if Raseed was an unreliable witness who failed to account for money in his possession, he was not under the burden of discharging any presumption raised against him. The matters raised by the appellant did not found any proper basis for the inference that Raseed was the true mastermind of the operation to the exclusion of Aziz. At most, it only suggested his complicity in the events. The court below was however not satisfied that this was proven beyond a reasonable doubt in the absence of compelling direct evidence implicating Raseed. In contrast, the direct evidence and incredibility of Aziz’s testimony weighed heavily against him. Accordingly, he failed on a balance of probabilities to rebut the relevant presumption. We wondered whether the learned trial judge ought to have amended the charge before convicting Aziz of the charge of trafficking by being in possession of the cannabis and the cannabis mixture. Counsel for Aziz did not suggest any prejudice to Aziz by the learned trial judge not amending the joint charge before convicting Aziz. In fact our careful perusal of the record of proceedings revealed that the mode of trial and Aziz’s defence were not prejudiced by the joint charge not being amended. In the circumstances the conviction of Aziz on the joint charge was perfectly proper. It will be remembered that Aziz and Raseed were jointly charged that pursuant to the common intention of them both they had committed the offence of trafficking in controlled drugs by being in possession of cannabis and cannabis mixture. At the end of the trial the learned trial judge found as a fact that Aziz alone was in possession of the cannabis and the cannabis mixture. Accordingly he acquitted Raseed of the joint charge as common intention had not been proved against him and proceeded to convict Aziz on the joint charge. Possession having been proved against Aziz, the presumptions under ss 17 and 18(2) then operate. There was also no challenge that the vegetable matter found in his possession were controlled drugs within the meaning of s 5(1) read with s 2 of the Act, namely, cannabis and cannabis mixture. Thus, subject to Aziz’s successful rebuttal of these presumptions, the Prosecution had established all the elements of the offence in question.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal. In view of the large quantity of drugs and the existence of paraphernalia commonly associated with trafficking, we were satisfied that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption under s 17 of the Act. Accordingly, there was no question in our minds that all the elements of the charge of trafficking under s 5(2) of the Act had been established and that the appellant was properly convicted. In the circumstances, we were satisfied that the appellant was in possession of the paraphernalia. He admitted in court that he knew of the existence of the electric sealer and digital weighing scale found in the living room, which he alleged were brought to the flat by Lau some three weeks before his arrest. Further, as we indicated above, we agreed with the trial judge’s finding that the appellant was the sole occupier of the flat. The trial judge therefore did not err in holding that the electric sealer and digital weighing scale found in the living room belonged to the appellant, as did the other paraphernalia found in the flat. In our opinion, the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the drug-trafficking paraphernalia found in the flat was in the appellant’s possession. However, before such evidence could be relied on, the Prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the paraphernalia was in the appellant’s possession (Tan Meng Jee v PP [1996] 2 SLR(R) 178). In the present case, the appellant’s defence was that these items did not belong to him. He claimed that the electric sealer and digital weighing scale found in the living room were kept at the flat by Lau for a friend, while he disclaimed any knowledge of the second electric sealer and digital weighing scale found in the kitchen, as well as the packet of empty plastic sachets. The trial judge did not believe the appellant’s claims. It was significant that one of the electric sealers, the one found on the shelf in the living room, was plugged into the power socket, indicating that it was being used. The appellant could only offer the lame explanation that when he saw the sealer, it was not plugged in. As for the digital weighing scale, it was found in the same plastic packet as the blue notebook which the appellant admitted belonged to him. The appellant also could not offer an explanation as to how they came to be found together. While none of the items, including the sealer and digital weighing scale found in the kitchen, were sent for fingerprint testing, this was not fatal to the Prosecution’s case. Insp Krishnan testified that in his experience it was practically impossible for fingerprints to be lifted off the surface of similar electric sealers. He also explained that the powders used in fingerprint tests would interfere with any trace of drugs which might be on the items.\n",

      " For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the court below. Apart from the inherent improbabilities highlighted above, the appellant’s incriminating statements to the CNB officers clearly contradicted his assertions in court that the drugs had been placed there by Razak. He admitted to SSgt Rusdi that the drugs found in the car belonged to him and stated in his cautioned statement that he was solely responsible for the drugs. It was puzzling why the appellant would have made such admissions if indeed Razak was the one responsible for all the drugs. The appellant’s explanations were unsatisfactory. He alleged that the officers would not have believed him even if he had told them that the drugs did not belong to him. We were unable to find any logical basis for the appellant’s unilateral assumption that it would have been futile to deny ownership of the drugs. Even if the officers might have been sceptical about such assertions considering that the appellant had been caught red-handed with the drugs in the boot of his car, it was certainly unnecessary for the appellant to further claim in his statement to SSgt Rusdi that the drugs belonged to him if the truth was that Razak had placed the drugs in the boot. His other explanation for taking responsibility for the drugs in order to absolve his wife of any liability was equally unconvincing. As rightly pointed out by the trial judge, the appellant could have simply stated from the outset that the drugs were placed there by Razak without implicating his wife. In our view, the appellant’s failure to raise his defence until the trial seriously affected his credibility and rendered his testimony less likely to be believed. Hence, in our opinion, the trial judge was fully justified in drawing the irresistible inference from his various admissions that the appellant, being fully aware that the diamorphine was in the boot of his motorcar, had intentionally brought and therefore imported the diamorphine into Singapore. We found no reason to disturb this crucial finding of fact. It was undisputed that the appellant must possess the requisite actus reus and mens rea at the time the offence was committed before he could be convicted of the offence. Hence, if the appellant could raise a reasonable doubt that he did not know that the drugs were in the car at the time he entered Singapore, the Prosecution would not have proven its case. However, this is not an easy burden to discharge. The appellant did not deny that he had physically brought the diamorphine into Singapore. Thus, the sole issue on appeal was whether the appellant had intentionally imported the diamorphine into Singapore. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that there was a reasonable doubt that he was not aware of the presence of the drugs in the boot of the car at the time he arrived at Singapore and that he did not have the intention to bring the drugs into Singapore or that he did not do so knowingly. The defence counsel relied on the English case of R v Ingram [1975] Crim LR 457 where it was held that a defence of forgetfulness could effectively negative the element of mens rea in an offence for theft. It was submitted that the drugs had been placed in the boot of the car by Razak who subsequently alighted from the car without taking the drugs with him. The defence counsel further submitted that the appellant’s mind was so consumed with other thoughts at that time that he had failed to notice that Razak did not remove the drugs from the boot of the car. The appellant was allegedly distracted by thoughts of his appointment with Kamin, his squabble with his wife and his pending trip to the car repair shop. Thus, the first time the appellant remembered about the drugs in the boot was after his arrest at the Woodlands checkpoint.\n",

      " In the light of the foregoing reasons, we found the separate charges against the two appellants established beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore upheld the convictions and mandatory death sentences passed by the trial judge and dismissed both the appeals. In summary, we found that Boksenang’s allegations were self-contradictory and inherently improbable on the facts of the case. The evidence he gave to support his claims were inconsistent and the assertions were not otherwise sustained by objective evidence. On the other hand, Insp Muru’s evidence was clearly substantiated by the testimony of the interpreter, refuting the bare allegations raised by Boksenang. As the trial judge had the benefit of hearing and seeing the witnesses give evidence and was in the position to test their credibility and veracity in the witness box, the appellate court should be slow to disturb the findings that were reached by him. We saw no reason to depart from the findings made by the learned judge and affirmed his decision that the statement in P47 was made voluntarily and was admissible as evidence. After reviewing the evidence, the trial judge reached the finding that the alleged statements were never made by Insp Muru to procure the making of P47. He observed that Boksenang was not entirely consistent in his complaints and in the course of the voir dire, he even sought to embellish his allegations, adding that Insp Muru had also threatened him with indefinite detention if he failed to cooperate, even though this serious allegation was never mentioned before and neither was it put to Insp Muru or the interpreter. In the course of his oral testimony in the voir dire, Boksenang also gave somewhat contradictory accounts of how the recording of P47 took place. At first, he claimed that Insp Muru did not tell him what to say and would ask questions which he would then answer. However, he later said that Insp Muru had taught him the contents of nearly the whole statement and that Insp Muru was the one who provided the answers to the questions, which formed the details in the statement. In addition, although Boksenang alleged that he was compelled by Insp Muru to make a statement that was consistent with those made by Sharom, a careful perusal of P47 showed that it was not actually consistent since Sharom’s account of the events that took place on 19 March 1999 (Friday) at the Jelapang flat had significant differences from Boksenang’s version. This did not gel with Boksenang’s claim that he made P47 to satisfy the demands for consistency with and corroboration of Sharom’s statements. Furthermore, Sharom’s statements were all recorded before Boksenang’s first statement was even taken, therefore if Insp Muru had wanted consistency with Sharom’s statements, he could have demanded for it in Boksenang’s earlier statements and not wait until his third long statement. In any case, we noticed that his earlier statements were not contradictory to the events as recorded in P47 as all the statements each dealt with distinct events. Hence, there appeared to be little reason for Insp Muru to be displeased with Boksenang’s earlier statements, as was suggested, such that he had to resort to the use of inducement, threat or promise to procure P47 when none had been necessary in the recording of the earlier statements. The promise to procure a reduced charge would also amount to an obvious inducement to give a good statement in exchange for a non-capital charge. In Poh Kay Keong v PP ([47] supra), the court was of the view that if such a promise had indeed been made, it would have been clear enough to vitiate the confession. The same would apply for a threat of indefinite detention, which could certainly induce an accused to confess in order to avoid the punishment of prolonged confinement. On the other hand, we did not think that the same could be said of a mere reference to statements made by a co-accused, an accomplice or even a witness. It was argued by counsel for Boksenang that Insp Muru’s reference to Sharom’s statements during the recording of P47 induced Boksenang to make the statement when he would not have done so otherwise. We were unable to agree with this contention. It was difficult to see how an accused person could perceive gaining any advantage or avoiding any evil by making a self-incriminating statement simply because he was told what his co-accused had said. On the contrary, it would seem proper that the accused should be kept informed of what kind of allegations have been made against him by other accused persons or witnesses so that he may properly defend himself against such allegations. Indeed, references to such other statements would assist the accused in deciding on what he should say to best present his defence and therefore should not be regarded as an inducement rendering the statement involuntary.\n",

      " The appellant’s sole contention on appeal centred on the issue of possession. Contrary to the appellant’s submission, the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt the appellant’s possession of the diamorphine. Nothing was raised in the court below and nothing raised on appeal which rebutted the s 17(c) presumption of drug trafficking triggered by the proof of the appellant’s possession of not less than 130.46g of diamorphine. For these reasons, we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the sentence. The appeal contested the trial judge’s finding that these two elements of possession were satisfied. In respect of physical control, the appellant argued that the trial judge erred in failing to give due weight to the fact that the appellant did not have exclusive possession of the flat and that there were visitors who went to play mahjong at the flat who could have entered the storeroom. We had several difficulties with this argument. The appellant was charged with trafficking in a controlled drug, an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”). Section 5(2) of the Act states that a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. Section 17(c) of the Act provides a presumption concerning trafficking. It states that any person proved to have possession of more than 2g of diamorphine shall be presumed to have that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose. The appellant’s assertion of total ignorance of the contents was rejected by the trial judge. In the trial judge’s view, the circumstances in which the appellant came into possession of the bag, if true, were so suspicious that it would require a totally mindless person to have done what the appellant claimed he did. Even if he did not suspect anything illicit, he surely would have enquired from Ah Beh or his two associates what the contents were. He would have needed to know if the contents were fragile or perishable in order to discharge his duties responsibly. At the least, he would have opened the bag for a peek, for it was not as if he had been instructed not to look. He did not bother to ask why the bag should be kept by him for a few days. All of this was compounded by the fact that the owner of the bag was not only someone unknown to him, but a former prison inmate. The trial judge therefore found that the appellant clearly knew that what he was receiving and keeping was a controlled drug.\n",

      " In this case, possession of 32.27g of diamorphine was proven beyond reasonable doubt. The presumption under s 17 MDA was triggered. The appellant’s election to remain silent, refusal to call any witnesses, failure to explain his possession of the drug and to present final submissions at the trial, made it impossible for him to discharge the burden of rebutting the presumption against him, or to cast reasonable doubt on the case. There was no compelling reason to fault the trial judge’s decision to admit the three long statements. For the above reasons, we dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction and sentence. In the circumstances, both the appellant’s physical possession of the haversack that contained the drug, as well as the appellant’s knowledge of the content of the haversack were proven beyond reasonable doubt. The statutory presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking under s 17 MDA was triggered. That made out the offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) MDA. The appellant’s silence and failure to adduce any evidence to show that the drug was not for the purpose of trafficking necessarily meant that a guilty verdict was amply justified. Counsel’s submission that the trial judge erred in drawing an adverse inference against the appellant was unsustainable. As seen in Murray v Director of Public Prosecutions [1994] 1 WLR 1 and Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP [1998] 3 SLR(R) 619, a proper inference under s 196(2) CPC included the drawing of an inference that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged. The trial judge would necessarily have borne in mind whether taking into account all the other circumstances, a guilty inference was justifiable. As evinced in Murray and Haw Tua Tau ([46] supra), it is a common-sense test. Intervention by an appellant court would only be exercised if it was obvious from the records that such negative inference was unjustifiable or unreasonable. There were objections to the admissibility of the evidence in these three statements. Voluntariness was made an issue. A voir dire ensued. On this, the law is settled, as seen in various authorities such as Gulam bin Notan Mohd Shariff Jamalddin v PP [1999] 1 SLR(R) 498, Seow Choon Meng v PP [1994] 2 SLR(R) 338 and Poh Kay Keong v PP ([20] supra).

      " In the light of the above, we found that the Prosecution had proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt and that the appellant was rightly convicted. We therefore dismissed the appeal. Even if it could be successfully argued that the Prosecution had failed to prove that the appellant had knowledge that the 32 slabs of substance contained opium, the appeal would still fail. The appellant was seen by the CNB officers driving his car from Dover Road to Jalan Kukoh, and at Jalan Kukoh when he was about to pick up Ang, he and Ang were arrested. At the time of his arrest, the officers found in his car 32 slabs of substance which, subsequently on analysis, were found to contain 49,168g of opium containing 990.05g of morphine. On these facts, the appellant was not only in physical possession of the drugs. He was doing more than that. He was transporting the drugs from a point unknown to Dover Road and from Dover Road to Jalan Kukoh and was in the process of delivering the drugs to various persons, including Ang. This was not a case of passive possession of the drugs on the part of the appellant, but one where the appellant was found to be transporting or delivering the drugs. On these facts, there was no necessity for the Prosecution to invoke s 5(2) of the Act and rely on the presumption under s 17 that the appellant at the material time had possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. On these facts, the Prosecution could have preferred a charge under s 5(1)(a) of the Act that the appellant trafficked in the quantity of opium by transporting or delivering it. If the Prosecution had done so, it could invoke the presumption under s 18 of the Act that the drugs were in the possession of the appellant as the owner of the car or as the person in charge of the car at the material time. In such a case, the possession of the drugs would be presumed and not proved. This presumption would operate against the appellant, and the burden would then rest on the appellant to rebut this presumption, on a balance of probabilities. In that the appellant had failed. The learned judge rejected his evidence that he did not know the contents of the 32 slabs of substance. We agreed with the learned judge. The appellant in his evidence sought to show that he was an innocent courier engaged by one Ah Seow to deliver “the goods” for a sum of $500. Purely on the basis of his evidence, the entire course of dealings between him and Ah Seow was gravely suspect. For a start, the appellant had only met Ah Seow once before he was engaged by the latter to deliver the goods in question. He was engaged by Ah Seow on the evening of 10 April 1999 (the day before his arrest), and at that time Ah Seow was for all intents and purposes a stranger to him. Having been so engaged by Ah Seow, he met up with Ah Seow, and trustingly allowed Ah Seow to load the bags of substance into the trunk of his car, apparently without even asking about their contents or checking them. While the bags were being loaded into the car he found that some smell was emitting from the bags; yet he did not check or ask what the goods were. He said that he thought they were herbs. After the bags were loaded, Ah Seow gave no clear and specific instructions as to the addresses of the persons to whom the bags were to be delivered. Instead he was given a slip with cryptic numbers or messages for delivery. Further, Ah Seow for some inexplicable reasons only gave instructions later as to the addresses of the persons to whom the deliveries were to be made. In these circumstances, it would have been obvious to even the most naïve of persons that there was something highly illicit in the goods he was asked to deliver. In this case, the appellant at the time of his arrest was found to have in his control the 32 slabs of substance, and that was proved by the Prosecution and was not disputed in the defence. It was also proved, and also not disputed that the 32 slabs of substance contained 49,168g of opium containing not less than 990.05g of morphine. What was clearly disputed, which the Prosecution had to prove, was the element of mens rea, ie that the appellant knew that the 32 slabs of substance contained opium. Only when that element was proved, would the presumption under s 17 of the Act arise, and the burden would then be on the appellant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the quantity of opium in his possession was for purposes other than trafficking.\n",

      " For the reasons we have given, we agree with the findings of the judge that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Suboh, at the material time, had physical custody of the drugs as well as the requisite mens rea, ie that he knew that the blue bag found in the flat contained the drugs. The Prosecution therefore had proved that Suboh had possession of the drugs, and as the quantity of the drugs in his possession exceeded 2g of diamorphine, there arose the presumption under s 17(c) of the Act that he had possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, and no evidence had been adduced by Suboh to rebut this presumption. Consequently, by reason of s 5(2) of the Act, he committed the offence of trafficking. Accordingly, Suboh’s appeal is also dismissed. We now turn to consider whether the Prosecution has proved that Suboh had possession of the drugs. In discharging this burden, the Prosecution has to prove (a) that Suboh had physical custody of the quantity of substance, and (b) that he knew that the quantity of substance contained drugs: Fun Seong Cheng v PP [1997] 2 SLR(R) 796, Su Chee Kiong v PP [1999] 1 SLR(R) 142 and Gulam bin Notan Mohd Shariff Jamalddin v PP [1999] 1 SLR(R) 498. In this appeal it is essential to bear in mind what the charge was that was brought against Suboh. The charge against him was that he had possession of the drugs in question for the purpose of trafficking, and under s 5(2) of the Act he thereby committed the offence of trafficking in the drugs. To make good this charge the Prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Suboh had possession of the drugs at the material time: Low Kok Wai v PP [1994] 1 SLR(R) 64, PP v Wan Yue Kong [1995] 1 SLR(R) 83 and Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP [1995] 3 SLR(R) 689. Once this burden is discharged, the presumption under s 17(c) that he had possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking is triggered, and the burden is then on Suboh to show on the balance of probabilities that the drugs were for purposes other than trafficking. At any rate, even if the judge had rejected Salam’s evidence on the ground that Salam was untruthful and unreliable, and convicted Salam of the charge, we do not see how such a result would or could have any effect or impact on the defence of Suboh. It certainly would not exonerate him from the charge. Salam’s lies, which were relied on heavily in the argument by Suboh’s counsel, concerned only Salam himself and does not impinge on Suboh’s defence or guilt. The judge certainly did not rely on Salam’s lies to convict Suboh. The evidence of Salam on which the judge relied in acquitting him has no bearing on the defence of Suboh in relation to the charge.\n",

      " In our judgment, the evidence against the appellant was overwhelming, and the trial judge’s finding that the charge against the appellant had been proved beyond reasonable doubt was fully supported by the evidence. We agree with his finding. We therefore dismiss the appeal. As regards the statement of facts, P46, he initially admitted, then denied that the statement of facts was read to him when he pleaded guilty to the drug trafficking charges. He admitted that the charges were read to him and that he had pleaded guilty to the charges against him but was not able to remember the subsequent proceedings; specifically, he could not remember whether he had admitted to the statement of facts. When he was asked by the trial judge, he confirmed that whatever he pleaded guilty to or admitted to was done out of fear. However, he conceded that the charges against him were true but asserted that the contents of P46 was untrue. When he was questioned by defence counsel, he agreed to the suggestion that he was prepared to admit to the statement of facts in order to escape the gallows, and was not concerned about the truth of the contents after the charges against him were reduced. When confronted with the statements, Katheraven proffered various explanations for the contradictions, and he retracted the material parts of the statements which implicated the appellant. He testified that he gave the statement, P29, in fear as the investigating officer told him that he would be hanged. He readily agreed to a suggestion to implicate the appellant as he wanted to save himself from the gallows, and to induce the investigating officer to believe him. He admitted, however, that the investigating officer had not promised him anything in exchange for implicating the appellant. When he was questioned further, he explained that the only reason he subsequently implicated the appellant in P29 was because he was afraid that something might happen to him. When he was pressed further as to why he chose to implicate the appellant, he explained that this was because “he’s my friend” and “[b]ecause he was arrested and taken to MIB with me”. Mr Sidambaram submits that the statement was pre-prepared and was brought to Katheraven while he was in the lock-up in the Supreme Court immediately after he had pleaded guilty to the charges, that Katheraven signed it out of fear and that he signed the statement even though the contents were false, and that at that time Katheraven would have signed any document placed before him. For this reason, he submits that P49 is unreliable and no weight should be attached to that document.\n",

      " In light of our findings above, we found that the judicial commissioner rightly convicted Ramis of the offence as charged. We therefore dismissed the appeal against conviction and sentence. Since it was our decision that Ramis had both physical control and knowledge of the drugs, we found that the element of possession was satisfied. The presumption under s 17 of the Act as to the purpose of possession then kicked in. Thus, by s 17(d) of the Act, he was presumed to have had the cannabis in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. This presumption had not been rebutted by Ramis. However, before the Prosecution could rely on this presumption, it first had to prove the element of possession. The meaning of “possession” was discussed by Lord Pearce in Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 2 AC 256, and followed by this court in the case of Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311. A long line of cases has since followed the ruling in these cases. Essentially, in order to prove possession, the Prosecution had to satisfy two elements: firstly, it had to prove that Ramis had physical control of the cannabis and, secondly, that Ramis knew that what he had under his physical control was cannabis: see Lee Lye Hoe v PP [2000] SGCA 55, Zulfikar bin Mustaffah v PP [2001] 1 SLR(R) 181 and Lim Beng Soon v PP [2000] 3 SLR(R) 213. To discharge its burden of proof, the Prosecution had to prove possession of the drugs on the part of Ramis for the purposes of trafficking. The Prosecution sought to rely on the presumption relating to purpose of possession in s 17 of the Act, which reads as follows:\n",

      " For the above reasons, we dismissed the appeal. The reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the above observations was that the appellant’s story as to how he came into possession of the bag was obviously cooked up to distance himself from any knowledge that he might have had as to the bag’s contents. We were more inclined to draw the inference that the appellant knew what the five bundles contained. Such an inference would be supported by the fact that, at the time of his arrest, the appellant was found to be in possession of $4,890 in cash, denominated in S$10 and S$50 notes. His explanation that these were the proceeds from his gambling winnings was ridiculous. Firstly, it is highly unusual for an unemployed man to go around carrying such large amounts of cash in his pocket. Secondly, he claimed to have won the moneys two to three weeks before his arrest, so that did not explain why he was still carrying the moneys on the day he was arrested. Even Choo JC was still “not entirely satisfied with his account of how he came into such large sums of money given his financial and job records”. Rather, a more plausible deduction would be that the cash found on the appellant was payment for him to act as a courier for the five bundles. If this deduction were correct, then the appellant’s claim that he did not know what the five bundles contained would, in light of the large sum of money involved, be rendered a lot more difficult to believe. For the element of “possession” (within the meaning of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act) to be established, it must not only be shown that the accused had physical control of the drugs at the relevant time; the Prosecution must also prove that the accused possessed the requisite knowledge as to the contents of what he was carrying: see Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 2 AC 256; Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311. In the course of the appeal before us, counsel for the appellant relied heavily on the fact that the contents of the bundles were securely wrapped in newspapers and could not be identified. We were accordingly invited to draw the inference that the appellant had no knowledge of the contents of the bundles. Consequently, Choo JC held that the charge against the appellant had been made out. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to suffer the death penalty.\n",

      " It seemed to us clear that on the basis of statements C, D and E, the movements of Malik at Block 109 that fateful afternoon, and the confessions of Norazmi which unequivocally implicated Malik (which statements were admissible against Malik under s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed), as interpreted by this court in Chin Seow Noi v PP [1993] 3 SLR(R) 566), there was ample evidence to warrant the trial judge finding that it was Malik who placed the plastic bag with the drugs beside the abandoned washing machine on the ninth floor and that he was thus in possession of the drugs. Possession having been proven, he was presumed under s 17 to have the drugs for the purposes of trafficking. The charge was therefore established. In the premises, the findings and the verdict recorded by the trial judge were correct and should be upheld and which we did. In this appeal, besides reiterating the point that statement B (second part) and statements C and D should not have been admitted into evidence on the ground that they were not made voluntarily, and which we have dealt with above, what counsel for Malik basically argued was that the version of events as recounted by Malik in court was credible, or, at the very least, he had raised a reasonable doubt, particularly in the light of the fact that Norazmi had admitted at the trial that all the drugs belonged to him and that Malik had no connection with drugs. Norazmi also confirmed that he did borrow money from Malik for gambling. In the result, we agreed with the finding of the trial judge that the cautioned statement was admissible. Malik had failed to raise any reasonable doubt in relation to both the objective and subjective requirements in order to successfully plead that the statement was not given voluntarily. The appellant, Abdul Malik bin Abdul Jamil (“Malik”) was tried and convicted of the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug, namely, that he had on 31 January 2001, in his possession for the purpose of trafficking not less than 31.91g of diamorphine, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1998 Ed) and punishable under s 33 of the Act.

      " As the appellants were not able to establish that the trial judge erred in convicting them, their appeals were dismissed. As far as Syed’s statements to the CNB are concerned, it ought to be reiterated that an accused person’s confession, though retracted, can be used against a co-accused so long as the court is satisfied after taking into account the explanation given for the retraction, that the confession is true and that it was made voluntarily. This was made clear by this court in PP v Rozman bin Jusoh [1995] 2 SLR(R) 879 and Panya Martmontree v PP [1995] 2 SLR(R) 806. Needless to say, there is a question as to the proper weight to be ascribed to the statement of one accused who implicates the co-accused. We are satisfied that the trial judge gave this question sufficient attention and see no reason to disagree with his conclusion. The other arguments advanced by the appellants against their conviction also lacked merit. Syed asserted that the trial judge failed to direct himself sufficiently on the issue of common intention under s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). We were satisfied that the trial judge, who relied on, inter alia, the decision of this court in Foong Seow Ngui v PP [1995] 3 SLR(R) 254 and other cases, including Mahbub Shah v King-Emperor (1945) 47 Bom LR 941 and Barendra Kumar Ghosh v Emperor AIR 1925 PC 1, carefully considered the applicable principles and case law on common intention. The judge was clearly right when he concluded that, on the basis of the finding that Syed and Roetikno handled and repacked the drugs in Room 406 of Taipei Hotel at the material time, they were in possession of the drugs in furtherance of the common intention to traffic in them. The admissions made by Syed and Roetikno in their statements to the CNB were undoubtedly confessions of their guilt. In innumerable cases, including Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP [1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 and Anandagoda v R [1962] MLJ 289, it was made clear that the test as to whether or not a statement is a confession is an objective one. It depends on whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstances in which it was made, it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or suggest the inference that he committed the offence (per Lord Guest in Anandagoda (supra at 291). An accused person who retracts during his trial a confession he made earlier on can still be convicted on the basis of the confession if the court is satisfied that it was made voluntarily and that it was true.

      " For the reasons we have given, we agreed with the findings of the judicial commissioner that the Prosecution had proven the guilt of both appellants beyond a reasonable doubt. His conclusions could not be impugned. In our view both the appellants were knowing and willing participants in the crimes for which they were charged. Consequently, we dismissed their appeals. Despite Steven Ang’s attempts to exonerate Lim we found no reason to disturb the inferences drawn and conclusions reached by the trial judge in the present case. It was not denied by the defence that Steven Ang was a known drug peddler and that there was extensive communication between Lim and Steven Ang on 26 June 2001.

      " We were of the view that Tay J was correct to have convicted the appellant. Firstly, the Prosecution had proved that the appellant had in his possession and control the keys to the flat and to the rented room. Thus, s 18(1)(c) of the MDA applied and the appellant was presumed to have had the drugs in his possession. Secondly, because he was presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession, s 18 (2) of the MDA applied. Thus, he was then presumed to have known the nature of the drugs (ie cannabis). Thirdly, the Prosecution proved that the drugs in the appellant’s possession were meant for the purposes of trafficking. The sheer quantity of the drugs (not less than 2,715.6g of cannabis) and the drug trafficking paraphernalia found in the flat went to prove that the drugs were meant for the purposes of trafficking. Fourthly, as regards s 5(1)(a) of the MDA, the trafficking of the drugs was not authorised. Fifthly, by virtue of s 5(2) of the MDA, the appellant had committed the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug since he had in his possession that drug (ie the cannabis) for the purpose of trafficking. Lastly, s 33 of the MDA, in conjunction with the Second Schedule, provides that where the quantity of cannabis being trafficked without authorisation is more than 500g, the punishment shall be death. Because the appellant and Bala were acting in concert in possessing the cannabis for the purpose of trafficking, s 34 of the Penal Code was correctly applied. For the reasons above we dismissed the appeal. On a strict interpretation of the section, there is no requirement that the Prosecution need prove when the drugs were put in the room or relevant premises. However, we would stress that, where the Prosecution has the evidence to prove the timing of the installation of the drugs, it should, as a matter of sound practice, adduce that evidence at trial. Section 18(1)(c) is the first presumption, followed by s 18(2), and thus must be invoked with circumspection and care. We were of the opinion that on the facts of this case, the Prosecution had proven its case sufficiently. In this regard, the evidence of Indra was crucial. Had there been no independent witness, no direct evidence of the key on the appellant’s person and no evidence as to when, no matter how rough an estimate, the drugs were put in the room, the Prosecution might not have discharged its s 18(1)(c) burden. The s 18(1)(c) gate in the MDA must be appropriately guarded. We were convinced that s 18(1)(c) was applied correctly in this case. What s 18(1)(c) does is to impose a presumption on a keyholder. Thus, the circumstantial evidence led “inevitably and inexorably to one conclusion and one conclusion only”: that for the purposes of s 18(1)(c), which was the first of the seven steps to conviction, the appellant was in possession and control of the keys to the flat and the said room. There was no other permutation of the evidence to persuade us that the appellant was not in possession and control of the relevant keys. For these reasons, we were convinced that Tay J had correctly found that the presumption under s 18(1)(c) applied. The appellant argued that it was in fact Bala who rented the room from Indra. The objective behind such an argument was to distance the appellant from the room and therefore from the drugs found therein. This argument lacked merit. It was clear that it was the appellant who negotiated the agreement for the rented room. Indra, a witness who had no reason to lie, testified that the appellant played the leading role in securing the room for rent. The following evidence from the verbatim notes illustrated this point.

      " Accordingly, for the reasons given above, we dismissed the appeal.

Although there was an error as to the correct application of the presumptions under ss 18 and 17 of the MDA in the decision by the trial judge, there was, as stated by the trial judge, overwhelming evidence to conclude that Teo was in possession of the drugs seized for the purposes of trafficking in them. Having reviewed the evidence in its totality, we too were satisfied that there was ample evidence to find Teo guilty of the charge against him, without resorting to any of the presumptions under ss 18 and 17 of the MDA. The finding by the trial judge that Teo was fully aware of the penalty he was facing was based on evidence before him and we saw no reason to disturb this. In any event, it was clear from the records that the charge and the notice of warning in due form, as prescribed under s 122 (6) of the CPC, were served on the accused. The charge ended with the words, “you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the [MDA] and punishable under Section 33 of the [MDA]”. The records also showed that the accused had confirmed by appending his signature to the charge that the nature and consequence of the charge was explained to him in Hokkien by an interpreter. In the circumstances, the contention that the punishment of death penalty was not brought to the attention of the accused was without merit.\n",

As such, they will not be traversed again, save only to restate that the Privy Council in Reyes v The Queen did not pronounce mandatory death sentences absolutely unconstitutional, and to make the further point that their Lordships did allow that there might be circumstances in which the mandatory death sentence could be “sufficiently discriminating to obviate any inhumanity in its operation”. We agree with the trial judge’s reasoning on the effect of a conflict between a customary international law rule and a domestic statute. The trial judge held that even if there was a customary international law rule prohibiting execution by hanging, the domestic statute providing for such punishment, viz, the MDA, would prevail in the event of inconsistency. The trial judge cited Chung Chi Cheung v The King [1939] AC 160 and Collco Dealings Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1962] AC 1 in support of this proposition. The appellant’s submissions are therefore rejected. However, we are of the view that the mandatory death sentence prescribed under the MDA is sufficiently discriminating to obviate any inhumanity in its operation. It is therefore constitutional.\n",

      " The statutory presumption under s 17 being a presumption in respect of trafficking with the possibility that the death penalty might be imposed, must be read strictly. It is a provision to facilitate the application of s 5(2), whereas s 18 concerned presumptions in respect of the possession of controlled drugs, which (possession) is another principal (though not capital) offence under the Act. The Legislature would have made it clear had it wanted s 5(2) to be further reinforced by means of s 18(2). In the absence of such an express intention, we think it best to keep the presumptions under s 18 separate from that in s 17, as has always been the case. A person who is to be condemned to death under this Act must at least be proven to know that he had controlled drugs in his possession. For the reasons above, the appeals were dismissed. The court stopped there, but for reasons set out above, we now extend and hold that it could not have been the Legislature’s intention to have a crossover application of the presumptions under ss 17 and 18(2). Section 18(2) was a logical and direct complement to s 18(1); it is not an auxiliary provision to s 17. The phrase “proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession” in s 18(2) has a perfectly logical sense in the structure of the Act and in its proper place within s 18. That section provides the statutory presumptions of possession and knowledge of the nature of the controlled drugs found in any container where the drugs were not obvious to view. It clearly needed to apply to situations where the drugs were found in the possession of a person and were not obvious to view, in which event, it would be open to the trial judge to find as a fact that those drugs have been proven to be in the physical possession of that person. Hence, the phrase “proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession” in s 18(2) shifts the burden of proof to that person to show that he did not know the nature of the drugs and it may, therefore, not be sufficient for him to say merely, that he did not know that the drugs found in his room were in fact drugs. He will have to persuade the judge that he truly did not know. If he fails to rebut the s 18 presumptions he would be liable to a conviction for possession, unless an act of trafficking, as defined in s 2, is proved against him, in which event, he would be liable to a conviction for trafficking. If, a person is proved to know (as opposed to presumed to know) the nature of the drugs in his possession, then the presumption under s 17 applies and he would be liable to a conviction for trafficking even though he did not commit any act constituting the act of trafficking defined in s 2. The accused in Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP failed to persuade the trial judge that he was carrying counterfeit money in the white plastic bag and was convicted. The conviction was upheld by this court which also held that the application of s 17 was inappropriate where the presumptions under s 18 and an act constituting trafficking under s 2 had been proved, as was the case there. The presumption in s 17 applies only in situations where a person is, in the words of this court in Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP [1995] 3 SLR(R) 689, “proved” to be in possession of controlled drugs, but apart from mere possession, had not done any of the acts constituting trafficking as set out in s 2. It is contrary to the principles of statutory interpretation, and even more so, the interpretation of a criminal statute, especially one in which the death penalty is involved, to combine presumptions from two sections in an Act each serving a different function – in this case, shifting the burden of proof in one with regard to possession and the other, in regard to trafficking. Possession and trafficking are distinct offences under the Act, although possession may lead to the more serious charge of trafficking, while, trafficking itself might conceivably be committed without actual possession. The danger of mixing the s 17 and s 18 presumptions was anticipated by this court in some of its previous decisions which were not brought to the attention of the trial judge below because this was not an issue before him. The decision of this court in Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP expressed the view that for the s 17 presumption to apply, it must first be proved that the accused knew that he was in possession of the drugs.

      " For the reasons above, we dismissed both appeals. The appeals before us were entirely against findings of fact. The law presumes that a person caught in possession of prohibited drugs knows that he is in possession of such drugs, with the burden of rebutting that presumption on the person charged – what Lord Pearce would describe as “an improvement of a difficult position”: see Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 2 AC 256 at 307. Rebutting the statutory presumption is a matter of fact, and is no different from any other fact-finding exercise save that the law requires that a person rebutting a statutory presumption does so on a balance of probabilities. It is not sufficient for him merely to raise a reasonable doubt. In the present instance, the first appellant testified that he thought that he was carrying chocolates, later correcting his evidence to African herbs (that tasted like chocolate). This brought his case within the kind discussed in Shan Kai Weng v PP [2004] 1 SLR(R) 57, Tan Ah Tee v PP [1979–1980] SLR(R) 311, and the statement from Ubaka Chris Chinenye v PP cited in all the cases above as well as by the trial judge in the present case: “[I]gnorance is a defence only when there is no reason for suspicion and no right and opportunity of examination ...”. It was sufficiently clear to us, from the trial judge’s grounds of decision, that the court did not believe the explanation of the first appellant, and was thus not persuaded that he had rebutted the statutory presumption. It was a finding that the court was entitled to make on the totality of the evidence before it. The trial judge did not need to refer to thinly speculative evidence so long as it appeared clear that he had taken all the relevant and material evidence into account in making his finding. However, the word “abetment” in its ordinary sense and usage includes instigation, conspiracy, and aiding. Thus, we are of the view that the penal provision in the Act must be given the same meaning as that in the Penal Code. It would be more precise if the word “conspiracy” in the charge against the second appellant was replaced by “abetment” in conformity with the word used in s 12 of the Act. In the event, it made no material difference to the defence. The trial judge had not only found sufficient evidence connecting the second appellant to Smith and the first appellant, he had also found that the second appellant was connected with the name “Marshal”. He disbelieved the second appellant’s evidence that the initials “M.N.” written on the telephone book in his possession stood for “Malachy Nelson”, his name; or that the “Marshal” written on his laundry receipt referred to one “Joseph Marshal”. The court was satisfied “beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an arrangement between Smith and the two [appellants] for the second [appellant] to come to Singapore to collect the capsules from the first [appellant]” (at [61]). Accordingly, the second appellant was also convicted as charged. We were satisfied that on the evidence as found by the trial judge, including his rejection of the second appellant’s explanations, the court was entitled to find that there was no reasonable doubt that the second appellant was engaged in a conspiracy with the first appellant and Smith as charged. The next issue was whether an act of importing the drugs within the meaning of s 7 of the Act had been proved. There is no special definition of the words in s 7 which are clear and obvious: “Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person to import into or export from Singapore a controlled drug.” The evidence that was not disputed, and in our view, adequately proved, was that the first appellant had entered Singapore at the Changi International Airport with the sling bag and had not left the transit area of the airport from the time he arrived until he was arrested. There was no dispute that bringing the bag (and thus the drugs) into Singapore was an act of importing the drugs within the meaning of s 7. The first appellant proceeded with his defence on the basis that he came into Singapore with the bag containing the drugs. The trial judge thus had no difficulty finding that the act of importing the drugs was proved beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly, found the first appellant guilty as charged and convicted him.\n",
