Second, if a person is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession he shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug: s 18(2) of the MDA. Third, upon proof of possession of an amount of the controlled drug in excess of a certain stipulated quantity it shall be presumed, unless it is proved to the contrary, that the possession was for the purposes of trafficking: s 17 of the MDA.
