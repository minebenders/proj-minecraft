      "On 6 September 1999 the appellant, together with another Wan Yue Kong (“Wan”), was convicted and sentenced to death by Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh (“the trial judge”) under a joint charge of drug trafficking. He appealed against his conviction and sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons. We should add that Wan did not file any appeal.The trial judge after hearing the rebuttal evidence from the Prosecution witnesses involved in the taking of the statements and analysing the same in the light of the evidence adduced by the appellant’s witnesses, ruled that the two statements “appeared to (have been) made as a result of inducement uttered and emanating from the investigating officer, the inducement being that if (the appellant) gave a satisfactory statement he would be allowed to see his family”. Accordingly, he held that the Prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the two statements were voluntarily made and refused to admit the same.At the conclusion of the trial and after hearing the appellant’s oral evidence as well as the arguments of the Prosecution and the Defence, the trial judge accepted the statements made by Wan as an accurate reflection of what took place between Wan and the appellant on 2 March 1999, between 3.50pm to 3.55pm, at the ground floor lift landing of Block 106, Jalan Bukit Merah. The appellant’s defence was rejected by the trial judge as being “so incredible that it was incapable of belief”. The trial judge relied on the direct evidence given by the CNB surveillance officers, the confessions made by Wan and all the “tightly knit strands of circumstantial evidence” to reach the irresistible conclusion that the red plastic bag which the appellant had passed to Wan contained the packets of diamorphine which Wan had confessed to receiving. The trial judge therefore convicted the appellant and Wan under the amended joint charge and sentenced them to suffer death.\n",

      "On the other hand, the Judge found that the Prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Rusli had knowledge of the nature of the drugs that were contained in both the packets. Rusli had maintained, and this was supported by Andi’s evidence, that he only ever dealt with one bundle because of the risk of capital punishment. The Judge amended the charge against Rusli to one of instigating Andi to traffic in not less than 14.46g of diamorphine (being the amount of diamorphine in one packet of drugs) and convicted him accordingly. Rusli was sentenced to 27.5 years’ imprisonment for this charge. The Prosecution also proceeded on two other charges against Rusli, to which he pled guilty (see [1(b)] above): an enhanced possession charge and a consumption charge. The Judge imposed a sentence of 2.5 years’ and 12 months’ imprisonment for these respective offences. He ordered the first two sentences to run consecutively and the last concurrently, resulting in an aggregate term of imprisonment of 30 years.Akebal’s defence in the court below was that he had been incorrectly identified, by CNB officers and Andi, as the man who placed the orange bag in Andi’s car. The High Court judge (“the Judge”) rejected this defence. He was satisfied that the evidence identifying Akebal was of a good quality. As a result, the presumptions under ss 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the MDA were triggered: Akebal was presumed to have had the drugs in his possession and to have known the nature of the drugs. Since Akebal did not adduce any evidence to rebut the presumptions, and since in delivering the drugs he had plainly trafficked, the Judge convicted him on the capital charge. Akebal was not issued a certificate of substantive assistance and the Judge passed the sentence of death accordingly.Mr Jayaratnam also noted that the appellant is not eligible for caning. This is another factor that the court may take into account in adjusting the prison sentence. The appellant also faced a number of other charges that he consented to being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. This too is a factor that the court may have regard to in enhancing the sentence (Re Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh [2019] 5 SLR 1037 at [48]–[49]). Finally, the appellant had a number of related antecedents. Taken together, it did not appear to be the case at all that the sentence imposed by the Judge was excessive, much less manifestly so. We therefore had no hesitation in dismissing the appeal against sentence.\n",

      "Technically and in so far as the last paragraph of the grounds of decision of the trial judges is concerned, the point made by counsel is valid. In a criminal trial there are two critical stages at which the court has to make a decision. Under s 189(1) of the CPC, at the close of the case for the Prosecution, the court has to decide whether the Prosecution has made out a case, which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction of the accused. In deciding this question or issue, the court ought not to consider whether the Prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Lord Diplock in Haw Tua Tau said, at [15]:The first appellant, Sim Ah Cheoh (“Sim”), a woman, was charged in the High Court under s 5(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”) with trafficking in a substantial quantity of drugs, namely, ten packets containing not less than 1,370.3g of diamorphine, on 26 April 1985 by transporting them from Hotel Negara at Claymore Drive to Changi Airport. The second and third appellants, Tan Chong Ngee Ronald (“Tan”) and Lim Joo Yin (“Lim”), were jointly charged under s 5(1) read with s 12 of the Act with abetting Sim in committing that offence. All three of them were tried jointly and were each found guilty of the charges and were convicted. Against the convictions, this appeal was brought, and at the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed it. We now give our reasons.Before us, counsel for the appellants mounted three main arguments in support of the appeal. First, it was argued by counsel for Sim, who advanced this argument on behalf of all the appellants, that the Prosecution had failed to prove an essential ingredient of the charge against Sim, namely, that Sim transported the drugs from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport (as described in the charge); that there was no evidence at all of such transportation, save for the statements recorded from the appellants, and that the finding of the trial judges that the ingredient of transportation had been established was based on an inference they drew and on the statements. It was not safe, so counsel submitted, to draw such inference of transportation, because there were competing rational inferences, and as for the statements they could not be relied upon as a foundation of the conviction of Sim. There was therefore a fatal gap or break in the evidence against Sim, and the charge against her had not been proved. In consequence, the charge against Tan and Lim for abetting Sim in trafficking in drugs could not stand.\n",

      "The trial judges accepted that both the appellants had come into Singapore only with a view to boarding a flight to Amsterdam the next day. They, however, rejected the submission made on behalf of the appellants that bringing drugs into Singapore with a view solely of exporting them would not be an offence under s 7 of the Act. They also rejected Ko’s defence that he did not know that what he was carrying was diamorphine. Accordingly, they convicted the appellants. Against the convictions, this appeal was brought. At the conclusion we dismissed it, and we now give our reasons.Ground (a) can be disposed of very briefly. By s 18(2) of the Act a rebuttable presumption arose that Ko knew the nature of the drug that he was carrying. Once the presumption arose, the onus of discharging it was on Ko. Having heard Ko’s defence, the trial judges were satisfied that he had not discharged the presumption. We have reviewed the record and it is clear that the trial judges were entitled on the evidence before them to arrive at this finding. We saw no reason to interfere.and submitted that s 7 was applicable only when it was sought to punish a master or captain who had contravened s 20. We could not accept that submission. In common with a number of other similar provisions in the Act, what s 20 does is to raise a presumption as to knowledge. By s 20, if it is proved that a drug was found in a ship or aircraft, then the presumption would arise that the drug was imported in the ship or aircraft with the knowledge of the master or captain. No doubt, in such a case, a master or captain may be charged for violating s 7 of the Act but that does not mean to say that s 7 is confined in its operations only to the master of a ship or captain of an aircraft used for the import of drugs. We see no reason why s 7 should not operate against (say) a passenger in a ship or aircraft who was importing drugs. Against such a passenger the presumption under s 20 as to knowledge would obviously not be applicable but (as in this case) the presumption under s 18(2) would apply.\n",

As a result, the presumptions under ss 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the MDA were triggered: Akebal was presumed to have had the drugs in his possession and to have known the nature of the drugs. Since Akebal did not adduce any evidence to rebut the presumptions, and since in delivering the drugs he had plainly trafficked, the Judge convicted him on the capital charge. Akebal was not issued a certificate of substantive assistance and the Judge passed the sentence of death accordingly.Mr Jayaratnam also noted that the appellant is not eligible for caning. This is another factor that the court may take into account in adjusting the prison sentence. The appellant also faced a number of other charges that he consented to being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. This too is a factor that the court may have regard to in enhancing the sentence (Re Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh [2019] 5 SLR 1037 at [48]–[49]). Finally, the appellant had a number of related antecedents. Taken together, it did not appear to be the case at all that the sentence imposed by the Judge was excessive, much less manifestly so. We therefore had no hesitation in dismissing the appeal against sentence.',\n",
