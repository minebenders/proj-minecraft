      "On 6 September 1999 the appellant, together with another Wan Yue Kong (“Wan”), was convicted and sentenced to death by Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh (“the trial judge”) under a joint charge of drug trafficking. He appealed against his conviction and sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons. We should add that Wan did not file any appeal.Both the appellant and Wan were jointly tried in the same court. At the close of the Prosecution’s case the court allowed the Prosecution’s application that the capital charges against the two accused be amended to a joint capital charge. In allowing the amendment, the trial judge permitted counsel to further cross-examine any of the Prosecution’s witnesses if they so wished. Counsel for the appellant did avail himself of this opportunity.In the meantime, Wan returned to the coffee shop. After finishing his food, he told Chong that he was leaving for Tiong Bahru Plaza. Chong agreed to follow Wan. Both walked towards Block 106 and Wan contacted Bee Lian to ask her to come down. The three of them then took a taxi to Tiong Bahru Plaza. As they were about to alight from the taxi at the destination, they were arrested by CNB officers. They were then taken back to Block 106, Jalan Bukit Merah, unit #06-1846. This unit (rented from HDB) belonged to Wan’s uncle, one Mark Siak Kong, who had allowed Wan to use it. A search was done outside the unit and two keys were found at a ventilation opening and with the two keys the officers opened the metal grill and wooden door of the unit.\n",

The High Court judge (“the Judge”) rejected this defence. He was satisfied that the evidence identifying Akebal was of a good quality. As a result, the presumptions under ss 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the MDA were triggered: Akebal was presumed to have had the drugs in his possession and to have known the nature of the drugs. Since Akebal did not adduce any evidence to rebut the presumptions, and since in delivering the drugs he had plainly trafficked, the Judge convicted him on the capital charge. Akebal was not issued a certificate of substantive assistance and the Judge passed the sentence of death accordingly.Taking these pieces of evidence together, we are amply satisfied that it was Akebal that handed the bag to Andi. That would mean that he had actual possession of the bag with the drugs, that he handed it to Andi and so engaged in the act of trafficking. The Prosecution is entitled to invoke the presumption of knowledge, which has not been rebutted. Akebal’s appeal is therefore without merit and accordingly dismissed.Mr Jayaratnam also noted that the appellant is not eligible for caning.

      "The first appellant, Sim Ah Cheoh (“Sim”), a woman, was charged in the High Court under s 5(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”) with trafficking in a substantial quantity of drugs, namely, ten packets containing not less than 1,370.3g of diamorphine, on 26 April 1985 by transporting them from Hotel Negara at Claymore Drive to Changi Airport. The second and third appellants, Tan Chong Ngee Ronald (“Tan”) and Lim Joo Yin (“Lim”), were jointly charged under s 5(1) read with s 12 of the Act with abetting Sim in committing that offence. All three of them were tried jointly and were each found guilty of the charges and were convicted. Against the convictions, this appeal was brought, and at the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed it. We now give our reasons.At the close of the case for the Prosecution, counsel for the appellants respectively submitted that no case had been made out against the appellants, which, if unrebutted, would warrant their convictions on the charges against them. These arguments were rejected by the trial judges who held that a case had been made out and called upon the appellants to enter upon their defence. Each of the appellants elected not to give evidence or to call any evidence in their defence. The trial judges held that in the circumstances they “had no alternative but to convict all three accused as charged”.These cases are undoubted authorities on the construction and application of s 30 of the Evidence Act and we respectfully agree with the views expressed in these decisions. However, on the evidence before us, this argument on behalf of the appellants must fail. We revert again, very briefly, to the statements made by the appellants respectively. Sim’s statement was evidence against herself as to possession of the heroin and of the preparatory steps taken to carry them to the United States. Tan’s statement was evidence against (a) Sim as to possession and transportation of the heroin by Sim from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport; and (b) himself as to abetting Sim in strapping the heroin to her person and in transporting them. Lim’s statement was evidence against himself as to possession of the heroin and abetting Sim in strapping the heroin to her person with a view to transporting them. These statements were not the only evidence against Sim as to transportation of the heroin. There was a preponderance of other evidence against Sim on that point. As we have demonstrated, there were primary facts which had been established by direct evidence and which, in our view, led inescapably to the inference that she carried the heroin from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport. Accordingly, in our judgment, these statements were not the foundation of the conviction of Sim of the offence with which she was charged. They “lent assurance to the other evidence”. In so far as the convictions of Tan and Lim are concerned their statements as against them respectively were evidence of the parts they played respectively in assisting Sim in the transportation of the heroin and can be relied upon. Again, there was also other evidence that they assisted Sim. We accordingly rejected the first argument submitted on behalf of the appellants.\n",

      "The thrust of the contentions by counsel for the appellants in the court below was that they had not committed either the actus reus or the mens rea of “importing” drugs into Singapore. The contentions were dismissed by the learned trial judges who held that the word “import” in s 7 of the Act should be given the meaning ascribed to the word by s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) and they rejected the contention that the word “import” in the Act should be given a more restrictive meaning (see PP v Ng Kwok Chun [1992] 1 SLR(R) 159). The learned trial judges said at [22]–[23]:This appeal raised a short but significant point of law, namely, whether a person imports into Singapore a controlled drug, contrary to s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”) when he brings it into Singapore whilst he is in transit at the airport. We dismissed the appeal at the end of the hearing and we now give our reasons.It is accordingly necessary to examine the decision in Ko Mun Cheung ([8] supra) in detail. The accused in that case were arrested after they had left the arrival and transit area of the airport and were preparing to enter Singapore. They had only intended to remain in Singapore overnight and were to catch a flight to Amsterdam the next day. The drugs that they carried with them were intended for Amsterdam and not Singapore. It was argued that these facts showed that they had not imported the drugs into Singapore contrary to s 7 of the Act but had only contravened s 5 of the Act by being in possession of drugs. At first instance, Chan Sek Keong and Yong Pung How JJ (as they then were) rejected the argument. Reliance was placed on the Canadian decision in R v Geesman (1970) 13 CRNS 240 as Canada had, like Singapore, ratified the United Nations’ Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961. In Geesman, the court held that the word “import” bore its ordinary meaning, ie “to bring or cause to be brought in something from a foreign country”. The learned trial judges in Ko Mun Cheung fortified their reasoning by applying the definition of “import” contained in s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) which reads:\n",

      "There is no basis for us to disturb the findings of the trial judges except to say that they made a mistake when they referred to “white powdery substance”. But it seems to us that the court below could not have been unaware that the substance strapped onto Cheuk’s person was in solid form. In fact towards the end of the trial, when Cheuk was giving evidence, the court even wanted a demonstration done to show how the substance, in blocks, was strapped to her body. This was abandoned when the deputy public prosecutor informed the court that the substance had become powdery as a result of scientific examination. This reference to “powdery substance” was probably an error made while writing out the grounds of decision. But even if one were to assume that the learned trial judges had in fact wrongly perceived the situation, thinking that the substance was in powdery form when it was in solid form, this court has still to ask the question whether Cheuk’s explanation that she thought the blocks contained gold jewellery was credible. The blocks are shown in photographs which were tendered in the court below. She said she thought it was not an offence to carry gold jewellery. Yet she allowed herself to be strapped up in great discomfort which she had to endure for the entire journey to Amsterdam, without asking a single question of those people who were strapping her with those solid blocks. She did not even protest. She did not ask her travelling companion, Tse, about the blocks either. When she was giving her s 122(6) statement, she did not say that she thought the solid blocks contained gold jewellery. Neither did she say that when she was questioned at the airport after being arrested. She merely said that she did not know what she was carrying. In our opinion the trial judges were correct not to have accepted her story – it is just too incredible. We would further add that having reviewed her evidence in court, we find that she was evasive on many crucial aspects.Another point raised by Cheuk is that the trial judges should not have allowed a joint trial as it has in this case occasioned a miscarriage of justice. Section 176 of the Criminal Procedure Code permits a joint trial where more than one person is accused of the same offence or of different offences in the same transaction. Her counsel submitted that Tse and Cheuk were not charged for the same offence nor were the offences committed in the same transaction. He submitted that though the accused did not object to the joint trial it was no less a nullity. He said that the joint trial prejudiced Cheuk in two ways. First, the unfavourable view which the trial judges took of Tse’s case would have adversely affected hers. Second, since Tse chose to remain silent, Cheuk could not compel Tse to give evidence which would support her case.Next is the question of prejudice. The first complaint is that the judges’ view of Cheuk’s case was likely to be affected by their unfavourable view of Tse’s case. As we said earlier, the trial judges rejected Cheuk’s evidence that she did not know what she was carrying and that she did not know that she was transiting in Singapore. As can be seen, the trial judges approached the matter by evaluating her evidence on the basis of whether it was inherently believable. It is difficult to see how any unfavourable view they might have formed of Tse’s case could have affected their evaluation of Cheuk’s case.\n",

The Public Prosecutor appealed against her acquittal and at the end of the hearing before us, we dismissed the appeal for the reasons which follow.We would record our grave doubts over the correctness of the appellant’s actions in the days after the respondent’s acquittal below. However, in view of our decision to dismiss the appeal, and in the absence of full argument on the nature and extent of the court’s inherent jurisdiction over its criminal procedure, we would decline to express any definitive view on Mr Sant Singh’s contentions although we are of the preliminary view that such a power to stay criminal proceedings in circumstances where it can be shown that the accused could not have a fair trial exists.Before we leave this judgment, we should comment on the events which occurred after the respondent’s acquittal on 1 September 1992. On that evening, the respondent’s solicitors received a telefax from the appellant asking that the respondent remain in Singapore as she might be needed as a rebuttal witness for the Prosecution in its case against Wong. On 2 September 1992, after receiving legal advice, she agreed to co-operate with the Prosecution and was interviewed by the CNB later that day. She was released by the CNB that evening but was rearrested the following evening after a notice of appeal was filed against the decision of the learned judicial commissioner. We should say that no allegation of mala fides has been levelled at the appellant and the learned DPP clarified that the interviewing of the respondent before a final decision was taken on whether to appeal against the decision below was due to miscommunication in the appellant’s chambers.\n",

      "The appellant, a Hong Kong citizen, was charged with importing into Singapore on 21 November 1990 2,718g of diamorphine, an offence under s 7 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1985 Rev Ed). At trial he was found guilty of the charge and sentenced to death. He appealed against his conviction. Following a hearing we dismissed the appeal and we now give our reasons.Having reviewed the evidence before him, the learned judicial commissioner held that there was “no threat issued that could reasonably cause the apprehension of instant death” to the appellant, as required by s 94 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). The appellant claimed that Ah Weng had threatened to kill him but there was no evidence to show that Ah Weng had been armed or had otherwise possessed the means to carry out his threats with immediacy. Despite his claims as to the terror he felt while on the plane and in the airport, he failed similarly to show that he had indeed been in any immediate danger during that period of time, particularly in view of the fact that there had been no one holding him hostage during that time. Furthermore he did not state that he had at any time been in fear of instant death. Therefore, even if his evidence about Ah Weng’s threats were to be accepted, the defence of duress would not stand. As it was, the learned judicial commissioner expressed grave reservations about the appellant’s evidence. The appellant described Ah Weng as a “colleague” and a “better-than-normal friend”; yet, when asked, he said he did not know Ah Weng’s telephone number, his address or even his full name. Also, in spite of his professed terror at the threats of violence allegedly made by Ah Weng, he had said nothing at all about these threats when speaking to Koh. The learned judicial commissioner went on to state that, on the other hand, he had found Koh’s evidence as regards the interrogation and the pocket book entries to be “honest and accurate, if not perfect accounts of the interrogation”. The appellant’s defence of duress was consequently rejected.We were also of the view that in any case the learned judicial commissioner did not actually rely on the evidence of Koh’s pocket book entries in coming to his decision. Although he set out the contents of the pocket book entries in his judgment, this was done as part of the process of setting out the relevant background to the case. He referred to Koh’s evidence again when rejecting the appellant’s defence of duress but this reference was made after he had examined the evidence given by the appellant in court and found that on the basis of the appellant’s own evidence, the defence of duress was not made out. Indeed, the reference to Koh’s pocket book entries was somewhat perfunctory since by that stage it was eminently clear that, in dismissing the defence of duress, it would be unnecessary to rely on the evidence of the pocket book entries. We were of the view therefore that the admission of Koh’s pocket book entries as evidence did not occasion the appellant such prejudice as to deprive him of a fair trial.\n",

      "At the end of the trial, the trial judge acquitted the respondent of the charge. The Public Prosecutor appealed against the respondent’s acquittal and at the end of the appeal, we allowed the appeal, convicted the respondent of the charge and sentenced the respondent to death. We now state our reasons for so doing.Lord Russell, in delivering the judgment of the Board, rejected that argument and said that there was no limitation on the power of the appellate court unless it was expressly set out in the Code (which it was not) and laid down four guidelines for an appellate court to consider before reaching its conclusions upon fact. They were:\n",
      "(a)     the views of the trial judge as to the credibility of the witnesses;\n",
      "(b)     the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he had been acquitted at his trial;\n",
      "(c)     the right of the accused to the benefit of the doubt; and\n",
      "(d)     the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact by the trial judge who had the advantage of seeing the witness.The trial judge nonetheless went on to consider the other evidence in his favour. He found that his evidence that he was asked to come down by Yeo on 13 May 1991 was unchallenged. The respondent did not know Lai except as Yeo’s friend and he had not seen Tee or Ah Hai before. There was no suggestion that the contents of the bags were visible or that the respondent had looked inside them or that he had reason to be suspicious about them. He kept out of all the discussions, and there was no evidence to show that when he remained behind at Lorong 22 he knew that someone was coming to collect his car key from him to gain access to the bags. The trial judge found that the respondent had succeeded in rebutting the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the Act, and following this that a reasonable doubt had arisen as to whether he was engaged in a conspiracy to traffic drugs with the others. Accordingly he acquitted him.\n",

      "The trial judge rejected the defences of all the three appellants. With regard to Kong, the trial judge held that on the evidence of Tan and Yeap, Kong was involved more deeply in the matter than he admitted. The evidence of Tan and Yeap showed that he was actively engaged in arranging for the delivery of the car to Mandarin Hotel where he assumed possession of it by taking over the key to the car. The trial judge accepted the evidence adduced by the Prosecution that he admitted to SNO Peter Lim and NO Ng that there was diamorphine in the car. The trial judge in conclusion said:We now turn to the first main argument. The first oral statement was said to have been made by Kong to SNO Peter Lim in his office in CNB with NO Ng acting as the Mandarin interpreter. Counsel submitted that evidence adduced to prove that the statement was made was wholly unsatisfactory and should not have been accepted by the trial judge. Firstly, NO Ng was the arresting officer and should not have acted as the interpreter and a wholly independent person against whom no allegation of bias could be made should have acted as the interpreter: R v Mitchell [1970] Crim LR 153 and Cheong See Leong v PP (1949) 15 MLJ 67; (1948–49) MLJ Supp 56. This argument has no merit. SNO Peter Lim was at that time investigating a serious offence and it was clearly in order for him to interview Kong with the help of NO Ng as the interpreter in Mandarin. There is no principle of law which requires that on such occasion an interpreter not involved in the investigation should be called upon to interpret. There is no allegation of bias against either SNO Peter Lim or NO Ng, and we cannot see any objection in NO Ng acting as the Mandarin interpreter for SNO Peter Lim in such an interview. The case of R v Mitchell is wholly irrelevant. There, at the trial, the judge allowed a waiter of the restaurant, the proprietor of which had complained against the accused, to act as the interpreter and it was held that such act amounted to an irregularity of such a character as to make it unsafe in the circumstances to let the conviction stand. In Cheong See Leong the accused was convicted of an offence under the emergency regulations. At the trial evidence was given of a statement of the accused alleged to have been made to the inspector through the interpretation of a detective sergeant who was a member of the investigation team. It was held that the use of the police sergeant as an interpreter who was fully conversant with the material facts and was subsequently called by the Prosecution offended against the elementary ideas of justice and therefore no reliance could be placed on the accuracy of the statement. This case was reported in a note form which is not at all adequate, and we are unable to ascertain precisely the reasoning for the decision. We are not persuaded that the principle laid down in Cheong See Leong is applicable on this occasion when SNO Peter Lim was interviewing or questioning Kong with the assistance of NO Ng acting as an interpreter.The third complaint by counsel is a major one and is directed to the evidence of SNO Peter Lim and NO Ng. In his evidence, SNO Peter Lim said that no note of the alleged statement had been made by him until 28 August 1989, ie more than six weeks later. Counsel for Kong submitted that in these circumstances, the note lacked the requirement of contemporaneity for the witness to have been allowed to refresh his memory, and accordingly, this evidence should have been disregarded by the trial judge. He also referred to the evidence of NO Ng that he made his notes of the interview on or about 22 August 1989. No credible explanation was given by either SNO Peter Lim or NO Ng for their failure to make any earlier a record of the alleged statement. Counsel went further and demonstrated that the evidence of SNO Lim and NO Ng were unsatisfactory in the following respects:\n",
      "(a)     SNO Lim claimed that it had not occurred to him to record the conversation at the time although he had the pen and paper in his office and he conceded that he should have written down the questions and answers and asked Kong to sign them.\n",
      "(b)     NO Ng conceded in cross-examination that he did not record the questions and answers because he had been asked to be an interpreter and had not been asked to reduce them into writing. He then gave an account of making notes of the interview on pieces of paper to rely on when he came to make his pocket book entry and this was some time after midnight on the day of arrest.\n",
      "(c)     Later on the same day on which the alleged confession was made, SNO Lim took Kong’s cautioned statement and that statement was wholly inconsistent with the earlier oral statement.\n",
      "(d)     Both SNO Lim and NO Ng admitted in cross-examination that various important matters alleged to have been said by Kong in his oral statement were not recorded in their pocket books and in particular, the vital matter of what Kong meant by “pai fen” and his statement that he meant “hai ro in” was not recorded.\n",
      "(e)     Both men had some pages in their pocket books available to record a note of the alleged interview at or soon after it had taken place, but neither did so. SNO Peter Lim waited until he obtained a new pocket book over a month later before making any note in his original pocket book and then made notes of the alleged interview in the new pocket book. NO Ng’s evidence was to the effect that he made some notes of the events at the end of his old pocket book about a week after the operations and that he made his remaining notes some three weeks after that when he obtained his new pocket book. NO Ng gave no explanation as to why he did not enter notes of the alleged interview in July in his first pocket book rather than waiting several weeks until he acquired his new pocket book.\n",
      "(f)     Lastly, neither of them gave any satisfactory or sensible explanation for the long delay in obtaining their pocket books.\n",

      "This is an appeal against the decision of S Rajendran J convicting the appellant of importing not less than 4,320g of diamorphine into Singapore under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”). After hearing arguments, we dismissed the appeal and indicated that we would give our reasons later, which we now do.The appellant was charged under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) for importing two packets of substance containing not less than 4,320g of diamorphine into Singapore. The appellant’s defence at the trial was that he did not know that diamorphine was concealed in the suitcase. He claimed that he was an innocent custodian of the suitcase and that he was carrying the bag from Bangkok to Athens as a favour for one John U Obiefuna (“Obiefuna”) who said it contained children’s clothes and clothes for his wife. The learned trial judge rejected the appellant’s defence that he did not know that diamorphine was concealed in the suitcase. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant. Against the conviction, this appeal was brought.The appellant’s reason for adducing additional evidence at this stage of the proceedings was that these documents were retained by the prison authorities despite his instructions that they be handed to his lawyer. Without expressing any opinion as regards the first condition of “non-availability”, we are of the view that the second and third conditions of “relevance” and “reliability” have not been met. Counsel for the appellant conceded that the additional evidence sought to be admitted had no bearing on the question of guilt or innocence of the appellant. The additional evidence was instead adduced for the rather tenuous reason that, had they been available at the trial, the trial judge’s impression of the appellant would have been different. The test of relevance is more stringent than that. We reiterate that the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case. As for the condition of “reliability”, we note that one of the certificates of guarantee was actually made out to “Mrs E Van Damme” and more significantly, was dated “26 September 1991”. Nowhere in the appellant’s testimony regarding his movements on 26 September 1991 did he mention visiting the jewellers. As for the business cards, there was absolutely no evidence as to when they might have been procured by the appellant. Accordingly, we found that there was no merit in the application and we dismissed the motion.\n",

He was duly sentenced to death. We heard his appeal against conviction on 15 August 1994 and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.The appellant arrived in Bangkok shortly after midnight on 26 June 1993. The appellant duly produced his Republic of Niger passport to the Thai immigration authorities and was given a social visit visa allowing him to remain in Thailand until 10 July 1993. He was not asked by the immigration authorities what type of visa he wanted, nor did he inform the authorities of the type of visa required. He claimed that he did not ask for a particular type of visa because he had been told by Joseph Udo that Mike Udo would use the Nigerian passport to get a working visa for him. Once the appellant had cleared Thai immigration and customs, he called Mike Udo. Mike Udo asked him to catch a taxi and to ask the driver to send him to the Noorie Hotel in the Patunamnoor area. The appellant did so and met Mike Udo in the lobby of the hotel. Once in Mike Udo’s room, Mike Udo told him that Joseph Udo had informed him of the appellant’s financial difficulties and asked for the appellant’s passports and air ticket to enable him to apply for a visa extension for the appellant and to get him a work permit. The appellant handed these over. Mike Udo said that a visa extension would take a few days to obtain and he promised to get the appellant a job. The job would involve packing cartons in the factory in which Mike Udo was working, and the appellant could expect to earn between US$400 to US$500 a month. The appellant was allowed to stay in Mike Udo’s hotel room in the interim.The appellant remained in the hotel room for two days after his arrival as he did not know his way around. At the end of this period, he confronted Mike Udo and asked him why he was being left idle in the hotel and when he would be allowed to work. Mike Udo asked him not to worry, and said that he would make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible. A week passed, and the appellant still had not been found work. He became angry with Mike Udo when told that there was no work and when Mike Udo told him that he (Mike Udo) would be returning to Nigeria. The appellant told Mike Udo that he wished to return to Nigeria also. Mike Udo agreed to make the necessary travel arrangements.\n",

The interpreter, however, did not translate the evidence of the witnesses to Kunnath who stated that he had not understood what any of the witnesses had said. He was convicted and sentenced to death. His appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal of Mauritius was dismissed as that court was of the view that, since neither Kunnath nor his counsel had demanded the right to a translation of the evidence, that right was “lost for all time”.

After hearing arguments by counsel, we dismissed the appeal and indicated that we would give our reasons later, which we now do.The trial judge rejected the appellant’s defence.

In addition, he held that the Prosecution had sufficiently established the mental element for the offence charged. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant. The parts of the trial judge’s grounds of decision material to the appeal will be detailed below.In our judgment, counsel for the appellant’s argument lacked merit. We observed that this contention could in fact be dismissed on the short ground that evidence unlawfully obtained, once relevant, is in law admissible, and the court would only exercise its judicial discretion to exclude it if its reception would operate unfairly against the accused: Cheng Swee Tiang v PP [1964] MLJ 291, following Kuruma, Son of Kaniu v R [1955] AC 197; [1995] 1 All ER 236 and Callis v Gunn [1963] 3 All ER 677. We did not think this principle of law to be in doubt, and, indeed, counsel did not seek to query it. We thought it useful, nonetheless, to deal with the legality of the questions asked by the customs officers in these grounds of judgment as it was argued fully before us. In our view, s 32 of the Act does not reserve the power to ask questions of suspects to CNB officers alone. Section 32 of the Act provides:\n",

      "The accused denied that the things found in the cupboard of his room in his home were his. He said they belonged to a Malaysian friend, David, who did not have a place to stay in Singapore and who used those things to make the sachets. In fact, the accused got the drugs from David. He said David thought that the accused had bought the drugs for resale and, in any case, David asked the accused to keep those things for him. This evidence was in direct contradiction of the evidence of SNO Bala who said that the accused admitted to SNO Bala that those things belonged to the accused. He explained that he did not challenge SNO Bala’s evidence because he was then not paying attention to what SNO Bala was saying. This explanation was rejected by the judicial commissioner, who found that the accused was attentive throughout the trial.We turn now to the third issue. In his written grounds of decision, the learned judicial commissioner set out at some length the various unsatisfactory aspects of the accused’s evidence. He found the testimony of the accused unworthy of belief and rejected them. He did not believe the accused’s defence that only one of the three bundles belonged to him and that the bundle was for his own consumption.We accept that the accused was a drug addict. The day after his arrest symptoms of drug withdrawal appeared. Dr Narajan Singh of Changi Prison Hospital examined the accused on 9 November 1991 and found him to be suffering from moderately severe drug withdrawal. But the fact that the accused was a drug addict did not mean that he could not also be a drug trafficker. In considering whether the accused had rebutted the presumption of trafficking on a balance of probabilities, the court was entitled to take into account all the evidence adduced from the accused in cross-examination and the evidence tendered by the Prosecution in rebuttal. Here, there was clear evidence that paraphernalia relating to trafficking in drugs – a weighing scale, a plastic spoon and a metal clip – were found in the accused’s room at his home. These things were stained with diamorphine. In the briefcase which he carried at the time of his arrest, there were 40 envelopes. His explanation as to why he bought the 40 envelopes is absurd as he himself admitted that when one purchases a Christmas card, an envelope would come with the card. He could easily and sensibly have listed the names of those people he wished to send Christmas cards to on a piece of paper. Why buy the envelopes? His explanation why he took the envelopes out of the wrapper is also strange. In this connection, the totality of the amount of diamorphine possessed by the accused at the time is pertinent – in the boot, in his briefcase and at his home. Also pertinent is the amount of money he was carrying, bearing in mind his alleged earnings and the fact that his mother also gave him money. Viewing all that, we are unable to accept the submission of the defence counsel that the learned judicial commissioner was wrong to have rejected the defence of consumption. In our view, the evidence points overwhelmingly to the fact that the accused was a trafficker and that the drugs in the car boot could not have been intended for his own consumption.\n",

We dismissed the appeals on 14 February 1994 and now give our reasons.Having heard the evidence in the case, the trial judge rejected the explanations proffered by both appellants. He accepted the Prosecution’s version of the events which had transpired on 23 and 24 May 1988, including the testimony of Fullett to the effect that there was “a meeting of minds between him and [the first appellant] for the sale of the drugs” at US$9,000 and that delivery of the drugs “was scheduled for the afternoon of 24 May 1988 at the Hyatt”. The trial judge also relied on the s 122(6) statements of the appellants in rejecting the evidence they gave at trial. He disbelieved the first appellant’s claim that the word “drug” used in his statement had been suggested to him by the recording officer, and also the second appellant’s claim that he had meant only “medicinal drugs” by the use of the word “drugs” in his statement. As for the evidence of Zainal and Ashok Kumar, both of whom had been called by the first appellant, the trial judge found in relation to the former that, his credit having been impeached, no weight could be given to his testimony. With regard to Ashok Kumar, he held that his evidence had been “destabilized and for that matter nullified” by the first appellant’s own s 122(6) statement as well as by Fullett’s evidence.Various arguments were also attempted in relation to the s 122(6) statement of the second appellant. It was submitted on behalf of the first appellant that his counsel in the court below should have been allowed to cross-examine the second appellant during the voir dire of the second appellant’s statement.

The second respondent, Abdullah bin Abdullah (“Abdullah”) was jointly tried for conspiring with Sugianto in the importation of the cannabis, also contrary to s 7 but read with s 12 of the Act. Pursuant to s 33 of the Act, both respondents would have been sentenced to death on conviction of the respective offences with which they were charged. The High Court, however, acquitted both respondents. The Public Prosecutor now appeals against their acquittals.It is now necessary to refer to the evidence in much greater detail and in logical sequence as the case against Sugianto was that he was in possession or had the custody and control of P31 and that, by reason of the presumptions in the Act, he had imported the cannabis into Singapore; the case against Abdullah was that he had assisted Sugianto by financing Sugianto’s trip to Bangkok. The learned judicial commissioner who tried this case found “that Sugianto had rebutted the operative presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the Act” and accordingly acquitted him. Having acquitted Sugianto of the offence of importing the cannabis into Singapore, the learned judicial commissioner felt impelled to acquit Abdullah as well and refused to imply a conspiracy between Sugianto and Abdullah, holding that “in the absence of an agreement to import cannabis, the charge against Abdullah of conspiring with Sugianto to import the cannabis into Singapore [was] untenable”.Accordingly, the Public Prosecutor’s appeal against the acquittal of Abdullah of conspiring with Sugianto to import the cannabis into Singapore is also dismissed.

We dismissed their appeals on 16 May 1994 and now give our reasons.The trial judge rejected the explanations proffered by the appellants. He accepted Michael’s evidence as the truth of what took place at the two meetings in Mandarin Hotel. Although the negotiations at these meetings were between the second appellant and Michael, the trial judge found that the first appellant played an important role as the person who determined the price of the drugs and the person who went to India to bring the drugs to Singapore. The trial judge disbelieved the first appellant’s evidence that he did not know English. He rejected counsel for the first appellant’s submission that the first appellant did not know of the contents of the cans. It was uncontradicted evidence in this case that the first appellant was arrested in the coffee house of Sea View Hotel with ten cans of opium and two cans of diamorphine. Further, one of the cans containing diamorphine was partially opened when Michael saw it in the coffee house. The trial judge did not doubt that the first appellant together with the second appellant had trafficked in drugs.Counsel for the first appellant raised substantially only two grounds of appeal. Firstly, that the trial judge had not given proper consideration to the first appellant’s defence that he was merely an innocent carrier and a “fall guy” for the conspiracy between the second appellant and Ram Babu to traffic in drugs. Secondly, that the trial judge erred in finding a common intention between the appellants to traffic in the drugs. We were of the opinion that the first ground of appeal was without merit. The trial judge rightly and properly rejected this defence. He found as a fact that the first appellant played an important role in the sale of the drugs to the extent that he determined the price and went to India to bring in the drugs. The trial judge disbelieved the first appellant’s evidence that he did not know English. There is absolutely no reason to disagree with the trial judge’s findings of fact on these matters, especially since he had the advantage of being able to observe the witnesses and to assess their credibility. We also reject counsel’s contention that the trial judge put words into Michael’s mouth that on the question of price of the drugs the second appellant conferred with the first appellant. The evidence was that when the issue of price came up in the negotiations between Michael and the second appellant, the latter would quote a price only after conferring with the first appellant in “an Indian language” which Michael admittedly did not understand. The evidence is therefore really irresistible that the first appellant played a role in the sale of the drugs to the extent that the second appellant had to confer with him before any price could be quoted.\n",

They were convicted and were sentenced to suffer death. Against their convictions they appealed.

He held that, on the evidence adduced by the Prosecution, a prima facie case had been made out against both appellants on their respective charges.In his grounds of decision, the trial judge held that as the appellants had travelled by flight SQ57 from Hong Kong to Singapore and had the drugs strapped on them from Hong Kong until the time of their arrest, the actus reus of importing the heroin into Singapore had been established beyond reasonable doubt. He rejected the defence of the appellants that they did not know that they were carrying the prohibited drugs and that they did not know the destination of their flight from Hong Kong to Singapore until shortly before the plane landed. As regards the first appellant, the trial judge rejected the explanation that Ah Keung had asked him (the first appellant) to carry what purported to be tranquillizers in order to evade taxes. The trial judge did not believe that the first appellant did not know he was carrying heroin, given the manner in which the drugs were to be smuggled as well as the reward offered by Ah Keung. Furthermore, there was also no mention of the defence of tranquillizers in his cautioned statement.

      "Even if such evidence is entirely excluded, there was ample evidence adduced before the trial judge which fully justified the conviction of the first appellant. Disregarding entirely the evidence of the earlier events and concentrating only on the events from 7 to 10 January 1993, we find that there was the following material evidence against the first appellant. First, there was the evidence of Tan on (a) his negotiations with the first appellant on 7, 8 and 9 January 1993; (b) the actions of the first appellant on the evening of 10 January 1993; and (c) the delivery of the bag that contained the cannabis. Next, there was the evidence that the $500 marked note given to him by Tan in part payment for the drugs was seized from him after his arrest. Thirdly, there was the cautioned statement recorded from him by the investigating officer in which he admitted to the charge. Lastly, although he did not carry the black bag that contained the cannabis, he was with the second appellant who carried the bag at the material time, and together they went and met Tan, and at Tan’s instruction, the bag was placed in the boot of Tan’s car. On the evidence adduced, he clearly knew that the bag contained cannabis, and under s 18(4) of the Act he was deemed to be in possession of the drugs found in the bag. Confronted with all this evidence, he had elected to remain silent; nor did he call any evidence in his defence. In our judgment, the charge against the first appellant has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. His appeal is plainly unsustainable and is dismissed.Here again, the trial judge has not erred in reaching this finding.

We now give our reasons.As for the parts in para 13 of the first accused’s s 121 statement rejected by the trial judge, they are clearly speculation on the part of the first accused and they have no evidential value even at this stage. Any other inference to be drawn should be left to the trial judge at the conclusion of the whole case.\n",

      "We carefully considered the totality of Quek’s evidence. We were of the opinion that the trial judge correctly rejected Quek’s defence on account of the inherent unreliability of his evidence. On this premise, we agree that his defence was a fabrication and that he had failed to rebut the statutory presumptions. Accordingly, we dismiss his appeal.At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for Lee informed the court that he had instructions to apply to withdraw the appeal. Accordingly we dismissed his appeal.On appeal, counsel for Quek submitted that the trial judge had erred in drawing only adverse inferences from the circumstances surrounding the rental of the car SZA 1092 and the rental of the Hougang flat. In doing so, the trial judge had allowed himself to be prejudiced by the evidence. It is not entirely clear whether the judge accepted the DPP’s submission that the earlier rental of SZA 1092 for the period immediately preceding 4 January 1994 was linked to drug trafficking activities as well. The Prosecution could only establish that Lee was also with Quek when SZA 1092 was rented and that Lee’s pager and telephone numbers were furnished to the car rental company. Payment for the rental charges was made by Quek and not Lee. Quek maintained that Lee was only with him occasionally and not every day for that duration. There was no other evidence of what Quek did for those 12 days when he had this vehicle. Quek claimed that most of his time during that duration was spent at the Somerset Billiard Club at Balestier Point. If renting the car had truly been intended to be an exercise in self-indulgence to celebrate his lottery winnings, there was no necessity for Lee’s presence at the time of rental or for his pager and telephone numbers to be used. Ultimately, however, there was no direct evidence adduced by the Prosecution to show that there was any connection between the rental of SZA 1092 and drug trafficking activities. It did not follow, simply because there was an earlier arrangement to rent a car (SZA 1092), that inferences could be made that this rental was also for some illicit purpose. The duty remained on the Prosecution to adduce cogent and compelling evidence that there was something covert or illicit in this rental as well. More fundamentally, it was unclear how this piece of evidence could be particularly probative.\n",

      "The respondent was acquitted of the charge of importing into Singapore not less than 3,468g of diamorphine, an offence under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”). Against his acquittal the Prosecution appealed. By a majority, with the Chief Justice dissenting, we dismissed the appeal. We now give our reasonsThe respondent, Hla Win, was acquitted of the charge of importing into Singapore 3,468g of diamorphine. His acquittal was appealed against by the Prosecution. At the conclusion of the hearing, I found the appeal to be of merit and was unable to agree with the majority decision to dismiss the appeal. The following are my reasons.In coming to my conclusion, I appreciated the fact that the respondent had been a very consistent witness. His long statement made shortly after his arrest and his evidence in court were substantially similar. Moreover, the independent evidence obtained by counsel for the respondent supported many aspects of his evidence. Nevertheless, I was of the opinion that the corroboration of his evidence and his consistency must be viewed with caution. The matters so substantiated, including the existence of Maung Maung, the Haroon Mosque, the McDonald’s Restaurant, the existence of Yusoof, the flight to Hatyai, the stay in Haadyai International Hotel and finally the flight to Singapore were features common to the operation of any smuggling outfit, whether of drugs or of gems. They were relevant to show that the respondent was a courier, which was in any event undisputed. However, these aspects were immaterial to the question of the respondent’s knowledge of what he was smuggling. As such, his truthfulness in these matters should not, in my view, be accorded undue weight when dealing with the question of knowledge. Accordingly, I would have allowed the appeal and convicted the respondent.\n",

The learned trial judge did not believe his evidence of threat and assault and on the evidence he was justified in holding that the statements had been made voluntarily by Ko.There was, therefore, ample evidence against both the appellants.

      "The evidence adduced by the Prosecution at the close of its case has been set out in detail in an earlier judgment of this court on appeal by the Prosecution against the acquittal of Tan, which was reported in PP v Tan Aik Heng [1995] 1 SLR(R) 710. We need only to recapitulate briefly such evidence. On 8 April 1994 at about 12.00 noon, a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) kept watch on the flat, #08-307, Block 62 Circuit Road (“the flat”), which belonged jointly to Foong and his wife. At about 3.00pm Foong was seen leaving the flat, and on reaching the ground floor he was arrested by three narcotics officers after a brief struggle. At that time he had with him a brown envelope which contained ten sachets of yellow granular substance, later ascertained to be heroin. After his arrest, Foong was questioned by Acting Staff Sergeant Lim Hang Meng (“Ag SSgt Lim”), and certain answers were given which we shall deal with shortly. The narcotics officers then brought Foong to his flat and they opened the door with the key seized from Foong. On entering the flat they saw Foong’s wife, Ng Soi Muay, seated in the hall watching television. Lim was seen sitting at the entrance of the kitchen facing a large number of drug exhibits which were laid out before him and holding a plastic spoon in his right hand and a small plastic sachet in his left. Tan was seen sitting and leaning against the kitchen archway, facing Lim; Tan appeared to be only talking to Lim and was doing nothing else. All of them, including Foong’s wife, were placed under arrest.Foong did not deny that the heroin found in his flat was in his possession. His defence was that he was a drug addict and that he bought the heroin for both consumption and sale. His counsel submitted that he only had to show that 11.37g were for Foong’s consumption and he intended to traffic only in 15g or less. Foong’s evidence was that he was a moderate drug addict and he consumed half a packet or about 4g per day. This was rejected by the learned trial judge on the ground that there was no credible basis for this submission. The learned trial judge found that ten small packets had already been packed and were being carried away by Foong for delivery to George. Another 31 packets had already been packed and lay on the floor and 21 empty sachets were there awaiting to be used for packing. He inferred that a total of some 60 packets were to be packed and this figure was stated in Foong’s statement. The learned trial judge was unable to accept that 23 small packets would last Foong only over a month. If Foong had been a moderate addict, he would have been referred to the hospital for his withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, Foong said that all the drugs were for his own consumption, with the exception of the ten sachets to be delivered to George. In that case, it would be unnecessary to pack an additional 31 packets. The learned trial judge was of the view that the fact that Lim was caught with one hand on a spoon and another on a bag packet showed that the packing was continuing. He was therefore of the view that only the smallest packet was meant for Foong’s consumption. There was no need to deduct this from the total amount he was charged.That was what he sought to do. There was evidence that he was a drug addict and the specimens of his urine taken soon after his arrest were found on analysis to contain morphine. In his evidence he said that he was a moderate addict consuming half a packet of heroin or about 4g of heroin per day by spiking his cigarettes. On this evidence, his counsel submitted that out of the 26.37g of heroin, the subject matter of the charge, 11.37g or 43.1% thereof were for Foong’s consumption and that the balance being only 15g or less was intended for sale. This argument was rejected by the learned trial judge and, in our view, rightly, on the ground that there was “no credible basis” in support and there was evidence to the contrary. Firstly, ten sachets had already been packed and Foong was on his way to deliver them to George. He had agreed to sell these ten packets to George, and whether they were sold at cost or at a small profit is immaterial. Secondly, in his flat there were 31 sachets which had been packed and were lying on the floor. There were further 21 empty sachets lying there to be used for packing the remaining granular substance from the big packet and Lim was engaged in the process of packing the drugs. Lying there also were all the drug-related paraphernalia. The inference is that all these drugs would be packed into sachets of approximately 8g each and were intended for sale or distribution. The best that can be said for Foong is that the drugs were meant both for consumption and for sale. But in this case the fact that some of the drugs would be used for his own consumption is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that he had possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking in view of the evidence which we have just discussed.\n",

There the accused, Tan Ah Tee and Low Hong Eng, were observed by narcotics officers walking towards a car near Block A, Far East Mansion, Kim Yam Road. Tan Ah Tee was seen holding a plastic bag and on approaching the car he was seen handing the bag to Hong Eng.

      "Lord Diplock’s judgment was considered by this court in Syed Feisal bin Yahya v PP [1992] 1 SLR(R) 853. In that case, the district judge, relying on Lord Diplock’s speech in Ong Ah Chuan, had acquitted the appellant on the charge of trafficking by transportation. The appellant in Syed Feisal had conveyed 22.33kg of cannabis. Although the district judge found as a fact that the appellant had conveyed the drugs, the judge held that he had no intention to part with possession of the drugs at the apartment to which he had conveyed the drugs (even though his ultimate intention was to sell the drugs) and accordingly was not guilty of trafficking by transporting. The Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court’s reversal of that decision and in the process clarified what was said by Lord Diplock. The Court of Appeal said (at [27]) that:He was convicted of the offence in the High Court and sentenced to death. He appealed against conviction and sentence. We dismissed his appeal and now give our reasons.Be that as it may, we are of the opinion that the admission of similar fact evidence, at least for the purposes identified in ss 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act, should be governed by the balancing test adopted by the House of Lords in Boardman’s case. Such an approach is warranted both in principle as well as on the wording of the legislation itself. As to the former, it has been argued above that the rationale of the rule excluding similar fact evidence is so that every person charged with an offence may only be convicted upon being proved to have committed the acts within the charge. It would be subverting established jurisprudence to allow conviction based on the particular disposition of the accused – based on the contention that the accused is that type of person who would commit such an offence. On the other hand, there may be cases where the interest of justice clearly outweigh any prejudicial dangers inherent in the evidence. No doubt, in this jurisdiction, the trial judge being the trier of fact will have to be familiar with the similar facts in order to rule as to its relevance. However, we think ingenuous the argument that a strict enforcement of the similar fact rule is futile if the evidence has already been allowed to infiltrate the mind of the trial judge. All we say in response is that we are far more confident in the ability of judges to disregard prejudicial evidence when the need arises and we refer in this respect to the remarks of this court in Tan Chee Kieng v PP [1994] 2 SLR(R) 577.\n",

He became acquainted with Abdul Raman and Abdul Raman allowed him free access to the coffeeshop and to the upper floor, where in fact Abuhari was when NO Rosli and the CNB agent arrived that day. So, when the CNB agent enquired after Abuhari, Abdul Raman had a female employee of his take the CNB agent to the upper floor to Abuhari whilst he, Abdul Raman, went about his business.This aspect of Abuhari’s defence is purely on the facts. His is a most unlikely story. The evidence of NO Rosli and Abdul Raman implicates Abuhari to the hilt, although Abdul Raman’s evidence in his own defence is another unlikely story. The learned trial judge having carefully examined Abuhari’s evidence, in the light of the whole of the evidence, rejected it and we see no reason to disagree with him. We need not burden this judgment further by going into details having already set out both appellants’ evidence extensively.Once the evidence of NO Rosli was accepted and the evidence of the two appellants rejected, then it became abundantly clear that Abuhari, in delivering the plastic bag containing the cannabis to NO Rosli, was acting in furtherance of the plan to sell the cannabis to NO Rosli, which was negotiated in the coffeeshop by both Abdul Raman and Abuhari. Thus the act of Abuhari is also the act of Abdul Raman. In our judgment the elements of common intention were abundantly present.\n",

As a result, the charges against Rahmah and Siti were withdrawn and they were given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal. Both of them subsequently testified as prosecution witnesses.At the trial below, Rahmah stated that she became a lessee of the flat sometime in April 1995 and stayed in the flat until June 1995 after which she went to stay with her boyfriend in his apartment.

She also stated that at or about the time of the arrest, she was working at the appellant’s drinks stall on an evening shift. She earned $800 a month.The trial judge rejected the expert evidence of the Defence and concluded that the appellant was a moderate drug addict whose maximum consumption was six to seven straws daily which amounted to 0.21g nett of diamorphine.

At the conclusion of the trial and after hearing their defences, the learned trial judge acquitted Tay Bee Hoon of both the non-capital and the capital charges of trafficking. However, he convicted the appellant on the capital charge of trafficking as well as on the non-capital charge of trafficking based on his plea of guilty.We do not find it necessary to refer to the other issues canvassed before us on the appeal. They do not bear on the defence of “own consumption” and in any case are not relevant or are without merit. We should, however, mention that an issue was raised that as the capital charge of trafficking was a “common intention charge” and the learned judge having acquitted the other conspirator, Tay Bee Hoon, the conviction of the appellant without amending the charge was irregular. True, the learned judge did not amend the charge; he found that the appellant alone was in possession of the 40 sachets of heroin and that he failed to make good that he was in possession of the 40 sachets for his and Tay Bee Hoon’s consumption. Suffice it to say that “s 34 of the Penal Code does not create a substantive offence; it lays down only a rule of evidence to infer joint responsibility” (per Thean J (as he then was) in Chota bin Abdul Razak v PP [1991] 1 SLR(R) 501).

We now give our reasons.Overall, the Prosecution’s case was that relying on the undisputed evidence that a large amount of heroin was seized from the flat; the current tenancy of which was in the name of the appellant; the recovery of the keys to the flat from the appellant; the recovery of five sachets on the person of the appellant and the admission by the appellant that he had handled and packed quite a number of sachets on the day of his arrest, the statutory presumption operated against the appellant and a prima facie case of being in possession of the heroin for the purpose of trafficking was made out. It was at this stage that the Prosecution applied to amalgamate the two charges into one. As we have noted earlier, this application was not resisted and was allowed. Accordingly the appellant’s defence on the amalgamated charge was called. A submission of “no case to answer” was not made.On a review of all the evidence, leaving aside the appellant’s claim that the five sachets which contained not less than 2.58g of diamorphine were for his own consumption, the trial judge rejected the appellant’s claim that Ah Seng was the real tenant and occupier of the flat and that Ah Seng was the exclusive owner of the heroin.\n",

      "At the inception of the trial, the appellant was charged together with one Koh Chiang Meng (“Koh”). Koh faced four non-capital drug-related charges, whilst the appellant faced three similar charges, of which one was a capital charge. The Prosecution applied for a joint trial of the charges. The trial judge rejected the application and ordered the Prosecution to proceed to trial only on the capital charge against the appellant. All other charges were stood down and the counsel for Koh was released. The Prosecution then applied to amend the capital charge. At the end of the trial, the appellant was convicted on the amended charge and sentenced to the mandatory punishment of death. The appellant appealed against his conviction. After hearing counsel for the appellant, we dismissed the appeal. We now give our reasons.However, the trial judge rejected the appellant’s attempt to make himself out to be a gullible and naive person who was a mere bailee or servant under the control of Ah Soon and who did not know how [what] drugs looked like. The trial judge found the appellant to be well educated and intelligent. He spoke English fluently, articulated well and sat with composure in the witness stand. The appellant also admitted to fraternising freely with illegal bookies and punters. The appellant was obviously a streetwise person who would not be beguiled by the likes of Ah Soon. By his own admission, the appellant had examined the contents of the bag Ah Soon had allegedly left in the boot of his car without his knowledge and found it to contain packets wrapped in brown paper.Strangely enough, the appellant had not gone on to examine the contents of the packets. Instead, he had unzipped his black sports bag and found it filled with packets containing what he believed to be “keropok”. The trial judge found that the appellant must have realised that the packets could not possibly have contained “keropok”. There was no reason why someone like Ah Soon would want to deliver packets of “keropok” in such a surreptitious manner. The trial judge also rejected the appellant’s claim that he had not noticed the 7-Eleven plastic bag. The 7-Eleven plastic bag had been found right next to the black canvas bag in the boot of the appellant’s car. The appellant could not possibly have failed to notice it.\n",

We heard his appeal on 19 January 1998, which we dismissed, without the necessity of hearing the deputy public prosecutor, for the reasons we now give.The learned judge dismissed the point as being one without merit but defence counsel persisted in it and it was also the main point of his submissions before us. In substance his submission was that P74 was a statement recorded under s 122(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. This could not have been further from the truth as ASP Chew’s evidence is crystal clear that the first lot of questions were asked of the appellant at the void deck on the ground floor of Block 438 immediately following the appellant’s arrest. The second set of questions were asked in the master bedroom of flat #04-1341 as soon as the appellant, ASP Chew and the escorting narcotic officers had arrived there and the appellant had indicated with his chin to the wardrobe as to where “the anything” was. It was plainly and simply a contemporaneous note of the oral statements made by the appellant immediately following his arrest, no doubt prompted by the questions put to him. “Investigation” as one understands it, in the context of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) or otherwise could hardly have begun so immediately following the arrest. In our view, the oral statements are relevant as they go to show that the appellant had the knowledge of the nature of the substances he was in possession of and form part of the transaction of being in possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking. They are therefore relevant and admissible under ss 6 and 5 respectfully of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (see Chi Tin Hui v PP [1994] 1 SLR(R) 313 at [27]). P74 was but a contemporaneous record of the oral statements.There was no merit at all in any of the submissions made to us and we accordingly dismissed this appeal without having to hear the learned deputy public prosecutor.\n",

      "Both accused were convicted of the respective charges against them. Only the second accused (“the appellant”) appealed against his conviction and sentence. We dismissed the appeal at the conclusion of the hearing and now give our reasons. It is necessary to set out and deal in detail with the evidence adduced in the court below as one of the principal grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant was that, at the close of its case against the appellant, the Prosecution had not made out a case against him which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. We begin with the background facts to the case.The learned judicial commissioner was not sufficiently convinced, bearing in mind that the onus of proof was on the Defence to raise a reasonable doubt, that DSP Vijakumar and SSSgt Wong had told the first accused that they would help take the rope off his neck or that he had been knocked on the head, albeit that this occurred only once. In any event, the learned judicial commissioner did not think that a knock on the head in the manner described by the first accused was sufficient duress. Nor could a call to co-operate be regarded as a threat or inducement even if it was accompanied, as in this case, by a remark that the first accused would be allowed to call his wife if he co-operated. Similarly, a statement to the first accused not to lie because DSP Vijakumar could tell whether or not he was lying merely by looking at his eyes could not be considered a threat, inducement or promise. After considering the evidence, the learned judicial commissioner was satisfied that the statements of the first accused had been made without any threat, inducement or promise from the CNB officers. Accordingly, the learned judicial commissioner admitted the statements in evidence.Counsel for the first accused submitted that the first accused’s defence was that he had no knowledge of the contents of the bundles strapped to his body. He accepted that the presumption under s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act applied, but argued that the presumption could be rebutted by the evidence from the Prosecution itself. In particular, he referred to the part of the statement P32 made by the first accused where the first accused said he did not know, when asked by W/ASP Diong, what was inside his shirt. Counsel further submitted that the bundles were so tightly wrapped (that even the police photographer had to cut them open) that the first accused could not have had the opportunity to inspect their contents. Counsel explained that the bundles were strapped to the first accused because that was the only way he could carry them as he did not have a carrier bag with him at that time. This explanation was offered to refute the natural inference that the manner in which the bundles were strapped in itself suggested that the first accused knew or ought to have known that he was carrying illegal substances. The learned judicial commissioner rejected this and held that, without any evidence from the first accused (as opposed to statements from the Bar), the presumption against the first accused was not rebutted.\n",

      "This was an appeal against conviction of the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). We dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.At the trial, counsel contended that P72 had been involuntarily made as the investigating officer had assured Cheng before the statement was recorded that the statement would be used against Sum but not against him, and had abused Cheng and said to him: “You better co-operate with me and I will help you. If not, you will surely hang.” It was also alleged that no interpreter was in the interview room when Cheng was asked if he wished to speak in English, and that the statement had been handed to Cheng to read at the end of the interview without his request. The voluntariness of P108 was likewise challenged on the grounds that the investigating officer had assured Cheng during the interview that P108 would not be used against him, and had promised to help Cheng if the latter was co-operative. The learned trial judge rejected Cheng’s complaints as he found that they were marred by inconsistencies. He considered that Cheng had improvised on these allegations as he gave evidence in the course of the trial. Before us, counsel submitted that the learned trial judge erred in holding P72 and P108 to be voluntary and admissible as the alleged inconsistencies in Cheng’s evidence during the voir dire could either be explained, or were minor in light of the fact that some ten months had lapsed since the statements were recorded such that Cheng’s memory of the events during the interview might have been dimmed.We found nothing to suggest that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in admitting the statements. In his examination-in-chief during the voir dire relating to P72, Cheng claimed that the investigating officer had told him only once during the interview, “You better co-operate with me and I will help you. If not, you will surely hang”, and that was when he denied any knowledge that P93 and P98 contained drugs. In cross-examination though, he said that the investigating officer had uttered this threat twice during the interview, once after his personal particulars had been taken down, and again midway through the interview. There were similar inconsistencies in Cheng’s evidence during the voir dire in respect of P108. He initially claimed that the investigating officer had said at the end of the interview when reading the statement back to him “This statement is not going to used against you but against the Malaysian [ie Sum]”, but later alleged that the investigating officer had said “If you help me, I will help you” instead. Although these inconsistencies may appear to have been minor, bearing in mind the opportunity which the learned trial judge had of observing Cheng’s conduct and demeanour during the voir dire, we were of the view that there were sufficient grounds for the learned trial judge to find that Cheng was not a credible witness and that his allegations against the investigating officer ought to be disbelieved. We also found that the learned trial judge was justified in dismissing Cheng’s contention that the interpreter was not in the interview room when he was asked if he wished to speak in English. The interpreter’s evidence was that Cheng, without waiting for him to interpret, had told the investigating officer that he wished to speak in English. The interpreter testified that he remembered this incident clearly as it was the first time that his services as an interpreter had been requested for but subsequently not used. We upheld these findings of fact made by the learned trial judge in the course of the voir dire as they could not be said to be clearly against the weight of the evidence.

The appellants appealed against their conviction and sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.The second appellant had allowed one Rashidah bte Ishak, a freelance Muslim wedding service co-ordinator, to store her decoration materials at the shop for $200 per month. She was not given a key to the shop. On 8 March 1998, at about 9.00am, she met the second appellant at the shop when she went there to collect some of her materials. She had telephoned him the day before to make the appointment. Her things were stored between the front entrance and a wooden cabinet which stood in the middle of the shop. Hence she did not have to go beyond the wooden cabinet when she was in the shop. Whilst she was in the shop, the second appellant was positioned near the cabinet. She was in the shop for only a short while and left after retrieving her things. The second appellant remained in the shop.This concerned the first appellant’s second statement recorded by SSSgt Wong with the assistance of an interpreter at the MIB Building on 11 March 1998 at about 5.30pm (P75A). The appellant alleged that this statement was involuntary for the following reasons. First, that SSSgt Wong told him that if he told the true story, there would be hope; second, that Assistant Superintendent Adam Fashehuddin (“ASP Adam”) and Deputy Superintendent S Vijakumar (“DSP Vijakumar”) gave him the impression that if he co-operated, there was a hope for him; third, that the interpreter interpreted the whole cautioned statement to the first appellant and this induced fear in him; and fourth, that during the recording, SSSgt Wong told him that if he did not continue to give a statement, he would not be allowed to see his wife and children.\n",

      "The appellant, Satli bin Masot, was charged in the High Court that he, on 20 June 1998, at or about 3.48pm, at Block 99 Kang Ching Road, #10-616, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class “A” of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act by having in his possession for the purposes of trafficking seven packets, 255 sachets and one bowl containing not less than 147.58 g of diamorphine, without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and that he had thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“MDA”). At the end of the trial, the trial judge convicted the appellant of the charge and sentenced him to the mandatory punishment of death. The appellant appealed against his conviction and sentence. After hearing counsel for the appellant, we dismissed the appeal. We now give our reasons.The trial judge dismissed the defence based on a break in the chain of evidence as he had no doubt that the drug exhibits analysed by the DSS were the same exhibits seized from the appellant’s flat. Although Insp Goh could not recall exactly whether it was SSgt Tai or Sgt Phao who carried the large plastic bag containing the drugs from the flat to the car, she had accompanied them all the time while one of them was carrying the bag and had kept them and the bag containing the drugs within her view throughout. In the circumstances, whether it was SSgt Tai or Sgt Phao who in fact carried the bag was immaterial. The trial judge also found no basis for drawing an adverse inference against the Prosecution for not calling SSgt Tai or Sgt Phao as he was of the view that their evidence was not essential to the Prosecution’s case, the Prosecution having already proven the identity of the drug exhibits analysed by Dr Lee of the DSS beyond reasonable doubt. The trial judge held that the presumption in s 17 of the MDA applied and remained unrebutted when the appellant elected to remain silent and called no other evidence in his defence. He held that there was ample evidence that the appellant had possession of the drugs at the material time and that those drugs were for the purpose of trafficking. He thus convicted the appellant on the charge and sentenced him to death.We were of the view that the trial judge rightly rejected the defence based on a break in the chain of evidence. In cases where a break in the chain of evidence is alleged, the contention really centres on the identity of the drugs involved, namely whether the drugs analysed by the DSS and forming the basis of the charge against the appellant were in fact those seized from the appellant’s possession. In Lim Swee Seng v PP [1995] 1 SLR(R) 32 at [26], we summed up the issue for determination in cases like this in the following terms:\n",

At the end of the trial, Raseed was acquitted and discharged on the basis that neither the requisite possession nor common intention to traffic were proven against him beyond a reasonable doubt. The Prosecution did not appeal against his acquittal. It is necessary, however, to review all the evidence below by reason of the arguments raised before us by Aziz’s counsel.It will be remembered that Aziz and Raseed were jointly charged that pursuant to the common intention of them both they had committed the offence of trafficking in controlled drugs by being in possession of cannabis and cannabis mixture. At the end of the trial the learned trial judge found as a fact that Aziz alone was in possession of the cannabis and the cannabis mixture. Accordingly he acquitted Raseed of the joint charge as common intention had not been proved against him and proceeded to convict Aziz on the joint charge.This was an appeal against the conviction of the appellant for trafficking in controlled drugs by having in his possession on 5 June 1998, for the purpose of trafficking, 4,872.7g of cannabis and 5,678.12g of cannabis mixture. These are offences under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1993 Ed) (“the Act”). We heard his appeal on 5 April 1999 and dismissed it. These are our reasons.\n",

      "On 28 January 2000, the two appellants were convicted and sentenced to death by Justice Kan Ting Chiu (“the trial judge”) under separate charges of drug trafficking. Both the appellants appealed against their conviction and sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed the appeals and now give our reasons.Boksenang admitted that he had been avoiding arrest by the CNB since 20 March 1999 but he denied that the packets of drugs found in the haversack in the Ang Mo Kio flat belonged to him. He identified the haversack as belonging to Sharom and maintained that he never borrowed or took custody of the bag from Sharom at any time. He claimed that he was not at the Ang Mo Kio flat during the period of 14 to 19 March 1999 and he did not meet Sharom on 14 March (Sunday), much less borrow the latter’s haversack on that day. Like Sharom, Boksenang also sought to distance himself from the Ang Mo Kio flat. He claimed that he rented and stayed at a room in the Jelapang flat with his wife, Lisfah. Whilst he also rented the Ang Mo Kio flat from the HDB and had furnished it substantially after receiving the keys on 1 February 1999, he did not move into the flat as he had resumed his heroin addiction and was afraid that the CNB would trace him to his rented flat. Instead, he allowed Sharom to stay in the Ang Mo Kio flat since February 1999 as the latter had requested for a place to stay with his girlfriend, Norsila. Sharom needed a place to stay as he believed his other accommodation at Block 195 Kim Keat Avenue #04-324 was suspected by the CNB as being the place where he was selling heroin. Thus, a set of keys to the Ang Mo Kio flat was given to Sharom by Boksenang. Boksenang claimed that he and his wife never stayed at the Ang Mo Kio flat except for once after he gave the keys to Sharom and it was Sharom who occupied the flat with Norsila until Sharom was arrested on 20 March 1999.Turning to Boksenang, the trial judge rejected his claim that he did not stay at the Ang Mo Kio flat as there was sufficient evidence to show otherwise. However, what the trial judge found to be most incriminating was the confession he made in P47. He rejected the allegations of involuntariness raised by Boksenang in relation to the recording of P47 and found that it contained the truth of the events. Based on Boksenang’s own admission, the trial judge found that he had bought 25 packets of heroin from Bai, of which he sold ten packets to Sharom.\n",

      "He appealed against his conviction. We heard his appeal and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.The appellant’s assertion of total ignorance of the contents was rejected by the trial judge. In the trial judge’s view, the circumstances in which the appellant came into possession of the bag, if true, were so suspicious that it would require a totally mindless person to have done what the appellant claimed he did. Even if he did not suspect anything illicit, he surely would have enquired from Ah Beh or his two associates what the contents were. He would have needed to know if the contents were fragile or perishable in order to discharge his duties responsibly. At the least, he would have opened the bag for a peek, for it was not as if he had been instructed not to look. He did not bother to ask why the bag should be kept by him for a few days. All of this was compounded by the fact that the owner of the bag was not only someone unknown to him, but a former prison inmate. The trial judge therefore found that the appellant clearly knew that what he was receiving and keeping was a controlled drug.The appellant’s sole contention on appeal centred on the issue of possession. Contrary to the appellant’s submission, the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt the appellant’s possession of the diamorphine. Nothing was raised in the court below and nothing raised on appeal which rebutted the s 17(c) presumption of drug trafficking triggered by the proof of the appellant’s possession of not less than 130.46g of diamorphine. For these reasons, we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the sentence.\n",

      "At the appeal, counsel for the appellant brought up several interrelated issues pertaining to the proof of possession as well as the admissibility of three long statements that were highly incriminating to the appellant. We unanimously rejected the submissions. We agreed that Justice MPH Rubin’s scrutiny of facts was meticulous and that his findings of facts were amply justified. There was neither strong nor compelling ground, on either law or facts, to justify quashing the conviction.The appellant’s bare denial in his cautioned statement, in the circumstances in which the haversack that contained the drug was found on him, as well as the finding and seizure of the drug-related paraphernalia by the CND officers in his presence at the Yishun apartment, allowed the court to infer that the appellant did have knowledge of the drug in the haversack.In this case, possession of 32.27g of diamorphine was proven beyond reasonable doubt. The presumption under s 17 MDA was triggered. The appellant’s election to remain silent, refusal to call any witnesses, failure to explain his possession of the drug and to present final submissions at the trial, made it impossible for him to discharge the burden of rebutting the presumption against him, or to cast reasonable doubt on the case. There was no compelling reason to fault the trial judge’s decision to admit the three long statements. For the above reasons, we dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction and sentence.\n",

Tan was charged with abetting the appellant in a conspiracy with the appellant and others, sometime in April 1999, to traffic in that quantity of opium by arranging for such quantity of opium to be delivered to the appellant in order that the appellant be put in possession thereof for the purpose of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 12 and punishable under s 33 of the Act. At the conclusion of the trial, Tan was acquitted of the charge, but the appellant was convicted and was sentenced to suffer death. Against his conviction, he appealed. We dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.Ang was an opium addict, and initially he was jointly charged with the appellant for trafficking in the 32 slabs of opium. However, he had since been given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, upon application of the Prosecution. He was called as a witness for the Prosecution and his evidence so far as concerned the appellant was as follows. He testified that on the night before the arrest, he spoke to Tan over the telephone and Tan agreed to sell him one “liap” of opium and told him that someone would deliver the opium on the following morning. On the following morning, his pager beeped, and he called that number and spoke to the person and discussed how to take delivery of the “thing” on that morning. He then went downstairs. When he reached the roadside of Jalan Kukoh he saw a blue car coming, and the car stopped at the roadside. He opened the front passenger door and asked the driver whether he was delivering the goods. The driver was the appellant who answered in the affirmative, but before he could say anything they were both arrested.The appellant made several statements to the police and all of them were admitted in evidence as having been made voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise from any of the recording personnel. In his first statement, the appellant said that he was asked by one Ah Seow (also referred to as “Ah Shiao”) to deliver the “things”, which were seized from his car, and he did not know what those things were, and for delivering them he was to be paid $500. His second statement made reference to a piece of paper, Exh P-158, seized from him upon his arrest, which contained particulars as to delivery of the goods. He confirmed that the piece of paper was given to him by Ah Seow. His third statement related to identification of Tan. He disclaimed any knowledge of Tan or one Lim Chew Hing (“Lim”). Lim was arrested together with Tan and both of them were jointly charged for abetting the appellant in a conspiracy to traffic in opium, but later on application of the Prosecution Lim was granted a discharge not amounting to acquittal. The appellant also said that neither Tan nor Lim was Ah Seow.\n",

Also tried jointly with them was the second appellant, Wong Kok Loong (“Wong”), who was charged with trafficking in the same quantity of drugs by delivering the drugs to Salam and Suboh at Block 489, Jurong West Avenue 1, #03-37 on that day, at or about 2.20pm, an offence under s 5(1)(a) and punishable under s 33 of the Act. At the conclusion of the trial, the judge found that the Prosecution had not proved its case against Salam beyond reasonable doubt, and accordingly he acquitted Salam. The judge, however, found that the Prosecution had proved the charges against Suboh and Wong respectively, and he accordingly convicted them of the charges respectively and sentenced them to suffer death. Both Suboh and Wong appealed against the decision of the judge.At any rate, even if the judge had rejected Salam’s evidence on the ground that Salam was untruthful and unreliable, and convicted Salam of the charge, we do not see how such a result would or could have any effect or impact on the defence of Suboh. It certainly would not exonerate him from the charge. Salam’s lies, which were relied on heavily in the argument by Suboh’s counsel, concerned only Salam himself and does not impinge on Suboh’s defence or guilt. The judge certainly did not rely on Salam’s lies to convict Suboh. The evidence of Salam on which the judge relied in acquitting him has no bearing on the defence of Suboh in relation to the charge.There is no merit in the appeal by Wong. We agree entirely with the trial judge’s finding that the Prosecution had proved the charge against Wong beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal brought by Wong.\n",

      "As a result of the material contradictions between Katheraven’s oral testimony and his previous statements, the Prosecution applied for leave to refer to previous inconsistent and contradictory statements made by Katheraven with a view to impeaching his credit. These previous statements were: (a) a signed statement recorded on 20 January 2000, Exh P29 (P29); (b) a statement of facts which was produced in court and to which he admitted when he pleaded guilty to the trafficking charges on 16 June 2000, Exh P46 (P46); (c) a statement recorded on 16 June 2000 after he had pleaded guilty to the trafficking charges, Exh P49 (P49). The trial judge having read the statements allowed the Prosecution to refer Katheraven to the statements and to cross-examine him with a view to impeaching his credit. The trial judge also admitted the statements as evidence of the facts stated therein under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. In so doing, the trial judge took the view that there was no necessity to conduct a voir dire to satisfy himself that the statements, P29 and P49, were made by Katheraven voluntarily. The material portions of the three statements were substantially similar and implicated the appellant in the supply of the drugs to Katheraven.So far as material, his evidence of the material events is as follows. At about 6.30pm, on 13 January 2000, he went to the coffeeshop at Block 632 Ang Mo Kio to meet a friend Shanmugam. Shortly after, he met one Thambi, who had sold VCDs to him in the past. At Thambi’s request, the appellant followed him to the coffeeshop at Block 630 to discuss something important. There, he saw Joe, a close friend of Thambi. Thambi and Joe were known to both him and Katheraven. Thambi said that Katheraven telephoned him the previous day to arrange to buy some stuff, which he said was drugs. Thambi spoke to Joe, and both of them made arrangements to supply the drugs to Katheraven who took them, saying that he would pay later and that he would not cheat them. As he was a close friend of the appellant, Joe trusted Katheraven and allowed him to take the stuff. That was the first time he heard of the transaction, and he was shocked and surprised that Joe was a drug pusher. He was told that Katheraven had since failed to make the payment. Joe told him to call Katheraven to come to the coffeeshop, since Katheraven was his friend. They also insisted that he pay on Katheraven’s behalf and that he could collect the money from Katheraven, since they were friends. When the appellant protested, Joe shouted at him, and threatened to do something to him and Katheraven if he failed to call Katheraven and ask him to come by 8.00pm to pay them the money. He then agreed to locate Katheraven and tell him to see them.The Privy Council rejected this argument. Lord Diplock delivering the judgment of the Board said at 56:\n",

      "This was an appeal against the decision of Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck, who convicted the appellant, Ramis a/l Muniandy (“Ramis”) of an offence pursuant to s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1998 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) and sentenced him to suffer the punishment of death. We dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.The judicial commissioner also accepted the evidence of Rajkumar, who testified that he had the motorcycle in his sight at all times and saw no one approaching it. The judicial commissioner rejected the defence contention that Ramis was waiting for about 20 minutes, accepting the Prosecution’s evidence that the arrest was effected within five minutes of Ramis’s arrival. He held that, even if Rajkumar had had a momentary lapse of concentration, there was no reason in the circumstances why anybody would have left the bag on Ramis’s motorcycle. Therefore he did not accept this remote possibility as having sufficient weight to create any doubt that Ramis carried the bag with him as he entered Marsiling Industrial Estate Road 4.In the present case, Ramis’ only defence was that the bag was not his and that someone else must have put it there. We have rejected this. He did not raise the argument that he was a mere bailee. We were also not satisfied that Ramis had no opportunity to acquaint himself with the contents of the bag which was found on his motorcycle. We found that the drugs were already on his motorcycle and in his control when he arrived in the vicinity. He had ample opportunity to examine the contents of the bag. Therefore it was our view that Ramis did not raise any explanation to rebut the strong inference that he had knowledge of the drugs on his motorcycle.\n",

      "The appellant, Abdul Malik bin Abdul Jamil (“Malik”) was tried and convicted of the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug, namely, that he had on 31 January 2001, in his possession for the purpose of trafficking not less than 31.91g of diamorphine, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1998 Ed) and punishable under s 33 of the Act. Another person, Norazmi bin Morsit (“Norazmi”) was also jointly tried with him and Norazmi was convicted of aiding and abetting the appellant in the commission of the offence. Norazmi withdrew his appeal against his conviction and sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing of the appellant’s appeal, we dismissed it. We now give our reasons.According to Malik, after his examination by Dr Ong and before being brought to Insp Saherly’s office he told Corporal Anan that he was in pain and was hungry. But when Cpl Anan was cross-examined in the voir dire this allegation was not put to him. Insp Saherly denied that Malik told him about his pain. Neither did he know that Malik was hungry. Nor did he offer any inducement to Malik that he would be allowed to see the doctor if he had made the statement quickly. The evidence of Insp Saherly was corroborated by Ms Sofia bte Sufri, the Malay interpreter who was present at the recording of the cautioned statement.These allegations were rejected by the trial judge. In this regard, we must observe that Malik had just returned from seeing Dr Ong. He told Dr Ong about his fall from the motorcycle. He did not complain of any serious pain. Dr Ong merely noted that there was “tenderness” on his chest. We did not think there could be any truth in the allegation that Insp Saherly promised to bring him to a doctor if he gave a statement quickly. He was, of course, brought to see Dr Chiam for the normal post-statement examination. Dr Chiam said there was mild right-sided tenderness on the chest wall.\n",

While the court should consider any explanation that the accused person gives for his change of position, the explanation can be rejected if it is found to be untrue.It must be noted that neither Syed nor Roetikno denied that they had given the statements to the CNB voluntarily. Syed’s reasons as to why his confessions were fabricated were not credible. He claimed to have falsely incriminated himself and Roetikno although he knew that the offence in question carried the death penalty. In any case, the exculpatory version of facts given by Syed at the trial did not appear anywhere in his statements to the CNB. As for Roetikno, his reasons for lying in his statements to the CNB were understandably rejected by the trial judge. Although he claimed that he wanted to help Syed, he incriminated the latter in his statements. If he was, as he claimed, innocent, all that he had to do was to assert his innocence. Instead, he chose to admit that he and Syed were packing drugs in Room 406 of Taipei Hotel at the material time. In our view, the judge had good grounds for holding that the appellants’ confessions in their statements to the CNB were true.As the appellants were not able to establish that the trial judge erred in convicting them, their appeals were dismissed.\n",

      "We were of the view that Tay J was correct to have convicted the appellant. Firstly, the Prosecution had proved that the appellant had in his possession and control the keys to the flat and to the rented room. Thus, s 18(1)(c) of the MDA applied and the appellant was presumed to have had the drugs in his possession. Secondly, because he was presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession, s 18 (2) of the MDA applied. Thus, he was then presumed to have known the nature of the drugs (ie cannabis). Thirdly, the Prosecution proved that the drugs in the appellant’s possession were meant for the purposes of trafficking. The sheer quantity of the drugs (not less than 2,715.6g of cannabis) and the drug trafficking paraphernalia found in the flat went to prove that the drugs were meant for the purposes of trafficking. Fourthly, as regards s 5(1)(a) of the MDA, the trafficking of the drugs was not authorised. Fifthly, by virtue of s 5(2) of the MDA, the appellant had committed the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug since he had in his possession that drug (ie the cannabis) for the purpose of trafficking. Lastly, s 33 of the MDA, in conjunction with the Second Schedule, provides that where the quantity of cannabis being trafficked without authorisation is more than 500g, the punishment shall be death. Because the appellant and Bala were acting in concert in possessing the cannabis for the purpose of trafficking, s 34 of the Penal Code was correctly applied. For the reasons above we dismissed the appeal.\n",

Even when Teo was giving evidence in his defence, the points raised by him were not in relation to voluntariness of his other statements. What he claimed was that the incriminating parts of the long statements were fabricated by him. This claim was, in the event, rejected by the trial judge. It would be useful at this stage to recall what was observed by the Federal Court of Malaysia (per Chong Min Tat FJ) in Lee Weng Sang at 171. He said:It was contended on behalf of the appellant in Osman bin Din that the fact that there were no prints to implicate him supported his defence that the drugs did not belong to him and that he did not know the contents of the bag. The court rejected this argument and held that there was no primary or statutory obligation on the part of the authorities to undertake a fingerprint examination, particularly in a case where the appellant was apprehended with the offending substance. The court further held that in any event, within the statutory framework of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1985 Rev Ed), once possession was prima facie established, it was for the accused person to explain how he came into possession of the drugs.Accordingly, for the reasons given above, we dismissed the appeal.\n",

      "This case began with the joint trial of three persons accused of trafficking in 75.56g of diamorphine. The charges against the first and third accused were for abetment of trafficking by the second accused. At the end of the trial the court convicted the first and second accused, now the first and second appellants respectively, but acquitted the third. The convicted persons appealed against their convictions but before us, Mr Aqbal Singh, counsel for the first appellant, informed us that he was instructed to make no submissions on behalf of his client. We proceeded to hear Mr Ismail Hamid, counsel for the second appellant, and not being persuaded, we dismissed the appeal of the second appellant. There being no submissions on behalf of the first appellant, and we were satisfied from the record that there were no merits in the appeal, we also dismissed the appeal of the first appellant. We now set out the grounds of our decision in respect of our dismissal of the second appellant’s appeal.The Prosecution’s case against the three accused were founded on the statements given by them to the CNB officers. The key evidence was that of the second appellant who stated that he collected the drugs from the first appellant on the instructions given to him by the third accused. The first appellant admitted in his statements that he had given the drugs to the second appellant at Block 108. The sequence of events was elaborated in the statements of the second appellant as follows. He stated that at 10.00am of 7 January 2004, the third accused telephoned him and told him to collect something from the first appellant at Yishun. About half an hour later, the second appellant received another call on his handphone but he did not know who the caller was. He spoke in Malay and told the second appellant to go to Block 108 at Yishun and to wait at the carpark near the lift. When the second appellant arrived at the carpark, he received another call from the man and was instructed to wait ten minutes before taking the lift to the fifth floor. At the fifth floor, the first appellant entered the lift and gave the second appellant a white plastic bag. No words were exchanged between them. The first appellant got off on the fourth floor and the second appellant returned to his car where he telephoned the third accused and asked him who the bag was for. He was told to wait for the third accused’s call. But the second appellant was arrested before any further contact could be made. On these straightforward facts the trial judge convicted the first and second appellant, but acquitted the third accused on the ground that the only evidence against him was the unreliable evidence of the second appellant.We see no reason to disturb the findings of fact by the trial judge nor his conclusion that the second appellant was guilty of trafficking. Since the amount of diamorphine involved was more than 15g, the mandatory death penalty applied and was so pronounced by the trial judge. For these reasons, we dismissed the appeal of the second appellant. However, in the course of delivering his grounds the trial judge referred to the statutory presumptions under ss 17 and 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) which we must address. We are mindful that neither party addressed that point before us (it was unnecessary for either side). However, as it is an important point and since the court below had expressed a definite opinion upon which our comment is necessary, we would proceed to do so.\n",

      "The first appellant was charged with the offence of importing a controlled drug into Singapore under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). The offence was stated to be committed on 27 November 2004. No time was specified. The trial judge found that the first appellant had arrived in Singapore at 1.45pm. The first appellant made enquiries for a room in the hotel at the transit area of the airport the following day. The time he made the enquiry was not noted in the judgment below. However, the court found that the supervisor at the booking station noted that the first appellant had been in the transit area for more than 24 hours and that she (the supervisor) duly notified the police in accordance with security procedures at the airport. The first appellant was then told that the police would arrive shortly to talk to him. He was found elsewhere in the transit area about 20 minutes later when the police arrived, and was taken back to the hotel. The first appellant was searched there. One of the items carried by him was a dark blue sling bag bearing the brand name “Converse”. The bag contained a red container bearing the brand name “Maltesers”, a pair of gloves, and a pair of shoes. 100 capsules were found inside the sling bag, as well as the Maltesers container, the gloves, and the shoes. Each of the 100 capsules containing diamorphine was found wrapped in layers of aluminium foil, plastic, and adhesive tape. When questioned by the police, the first appellant at first said that the capsules were chocolate, but when the question was repeated he said that they were African herbs that tasted like chocolate. He said that such herbs “gave strength” when eaten. He then swallowed a capsule, but that was subsequently retrieved from the first appellant at the hospital. The police suspected the content to be drugs when they cut open one of the capsules. The Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) was then alerted and it took over the investigation.For the reasons above, we dismissed both appeals.\n",

      "It should be noted, at the outset, that, unlike the provisions of the Act, s 1(1) of the 1964 UK Act was silent with respect to the issue as to whether or not mens rea was required; the word “knowingly” – and/or allied words – did not appear in the provision itself (this was particularly emphasised by Lord Guest in Warner at 300). It should also be noted that s 1(1) of the 1964 UK Act also expressly sets out exceptions under which the persons concerned could lawfully possess drugs – thus suggesting that all other situations would fall within the ambit of the provision, regardless of whether or not mens rea was present (a point emphasised, for example, by Lord Pearce and Lord Wilberforce in Warner at 304–305 and 312, respectively). However, it should also be noted that the reasoning of the various law lords (even amongst the majority) did differ. An excellent summary may in fact be found in the UK Law Commission’s Report on the Mental Element in Crime (Law Com No 89, 1978) (“Law Commission Report”) at paras 33–34, and we therefore do not propose to examine the various judgments in Warner in detail, save where certain passages might throw light on the interpretation of the Act. However, it should be noted that although the majority found that the offence concerned was an absolute one, it also held that the summing-up by the trial judge to the jury was wanting. The majority nevertheless proceeded to hold that the evidence was so strong that no jury properly directed would have acquitted the accused and therefore dismissed the accused’s appeal, applying the proviso to s 4(1) of the UK Criminal Appeal Act 1907 (c 23) (as amended by s 4 of the UK Criminal Appeal Act 1966 (c 31)).Turning to a consideration of ss 18(1) and 18(2) proper, it is clear, in our view, that the former deals with the concept of possession (often, but not invariably, physical in nature: see Van Damme Johannes ([60] supra) at [8]) whilst the latter deals with the knowledge of the nature of the thing possessed. The former is also a pre-requisite before the latter can be considered. Put simply, if no possession on the part of the accused is proved in the first instance, it is futile – indeed, illogical – to consider whether there is knowledge of the nature of the thing possessed (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of PP v Wong Wai Hung [1992] 2 SLR(R) 918, where the second accused was therefore acquitted). This interpretation is supported not only by the language of ss 18(1) and 18(2) but also by the heading of s 18 itself, which reads as follows: “Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs” [emphasis added] (see also above at [54]; and on the utility of headings and marginal notes generally, see the recent decision of this court in Tee Soon Kay v AG [2007] 3 SLR(R) 133 at [37]–[41]).

      "The appellant’s argument as outlined above was based on certain observations made by the judge who heard the magistrate’s appeal in Lim Boon Keong v PP [2010] 4 SLR 451 (“Lim Boon Keong”). We rejected the argument and dismissed the appeal.The appellant appealed against the trial judge’s decision. At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, we dismissed the appeal as there was, in our view, no reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence which he was convicted of. We also said that we would give our reasons for dismissing the appeal; we now set out those reasons.For the purposes of the present discussion, we shall assume that the MA judge’s observations on the effect of non-compliance with s 31(4)(b) are correct. (We are not, however, making any ruling or comments on the correctness of the MA judge’s observations on s 31(4)(b) as that issue is currently the subject of an on-going drug consumption trial in the High Court and, further, was not argued in full before us.) Proceeding on the aforesaid assumption, what is clear to us is that, vis-à-vis the offence of drug consumption specifically, if s 31(4)(b) has not been complied with, the Prosecution must prove actual consumption of the drug in question by the accused before he can be convicted of the offence. How can the Prosecution prove this fact (ie, the actus reus of the offence of drug consumption) in such a situation? As we see it, there are only two modes of proof (assuming, as just mentioned, that the MA judge’s observations on the effect of non-compliance with s 31(4)(b) are correct) – one way is by the accused admitting or confessing to the act of consumption, the other is by the Prosecution calling a witness who actually saw the accused consume the drug in question. In Lim Boon Keong ([6] supra), in the proceedings before the MA judge, the Prosecution relied solely on the s 122(6) confession made by Lim (reproduced at [9] above) as proof of consumption (cf the Prosecution’s case in the proceedings before the District Judge, where Ms Kuan’s s 16 MDA certificate and the s 22 MDA presumption were relied on as well (see [8] above)), but the MA judge rejected that confession on the ground of unreliability, having regard to the circumstances in which it was made.\n",

Accordingly, the Prosecution was held to have established its case beyond reasonable doubt (see [78] of the GD). The main reasons for rejecting the defence of consumption could be said to be as follows:\n",
      "(a)     The Appellant did not have the financial means to purchase half of the Packets, and there was no arrangement to pay Ah Long in instalments (see [35]–[46] and [73] of the GD).\n",
      "(b)     As the Appellant admitted that he had a ready supply or access to heroin, it was unlikely that he would have needed to stockpile 23 of the Packets for himself (see [47] and [73] of the GD).\n",
      "(c)     An adverse inference could justifiably be drawn against the Appellant, as he had failed to mention the defence of consumption in his long statements (see [65]–[70] and [74] of the GD).\n",

      "We dismissed this appeal because, having regard to the totality of the evidence adduced at the trial, the Judge was entitled to find that the appellant had actual knowledge that he was trafficking in cannabis and cannabis mixture. In particular, the Judge accepted as voluntary and true the appellant’s reply, “The ‘Grass’”, when the appellant was asked by a CNB officer what was in the sports bag. The Judge rejected the appellant’s explanation as to why he had answered “The ‘Grass’”, instead of maintaining his previous reply that he was not sure what was in the sports bag. The fact that the appellant had replied “The ‘Grass’” was not disputed by his counsel after taking instructions from him (see the GD at [54]). The appellant’s defence was that he answered “The ‘Grass’” because he had heard the CNB officers talking among themselves and saying that “grass” was inside the sports bag.At the conclusion of oral submissions before us, we dismissed the appeal. We now give our reasons.The Judge also made an alternative finding against the appellant. He found on the evidence that the appellant was wilfully blind as to what was contained in the sports bag.

The Judge was a member of the panel of the Court of Appeal in that case.

      "We appreciated the candour of counsel for the Appellant. On our part, we had examined the High Court GD and the evidence before the Judge, and were satisfied that the evidence was clear as to the Appellant’s: (a) possession of the diamorphine contained in the 136 Packets; (b) knowledge of the diamorphine; and (c) intention to traffic in the diamorphine. Thus, even without the aforesaid concession by the Appellant’s counsel, we would have dismissed this appeal because there was sufficient evidence to sustain the Appellant’s conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. These grounds of decision are issued primarily to clarify some parts of the High Court GD in so far as they relate to the application of the ss 17(c) and 18(2) presumptions. Specifically, we will address the issue of whether the Judge erred in his application of these presumptions (“Issue 1”). For completeness, we will also examine whether the Judge was right in finding that the Prosecution had proved the Charge against the Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt (“Issue 2”).Unlike the present case, it is clear that in Teo Yeow Chuah, the trial judge erroneously applied the then equivalent of the ss 17(c) and 18(2) presumptions conjunctively. Notwithstanding that error, this court, on hearing the appeal against the trial judge’s decision, dismissed the appeal as there was overwhelming evidence to conclude that the accused was in possession of the drugs in question for the purpose of trafficking in them (see Teo Yeow Chuah v Public Prosecutor [2004] 2 SLR(R) 563 at [34]–[36]).The Appellant’s “contemporaneous” statement mentioned at [14] above was recorded by a CNB officer (viz, Insp Eugene Tan) during the second half of the search of the Flat at around 3.20pm on 15 April 2009. The questioning was carried out in the Kitchen, with SSgt Ong acting as the escorting officer.[note: 20] In the court below, the Appellant contested the admissibility of his “contemporaneous” statement on the ground that CNB officers had no power in law to take statements from him. The Judge rightly dismissed this argument (at [11] of the High Court GD) because a CNB officer is clearly endowed, pursuant to s 32 of the Act, with all the powers that a police officer has under the CPC in relation to an investigation into a seizable offence. These powers include the power to take statements from an accused person pursuant to s 121 of the CPC (see Public Prosecutor v Azman bin Mohamed Sanwan and others [2010] SGHC 196 at [22]).\n",

We now give our grounds of decision.At [34] of Nagaenthran (HC), the Judge explained why he rejected the appellant’s defence of duress (a finding with which we agreed):Consequently, the s 18(2) presumption applied, and the appellant was presumed to have known the nature of the aforesaid (controlled) drug (which he was presumed to have had in his possession), unless he proved the contrary. He was again unable to do so because the Judge rejected his defence that he believed or thought that the Bundle contained “company product”, and found that he had actual knowledge that the Bundle contained heroin. We should add that the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA also applies to a case where the accused is proved to have been in possession of a controlled drug, eg, where the accused knew or was wilfully blind to the fact that he was carrying a controlled drug. Another illustration of proven possession, without the aid of the presumption in s 18(1) of the MDA, would be where the accused has direct possession of a controlled drug (as opposed to possession of something containing a controlled drug, the keys of something containing a controlled drug, etc), eg, where the accused has some white pills in his trouser pocket (whatever he believed them to be) that turn out to be a controlled drug. Ultimately, regardless of whether possession is proved or presumed, s 18(2) of the MDA would apply to presume that the accused knew the nature of that drug, unless he proves the contrary.\n",

      "The first appellant, Mdm Pang Siew Fum (“Pang”), a 56-year-old Malaysian, and the second appellant, Mr Cheong Chun Yin (“Cheong”), a 27-year-old Malaysian, were both convicted of trafficking in not less than 2,726g of diamorphine (“heroin”), and sentenced to death by Choo Han Teck J (“the Judge”) in Public Prosecutor v Pang Siew Fum and another [2010] SGHC 40 (“the Judgment”). Both of them appealed against their convictions and sentences. We heard and dismissed the appeals on 21 October 2010. We now give our reasons.In conclusion, we had no doubt that both Pang and Cheong knew that they were smuggling drugs. Their challenge in this appeal related to a finding of fact by the Judge, ie, that each of them had failed to rebut the presumption laid down in s 18(2). For the reasons discussed above, we were of the opinion that the Judge was eminently correct to hold that the s 18(2) presumption had not been rebutted. The appeals of Pang and Cheong were therefore dismissed.\n",

      "Regina v Harrow Crown Court, Ex parte Dave [1994] 1 WLR 98 (“Ex parte Dave”) exemplifies the importance of having reasons adequately stated. The applicant brought an appeal to the Crown Court against her conviction by justices for an offence of assault. The appeal was dismissed. The Crown Court simply stated: “[o]ver the course of three days we have had ample opportunity to hear and to assess the witnesses. It is our unanimous conclusion that this appeal must be dismissed” (Ex parte Dave at 102H). The applicant sought judicial review to quash the decision of the Crown Court. The application was granted by the Queen’s Bench Division, which held that, in principle, enough must be said “to demonstrate that the court has identified the main contentious issues in the case and how it has resolved each of them” (Ex parte Dave at 107A). Although “[e]laborate reasoning was not required” (Ex parte Dave at 107B), the statement made by the Crown Court was clearly inadequate because effectively no reason was given. Against the holding of the Crown Court, one may argue that it was implicit in the dismissal of the applicant’s appeal that there was a finding by the Crown Court that it accepted the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses. But this argument is clearly flawed, because if it is taken to its logical conclusion, no reason needs ever be stated, since it would be implicit in every decision that the judge has accepted the evidence adduced by the party he has ruled in favour of.We also note that the duty has been held not to apply to certain matters of lesser significance. For example, there are some types of interlocutory applications, mainly those with a procedural focus, which a judge can properly make an order without giving reasons: see Capital and Suburban Properties Ltd v Swycher [1976] Ch 319 at 325–326 (per Buckley LJ) and Knight v Clifton [1971] Ch 700 at 721. Buckley LJ had in mind instances where the judge is asked to exercise his discretion on relatively insignificant questions, such as whether a matter should be expedited or adjourned or extra time should be allowed for a party to take some procedural step, or possibly whether relief by way of injunction should be granted or refused. Neither are reasons normally to be expected when a judge exercises his discretion on costs, unless it involves an unusual award: see Eagil Trust Co Ltd v Pigott-Brown [1985] 3 All ER 119 at 122. It appears that many of these exceptions involve a large element of discretion. However, we do not think that it is their discretionary nature per se which justifies the dispensation of any explanation. Rather, it seems that these exceptions are allowed because they are not decisions that bear directly on substantive matters. For example, even in matters of practice and procedure, where the decision will effectively decide the rights of the parties finally, reasons must be given: see Glen Rees T/as Glynmar Pastoral Co v Walker (13 December 1988) (New South Wales Court of Appeal) (per Kirby P). However, we would caution against equating non-substantive cases as being necessarily insignificant. The court’s assessment of the significance of a decision should take into account the circumstances of the case, and its importance should not be judged simply by categorising the decision as being substantive or procedural in nature. As a rule of thumb, the more profound the consequences of a decision are, the greater the necessity for detailed reasoning.Secondly, the statement should briefly set out the parties’ opposing stances,  and  set out the facts found by the judge, both primary and inferential. For example, in Craven v Craven, the English Court of Appeal ordered a new trial in a divorce case because the judge at first instance had dismissed the wife’s charge of cruelty without making any finding as to whether, on a material occasion, she had been deliberately or accidentally hit by her husband.\n",

      "Another ground based on which Mr Wong sought to challenge Sng’s conviction was that the Prosecution violated Art 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”) in charging Sng with a capital offence and Choong Peng with a non-capital offence when the charges arose from the same events that led to both men (among others) being arrested on 23 January 2008.[note: 45] This argument was recently rejected by this court in Ramalingam Ravinthran v AG, and we do not propose to repeat what this court stated at [70]–[72] of that judgment. As Mr Wong was unable to substantiate his case that the Attorney-General, in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor, had exercised his prosecutorial discretion based on irrelevant considerations, we dismiss this argument.The above arguments of Chan and Sng were rejected by the trial judge (“the Judge”), who convicted the two men of the respective capital charges brought against them (see Public Prosecutor v Sng Chun Heng and another [2011] 3 SLR 437 (“the GD”)). Both Chan and Sng appealed. The appeal was heard on 16 March 2011, at the end of which we reserved judgment. On 7 April 2011, counsel for Sng, Mr Wong Siew Hong (“Mr Wong”), obtained leave to file further written submissions, which submissions were subsequently filed on 20 April 2011. The Prosecution’s reply to Sng’s further written submissions was filed on 3 May 2011. As one of the central arguments made by Mr Wong – viz, that relating to the exercise of the Attorney-General’s prosecutorial discretion (see [16] below at sub-para (c) as well as [40] below) – had also been raised in Criminal Motion No 60 of 2011 (“CM 60/2011”), we deferred the determination of this appeal until we had decided the outcome of CM 60/2011 (see Ramalingam Ravinthran v Attorney-General [2012] SGCA 2 (“Ramalingam Ravinthran v AG”) for our decision on that matter).This argument was dealt with quite extensively by the Judge and we see no reason to disturb his decision to reject it.

      "We do not think that these statutory presumptions can be applied against the Appellant in view of our ruling that P97 and P132 are inadmissible. The reason is that without the evidence contained in P97 and P132, the Prosecution’s case against the Appellant is now no different from that against Tamil and, in particular, Bala, both of whom were acquitted by the Trial Judge with no appeals by the Prosecution therefrom. Admittedly, the Appellant was, in the words of s 21 of the MDA (2001 Ed), “in charge of” SGT 809 X – viz, the vehicle in which the cannabis was found when the Appellant, Tamil and Bala were arrested – at the material time. However, this was fortuitous in that the evidence at [6]–[7] above shows that:\n",
      "(a)     the cannabis was initially in SCQ 143 X, which was not under the charge of the Appellant at the material time (as mentioned at [5] above, Tamil borrowed SCQ 143 X from Sundrammurthy upon reaching the Yishun car park on the morning of 28 April 2007);\n",
      "(b)     the cannabis was then moved to SGT 809 X; and\n",
      "(c)     shortly thereafter, the Appellant, Tamil and Bala were arrested by the CNB surveillance officers.Given that the Trial Judge found that there was insufficient basis for him to apply the statutory presumptions of possession and knowledge against Bala, the Appellant should not be in any worse position than Bala – absent the evidence in P97 and P132 – merely because the Appellant, Tamil and Bala were arrested only after the cannabis had been moved from SCQ 143 X to SGT 809 X. We might have been more prepared to apply the relevant statutory presumptions against the Appellant had the cannabis been placed directly in SGT 809 X from the outset, but that was not the case here. Further, just as Bala had possession of the cannabis for only a “short period of time” (see the Judgment at [145]), the position was the same vis-à-vis the Appellant as he (along with Tamil and Bala) was arrested shortly after the cannabis was moved to SGT 809 X. It can thus equally be said of the Appellant that, just as in Bala’s case, “[t]he events from the retrieval of the bundles in [the] bag [ie, the blue paper bag recovered from the boot of SGT 809 X (see [7] above)] to the arrest took place too quickly for him to make enquiries or to examine the bundles” (see the Judgment at [146]). In the circumstances, we see no reason why the law should find against the Appellant when Tamil and Bala were acquitted by the Trial Judge. Whatever its reasons might be, the Prosecution has not appealed against Tamil’s and Bala’s acquittals. We are thus placed in the difficult position of having to treat those acquittals as correct in law, and to assess the Appellant’s culpability on precisely the same evidential scales as those employed by the Trial Judge to acquit Tamil and Bala. After careful consideration, we cannot say that the evidence on record reveals that the Appellant is any more culpable than Tamil and Bala (who were both acquitted), especially given that traces of cannabis were found in Bala’s urine whereas no trace was found in the Appellant’s urine. We also note that unlike the Appellant, Tamil has an antecedent. Having said that, we are, as just mentioned, constrained by the Prosecution’s stance (in not pursuing appeals in respect of the Trial Judge’s decision to acquit Tamil and Bala) to deem Tamil’s and Bala’s acquittals correct in law, and, accordingly, we shall make no further comment in that regard. We would only mention that the evidence suggests that as between the Appellant, Tamil and Bala, one or more (or possibly all) of them knew that the blue paper bag recovered from the boot of SGT 809 X contained cannabis or, at the very least, some form of controlled drug. However, the evidence against the Appellant specifically is flawed, and we find it unsafe, based on such evidence, to convict him of the capital charge brought against him.This is an appeal brought by Azman bin Mohamed Sanwan (“the Appellant”) against the decision of a High Court judge (“the Trial Judge”) convicting him of a capital charge brought under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the MDA (2001 Ed)”) while acquitting his two co-accused, namely, Tamil Salvem (“Tamil”) and Balasubramaniam s/o Murugesan (“Bala”), of the same capital charge (see Public Prosecutor v Azman bin Mohamed Sanwan [2010] SGHC 196 (“the Judgment”)) (the offence which the Appellant was charged with was allegedly committed on 28 April 2007, before the current version of the Misuse of Drugs Act (ie, the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)) came into force).

      "In Pradumna Shriniwas Auradkar v State of Maharashtra 1981 Cri L J 1873, the applicant, A, argued that he could not be convicted of criminal conspiracy as his only co-conspirator, B, was acquitted of the same offence. In dismissing the appeal, similar to the present case, the court held at [11] that the conspiracy had been clearly established on the facts and as the acquittal of B was on a purely technical ground, the appellant could not be exonerated in the circumstances. The court also held that to prove criminal conspiracy, it was unnecessary that the co-conspirator be tried and/or convicted. Crucially, as no authority had been presented to suggest that A should be acquitted ipso facto, following from B’s acquittal, his conviction could not be challenged. As such, the acquittal of B per se did not affect A’s conviction under the criminal conspiracy charge. One must however note that it is the reason supporting the acquittal of a co-accused that the court must pay attention to.Accordingly, the Judge acquitted Somchit of the original charge. However, exercising his power under s 175(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), the Judge amended the charge against Somchit and convicted her of attempting to traffic in a controlled drug under Class C of the First Schedule of the Act (“the separate charge”). On 2 September 2010, Somchit was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment.In the House of Lords decision in Director of Public Prosecutions v Shannon [1975] AC 717, a similar issue was canvassed wherein the conviction of the accused person was challenged on the basis that his co-conspirator had been acquitted. The appellant argued that at least two persons must be proved to be guilty of the same criminal conspiracy before anyone could be convicted of the same. The argument that “if A and B alone were indicted together and ‘tried together’ for conspiracy ... that ‘both must be convicted or both must be acquitted’” was considered by their Lordships at 722.

      "The Judge acquitted Mas Swan of the joint charge and convicted Roshamima of the following amended charge (“the amended charge”):The Judge acquitted Mas Swan of the charge of importing diamorphine (viz, the joint charge mentioned at [1] above) as he was satisfied that Mas Swan had rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) that he knew that the three bundles contained diamorphine. He gave the following reasons for his finding:\n",
      "(a)     Mas Swan’s consistent evidence in both his statements and his oral testimony in court was that he believed that the three bundles that he was delivering for Mickey contained ecstasy pills.\n",
      "(b)     The Judge preferred Mas Swan’s evidence to Roshamima’s evidence because his evidence was more consistent than hers and was also self-incriminating.\n",
      "(c)     It was Roshamima who had inducted Mas Swan into the drug delivery racket. She had been delivering bundles before Mas Swan. Mas Swan was therefore aware that Roshamima had knowledge of the drug deliveries.\n",
      "(d)     Mas Swan’s role in and knowledge of the drug deliveries was limited. The Judge observed that Mas Swan was “mild-mannered and somewhat timid”, whereas Roshamima had “an assertive and dominant personality”. Mas Swan’s role was simply to accompany Roshamima. The Judge also noted that when Mas Swan and Roshamima were detained at Woodlands Checkpoint, all calls from Murie and Mickey were made to Roshamima’s mobile phone, indicating that Mas Swan’s role and knowledge was limited. On every occasion involving the delivery of bundles, it was usually Roshamima who would inform Mas Swan of the availability of a “segmen”, ie, the availability of ecstasy pills for delivery to Singapore.\n",
      "(e)     Mas Swan had no reason to disbelieve Roshamima’s information that the three bundles contained ecstasy pills. He was to be engaged to marry Roshamima, and would have had no reason to disbelieve what she told him.\n",
      "(f)     The Prosecution did not challenge the veracity of Mas Swan’s statements or his oral evidence that he believed that the three bundles contained ecstasy pills. In fact, it appeared from the Prosecution’s questions during cross-examination that the Prosecution accepted Mas Swan’s testimony that he believed that the three bundles contained ecstasy. From the manner in which the Prosecution conducted its case, it appeared to the Judge that the Prosecution was not challenging Mas Swan’s belief, but rather, was attempting to persuade the court that the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA (“the s 18(2) presumption”) was not rebutted because Mas Swan was wilfully blind to the nature of the controlled drugs in the three bundles.\n",
      "(g)     Mas Swan was not wilfully blind to the nature of the controlled drugs in the three bundles. Although Mas Swan had testified that the nature of the controlled drugs did not matter to him, he had consistently maintained that he honestly believed that the three bundles contained ecstasy pills. The fact that Mas Swan had opportunities to inspect the three bundles was not sufficient to prove wilful blindness.The Prosecution’s sentencing precedents consist of Khor Soon Lee and several unreported District Court decisions on sentencing for the offence of importing either ecstasy or “Yaba” (Yaba is the street name of a methamphetamine-based drug). These cases are, in brief, as follows:\n",
      "(a)      Public Prosecutor v Chew Wee Kiat District Arrest Case No 2443 of 2001 and Magistrate’s Appeal No 175 of 2001 (“Chew Wee Kiat”): The accused was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint with 1,399 ecstasy tablets. The net weight of N, α-dimethyl-3,4-(methylenedioxy) phenethylamine (“MDMA”) in the consignment was 194.63g. The accused was convicted after a trial and was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane. He was a first offender. The accused filed a notice of appeal, but subsequently withdrew it.\n",
      "(b)      Public Prosecutor v Teo Leong Huat District Arrest Case No 35110 of 2001 (“Teo Leong Huat”): The accused arrived in Singapore on a flight from Brussels. Officers from the CNB kept him under surveillance and subsequently arrested him. A black bag was recovered from him. The bag contained 15,070 ecstasy tablets, which, upon analysis, were found to contain 2,129.2g of MDMA. The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of importing the ecstasy tablets and was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane for that charge.\n",
      "(c)      Public Prosecutor v Robin Unggul Suryono District Arrest Case No 3409 of 2011 (“Robin Unggul Suryono”): The accused was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint with 3,061 ecstasy tablets and two small sachets of powder in his possession. The tablets and the sachets were analysed and were found to contain 190.45g of MDMA. The accused claimed that he was bringing the drugs from Malaysia through Singapore en route to Indonesia, and that the proceeds from his drug activities would go towards helping the poor in Indonesia. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.\n",
      "(d)      Khor Soon Lee: On appeal to this court, the appellant in this case was acquitted of the capital charge of importing not less than 27.86g of diamorphine and convicted of an amended charge of attempting to import Class A controlled drugs other than diamorphine (see [24] above). A review of the facts set out in Khor Soon Lee (which, as mentioned earlier, dealt only with this court’s reasons for acquitting the appellant of the capital charge of importing diamorphine) suggests that the particular controlled drugs that the appellant thought he was importing were ketamine, ecstasy, “Ice” (ie, methamphetamine) and “Erimin” (ie, nimetazepam, a Class C controlled drug) (see Khor Soon Lee at sub-para (a) of [21] for the court’s definition of the term “Controlled Drugs”). The appellant was sentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane for the offence of attempted importation. No written grounds were issued by the court vis-à-vis its decision to convict the appellant of that offence and to impose the aforesaid sentence on him.\n",

A discretion in the prosecuting authority to prosecute for a more serious offence rather than for a less serious one is not open to any constitutional objection (see Lord Diplock in Teh Cheng Poh alias Char Meh v Public Prosecutor, Malaysia [1980] AC 458 at 474–475) unless it is in breach of Art 12 of the Constitution (which has not been alleged in this case). Even if s 53 of the MDA were declared unconstitutional, it would only have meant that the District Court could not impose punishments beyond its ordinary sentencing jurisdiction under s 303(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of 2010) (“the CPC 2010”) (which is up to ten years’ imprisonment).

      "The Judge found the evidence-gathering procedure for the purposes of applying s 33B to be fraught with difficulty. On the one hand, if he allowed new evidence to be introduced, there was a possibility of evidence emerging that might undermine the findings of fact that he had made earlier in convicting Chum. On the other hand, if he did not allow the introduction of new evidence, and premised his decision exclusively on his findings of fact which had resulted in the conviction, Chum might be prejudiced in that his earlier defence for the purposes of conviction might have been conducted in a manner which furnished no occasion for evidence of his being no more than a courier to emerge at trial.However, the court obviously retains the discretion to refuse to hear criminal references in appropriate circumstances. An example of a case where a criminal reference may be inappropriately brought and accordingly dismissed is Mohammad Faizal bin Sabtu v PP [2013] 2 SLR 141, where this court dismissed two criminal motions on two separate questions of law because, amongst other reasons, the court below had not made a final ruling or imposed a sentence and allowing the motions in those circumstances “would lead to an unnecessary and unacceptable disruption to the final disposal of both matters” (at [27]). Although I do have some reservations with the necessity of the two references now before the court (see [69] below), they do not cause unnecessary or unacceptable disruption to the final disposal of the underlying matters. I will therefore proceed to answer the three questions.I am cognisant that there is a view that an accused person has a choice between coming clean and stating from the beginning that he was a courier (not just in the sense that he was a courier of a generic parcel but that he was a courier of the controlled drugs), and “playing games” with the Prosecution by sticking to one of the three primary defences without admitting that he was a courier. Under this view, if the court disbelieves his primary defence, he should not be allowed to invoke the statutory relief of being a courier.

This leads us to our third observation, which, although trite, bears repeating – that it must be shown that a trial judge’s determination was plainly wrong or plainly against the weight of the evidence before appellate intervention is warranted. This appeal neatly illustrated this principle – while there were certain gaps in the Respondent’s defence, especially given the fact that there was no objective or corroborating evidence from another party in support of the Respondent’s defence, we were not satisfied that the Judge was plainly wrong in his findings and therefore dismissed the appeal.As already mentioned, we will return to elaborate on these three observations later, but first set out our detailed grounds for dismissing the appeal.\n",

      "The Judge convicted the Appellant and sentenced him to death. The grounds for the Judge’s decision are reported as PP v Devendran A/L Supramaniam [2014] SGHC 140 (“the GD”). His reasons can be stated in brief as follows:\n",
      "(a)     The actus reus of the offence was made out (the GD at [26]).\n",
      "(b)     To establish the mens rea of the offence, the Prosecution relied on the presumptions in ss 18 and 21 of the MDA. The first was that the Appellant was presumed to have been in possession of the diamorphine because it was found in his motorcycle seat, pursuant to either s 18(1)(a) or s 21. The second, following on from the first, was that the Appellant was presumed to have known the nature of the diamorphine by virtue of having the diamorphine in his possession (the GD at [27]).\n",
      "(c)     The Appellant contested the second presumption. He had to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he had no knowledge that the bundles contained diamorphine (the GD at [28]).\n",
      "(d)     The Alagendran Theory was unpersuasive. This is for two reasons:\n",
      "(i)       First, the story was likely an afterthought. The Appellant only mentioned the events relating to Alagendran on 15 November 2011, around six months after he was arrested. This was despite the fact that the events surrounding Alagendran happened on 11 May 2011, one day before his arrest, and should have been fresh in his mind upon arrest (the GD at [30]–[31]).\n",
      "(ii)       Second, the story itself was incredible. It was unexplained why the motorcycle had to be repaired with such urgency. Furthermore, the Appellant never arranged to meet Alagendran in Singapore, and hence it could not have been the case that Alagendran was making use of the Appellant to transport the drugs. The only other possible explanation, that Alagendran was trying to frame the Appellant, was even more incredible. The Appellant gave no evidence indicating any reason or motive on the part of Alagendran in wanting to set him up. In fact, the Appellant’s evidence pointed at an amicable relationship between them (the GD at [32]–[34]).\n",
      "(e)     The Kumar Theory was similarly unpersuasive. This is for two reasons.\n",
      "(i)       First, there were significant omissions in the Appellant’s evidence, which caused the Judge to disbelieve the theory. The Appellant did not name either Kumar or Gobi in his cautioned statement, which was recorded on the day of his arrest. He only referred to three different individuals, “a friend of mine”, “another friend”, and “a man”. On hindsight, the first was Agilan, the second was Suria, and the third was likely Kumar. Not only was Kumar not named, Gobi was not even referred to. In his statements on 14 and 15 May 2011, the Appellant referred to “an unknown character”. Only in his statement on 16 May 2011 did he identify this character as Gobi. When he did so, he stated that he knew the person was Gobi because when he spoke to him over the phone, Gobi told the Appellant his name. The Appellant explained that he left Gobi out because he did not want to implicate him in this case. This was despite the fact that the Appellant had first met Gobi only ten days before his arrest although he had known Kumar for four years. Also, after the Appellant gave the contact details of Gobi to the CNB officer, CNB located the user of the phone number and obtained his photograph. The Appellant was asked to identify Gobi from a series of photographs (which included the person who was the owner of that contact number) but was unable to do so (the GD at [35]–[43]).\n",
      "(ii)       Second, the theory was rife with suspicious circumstances. First, the Appellant simply allowed Kumar to take his motorcycle, worth about RM2,500, for about two hours in the night of 11 May 2011, without any assurance it would have been returned. Second, the Appellant never questioned why he had to ride the motorcycle into Singapore to pass it to Kumar, as opposed to simply allowing Kumar to ride the motorcycle into Singapore. Third, the Appellant did not check the seat of the motorcycle when he felt the unusual hardness upon the motorcycle being returned to him by Kumar. This failure to check was especially suspicious given that the Appellant knew he was going to ride the motorcycle into Singapore, and ought to have ensured that there were no contraband items or drugs hidden therein. The Appellant’s reasons for not checking – that it was late, and he was more concerned about his step-brother – were unpersuasive as a check would not have taken much time.\n",
      "(f)     As neither theory was made out, the Appellant failed to rebut the presumption under s 18(2).\n",
      "(g)     Even if the Kumar Theory were to be true, the Appellant was wilfully blind towards the presence of diamorphine in the motorcycle seat. Such wilful blindness, premised on the Appellant’s failure to check the motorcycle seat despite the suspicious circumstances, was proven beyond reasonable doubt. As wilful blindness equates to actual knowledge, this satisfies the mens rea of the offence (the GD at [50]–[53]).\n",
      "(h)     The Appellant’s incriminating statements recorded on 15 and 16 May, in which he evinced a desire to plead guilty and stated that he was ready to face death, confirmed his guilt. Neither of these statements was recorded involuntarily.Having dealt with the three preliminary issues, we propose to analyse the key points of Mr Wong’s case. To recapitulate, he was not running a positive case before us. Rather, he sought to raise “alternative theories” to explain how the drugs could have made their way into the seat of the Appellant’s motorcycle. All these theories had been raised before, and considered by, the Judge. As such, the burden he faced was not simply to convince us of those theories, but to satisfy us that the Judge had wrongly rejected them.In the result, we find that the Judge was correct in dismissing either theory as implausible. We note that there are further suspicious circumstances that justify the Judge’s finding that the Appellant was indeed wilfully blind.\n",

      "Both the Respondent and Hamidah claimed trial. Both denied knowledge of the Drugs in the Black Luggage. On 5 November 2014, the trial judge (“the Judge”) acquitted the Respondent and convicted Hamidah. His written grounds of decision are reported at Public Prosecutor v Hamidah Binte Awang and another [2015] SGHC 4 (“the GD”).It appears to us that that the Respondent has a habit of fashioning his own defence as he goes along, depending on how the winds of evidence are blowing. Not only had he lied in the First Statement, he had also not been truthful about why he lied. To add on to this, there are also no good reasons for his inconsistent explanations. In Mas Swan, one of the appellants (one Roshamima) was facing a charge of importation of diamorphine. Her primary defence was that she had no knowledge of the drugs that were in her possession. Her alternative (and inconsistent) defence was that she believed that the drugs were ecstasy. This court found that it was not unreasonable that she had chosen not to rely on her alternative defence at trial because it might have impacted on the cogency or strength of her primary defence, which might have acquitted her (Mas Swan at [68]). Thus the court set aside Roshamima’s conviction of importing diamorphine and convicted her on the amended charge of attempting to import ecstasy instead. In the present case there was no such similar option available to the Respondent, except that he appears to have taken a particular position based on what seemed to him most believable at the time. This is not the behaviour of a credible witness.In the result, and having regard to the totality of the evidence as discussed above, we are convinced and find that the Respondent has not rebutted the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA. While we are mindful of the advantages that the Judge as a trier of fact has, we are driven to the conclusion that the Judge ought to have rejected the Respondent’s defence, which is in the final analysis an unlikely account from an unreliable source. The Judge’s acquittal of the Respondent is wrong and against the weight of the evidence. Accordingly, we allow the appeal, and convict the Respondent on the charge preferred against him.\n",

      "Both the Applicant and Somchit claimed trial in the High Court. On 2 September 2010, after a 17-day trial, the High Court judge (“the Judge”) convicted both the Applicant and Somchit, albeit on different charges from the original charge preferred against them. The Judge acquitted Somchit of the original charge on the basis of his finding that on a balance of probabilities she did not have knowledge of the nature of the drug that was the subject of the charge. Instead, the Judge convicted Somchit on a lesser charge of attempting to traffic in a controlled drug classified as a Class C drug in the First Schedule to the MDA, and sentenced her to nine years’ imprisonment.The Applicant appealed against his conviction and sentence vide CCA 20/2010 on two separate grounds, which were both dismissed by this court on 9 April 2012. First, he argued that the Judge had erred in law in proceeding to hear the charge against him after he had pleaded guilty to the amended charge, in that the Judge had failed to follow the procedural safeguards set out in ss 139 and 187 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) in relation to the recording of his plea of guilt. This ground of appeal was rejected by this court, since what had in fact transpired was that the Judge had rejected the Applicant’s guilty plea and offered him the opportunity to call such witnesses as he might wish in his defence. The approach taken by the Judge did not cause the Applicant any prejudice.The Applicant had been tried and convicted in the High Court on a charge of engaging in a criminal conspiracy to traffic a controlled drug under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) (see PP v Phuthita Somchit [2011] 3 SLR 719). The mandatory punishment under the charge was the death penalty. The Applicant’s appeal against his conviction and sentence vide CCA 20/2010 was dismissed by this court in Quek Hock Lye v PP [2012] 2 SLR 1012. Subsequently, the Applicant brought the present application to set aside the death sentence imposed on him on the basis that s 27(6) of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 30 of 2012) (“the Amendment Act”) is inconsistent with Art 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”).\n",

      "After hearing the parties’ arguments, we dismissed both the application for leave to adduce further evidence and the appeal. These are our reasons.The Judge rejected the evidence given by the Appellant at the voir dire on the grounds that it was inconsistent (see Public Prosecutor v Abdul Kahar bin Othman [2013] SGHC 164 (“Abdul Kahar (Conviction)”) at [7]). He noted that the Appellant first claimed that the admissions in his statements had been induced by threats that his mother would be implicated if he did not admit to the offences. He thereafter claimed that the statements had been fabricated by ASP Tang and Mdm Sofia. He finally said that ASP Tang had asked him some questions which he had answered, and ASP Tang had then recorded those answers in the statements. The Judge also observed that the statements made by the Appellant were interspersed with specific details about his family which could only have come from him and not from ASP Tang. The Judge therefore preferred and accepted ASP Tang’s evidence that the recording of the statements was routine, and that the statements had been given voluntarily by the Appellant.First, the Judge noted that the Appellant had not given any satisfactory explanation as to why Latif needed him to safekeep two bags of the size of A1 and A2 when both bags “could have easily been carried by Latif” (see Abdul Kahar (Conviction) at [8]). Second, the Judge rejected the Appellant’s evidence that A1 and A2 had not been concealed in a cavity in the cupboard mentioned at [9] above, but had instead been found in a drawer in that cupboard (see Abdul Kahar (Conviction) at [9]). The Judge preferred the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses that the two bags had indeed been concealed in a cavity in the cupboard. In this regard, he noted that the CNB officers had, in the Appellant’s presence, taken photographs of the place where A1 and A2 were found, and reasoned that if the two bags had indeed been found in the drawer mentioned by the Appellant, the Appellant would have indicated that to the CNB officers when they were photographing the scene. However, he did not do so. Third, the Judge held that if the Appellant truly did not know that A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 contained drugs, it did not make sense for him not to say anything or explain himself when confronted with the drugs in his car and at the Flat (see Abdul Kahar (Conviction) at [11]). Fourth, the Judge was of the view that the Appellant had not satisfactorily explained why traces of his DNA were found on (inter alia) the interior surface of A1 (see Abdul Kahar (Conviction) at [9]). Fifth, the Judge held that the Appellant had not given a satisfactory explanation as to why he had approximately $70,000 in cash in his bedroom, how there came to be a sum of approximately $100,000 in Mdm Bibah’s bank account and why Mdm Bibah’s bank passbook was found in his bedroom (see Abdul Kahar (Conviction) at [12]). Sixth, the Judge found that the Appellant’s cautioned statements indicated guilt on his part (see Abdul Kahar (Conviction) at [13]).\n",

      "These two appeals were against the decision of the trial judge in PP v Masoud Rahimi bin Mehrzad [2015] SGHC 288 (“the HC Judgment”) which involved a joint trial of two persons, Masoud Rahimi bin Mehrzad (“Masoud”) and Mogan Raj Terapadisamy (“Mogan”). We dismissed both appeals at the conclusion of the hearing and we now set out the reasons for our decision.Masoud and Mogan were jointly tried on two charges each for offences under the MDA. In respect of Masoud, the first charge alleged that he had possession of not less than 31.14g of diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking. The second charge alleged that he had possession of 77g of methamphetamine for the purposes of trafficking. In respect of Mogan, the first charge alleged that he had trafficked in not less than 14.99g of diamorphine. The second charge alleged that he had trafficked in 77g of methamphetamine. Both charges related to his act of handing over the black bundle to Masoud. After their convictions on their respective first charges, the Prosecution decided against further prosecution in relation to the charges involving methamphetamine and the Judge ordered a discharge not amounting to an acquittal of those two charges pursuant to s 232(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).The appellant in Dinesh Pillai No 1 subsequently applied to set aside his conviction and sentence. He argued, inter alia, that there was a fundamental error in this court’s decision in Dinesh Pillai No 1 because the High Court’s decision was affirmed on the ground that the appellant was careless, negligent or reckless in not checking the packet to see what was in it and such carelessness, negligence or recklessness did not constitute knowledge. In Dinesh Pillai No 2, this court rejected the appellant’s argument on the basis that it was entirely misplaced. The real issue was not what the appellant knew or did not know was in the packet. Rather, the material issue was whether the appellant had rebutted the s 18(2) presumption on a balance of probabilities (at [11]). On that basis, this court held that the s 18(2) presumption could not be rebutted if the accused made no effort to find out what he was bringing into Singapore in circumstances which would have alerted a reasonable person that he was being asked to do something illegal (at [11]). We pause again to note that counsel for Mogan also took issue with this part of the court’s judgment.\n",

      "The first charge is a capital offence, while the second and third charges are non-capital offences each carrying a minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. At the conclusion of the trial, the Judge convicted the Appellant on all three charges. As the Appellant came within the terms of s 33B of the MDA, the Judge exercised his discretion not to impose the death penalty on the first charge. The final sentence imposed on the Appellant was life imprisonment together with 24 strokes of the cane in respect of the three charges. This appeal concerns only the Appellant’s conviction on the three charges. The majority decision of this court is to allow the appeal and to acquit the Appellant on the three charges. I hold a contrary view and would dismiss the appeal for the reasons set out in this judgment.The majority decision of this court is that the Appellant should be acquitted on the ground that he has succeeded in rebutting the said presumption on a balance of probabilities. I respectfully disagree with this. After studying the evidence and the arguments, I am convinced that the conviction by the Judge was correct and should be affirmed. I now set out my reasons.In this appeal, the Appellant is appealing only against his conviction. In his petition of appeal, the Appellant submits that the Judge erred in the following ways:\n",

      "(c)     in failing to take into account the fact that the Appellant was not paid for the intended delivery of the Bundles (para 4(b));\n",
      "(d)     in finding that the presence of the Appellant’s DNA on the adhesive side of the tape used to wrap A2 was “the most incriminating evidence” (para 5);\n",
      "(e)     in finding that there were sufficient suspicious circumstances to require the Appellant to ask Mogan what was in the Bundles (para 6);\n",
      "(f)     in failing to take into account or give sufficient weight to the fact that what the Appellant stated in the eight statements which he made to the CNB officers after his arrest was consistent with his denial of any knowledge of the drugs (para 8);\n",
      "(g)     in failing to give sufficient weight to the Appellant’s evidence that he had a sufficient level of trust in Mogan (para 9);\n",
      "(h)     in failing to give sufficient reasons as to why the Appellant’s defence was rejected (paras 10–11); and\n",

      "We pause to note that the Appellant had chosen to act in person for the appeal, and had discharged the two free legal counsel assigned to him under the Legal Assistance Scheme for Capital Offences. At trial, the Appellant had already been assigned, and then discharged, a total of four other free legal counsel. At the hearing before us, the Appellant applied for the same two counsel, who were in attendance, to assist him as McKenzie friends (ie, persons present in court to advise and explain things to the Appellant, but not to represent him). We allowed the application.Having considered the matter, we have decided to dismiss the appeal for the reasons that follow.The Judge referred, in particular, to the DNA evidence found on various items that pointed to the Appellant’s guilt. This included the presence of the Appellant’s DNA on the interior and exterior of the plastic bags found in the Car and in the Flat and which contained the drugs, as well as the several drug paraphernalia found in the Flat. The Appellant’s DNA was also found on the heat sealer which had been used to heat-seal the plastic packets containing the drugs found in both the Flat and the Car. The Judge also rejected the Appellant’s allegations that he was framed by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”), or that the drugs were planted in the Car and in the Flat by various different people whom he had accused, at different points during the trial, of having done that. The Judge viewed these allegations as “a desperate attempt” by the Appellant to distance himself from the drugs found in the Car and in the Flat (the GD at [43] and [47]–[48]).\n",

      "In brief, we are of the view that Liew Zheng Yang was correctly decided. In our judgment, a person incurs no criminal liability under s 5 read with s 12 of the MDA for abetting another to traffic drugs to himself if the drugs were intended for his own consumption, that is, if he was a consuming-recipient. He will be so liable only if the Prosecution is able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended the offending drugs to be passed on from himself to someone else, that is, that he himself intended to traffic in the offending drugs. As it turns out, Ali can derive no assistance from this rule because he is unable to establish his case that half the diamorphine in the Bundle was for his and Selamat’s own consumption. In addition, even if he were able to establish such a case, it would assist neither of them because there is no such thing as a joint personal consumption defence: each accused person must be treated individually and independently for the purpose of the charge which has been brought against him, and therefore the amount that Ali intended to consume cannot be credited to Selamat, and vice versa, for the purpose of either of their attempts to establish that the portion of the diamorphine intended for personal consumption takes its total quantity below the amount warranting capital punishment. We are satisfied, moreover, that the evidence led by the Prosecution establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Ali, Selamat and Ragunath are guilty of the charges on which they have been convicted. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals. We turn now to explain our decision.First, the Judge rejected their claim that they consumed about 6g to 8g of heroin a day (Judgment at [10]). He regarded their evidence as to their rates of consumption as comprising bare assertions. Further, the report prepared by their psychiatrist, Dr Munidasa Winslow (“Dr Winslow”), stating that Selamat and Ali were heavy consumers of heroin, did not prove these rates because (a) it was mainly based on Selamat’s and Ali’s uncorroborated evidence; and (b) Dr Winslow himself accepted that the correlation between the amount of drugs consumed and the consumer’s withdrawal symptoms was of a general nature and could vary between individuals.Selamat also argues that the charge against him is defective as it fails to specify that he intended to transport the drugs to another person. Next, he relies on two facts which he submits are independently sufficient to rebut the presumption under s 17(c) of the MDA that he was in possession of the heroin in the Bundle for the purpose of trafficking. The first is the fact that his only purpose for being in possession of the Bundle was to obtain drugs from Ali for his personal consumption. The second is the fact that he did not know how much of the Bundle was meant for sale and how much was for consumption, given that it was Ali who was in control of and who decided such matters, as the Judge had found (see the Judgment at [16]). In addition, Selamat submits that the Judge erred in rejecting Ali’s and Selamat’s claim that half of the Bundle was for their personal consumption because the Judge (a) gave insufficient weight to their evidence of their own rates of drug consumption; (b) wrongly rejected Dr Winslow’s expert report, against which no rebuttal report had been adduced by the Prosecution; and (c) gave undue weight to the accounting deficit in respect of the single Bundle in question.\n",

      "We make two observations about the Prosecution’s case:\n",
      "(a)     First, we initially found it unclear what the exact scope of the Prosecution’s case against the Appellant at the trial was. At the first hearing of this appeal, we asked Deputy Public Prosecutor Mr Mark Tay (“Mr Tay”) whether he accepted that: (i) the Prosecution’s case stood or fell on whether, as Tan claimed, the Appellant had given Tan the Jorano bag of drugs; and (ii) the Appellant’s burden was only to raise a reasonable doubt on that issue. Mr Tay replied in the affirmative. On this basis, the proper order would have been to acquit the Appellant given our analysis below. However, Mr Tay’s answer was inconsistent with the materials before us. We thus decided to seek clarification from the Prosecution; we directed queries to the parties and invited them to make submissions in response to our queries. The Prosecution then clarified, in its first set of further submissions in response to our queries, that its reply at the first hearing of this appeal “was incorrect, and, to that extent, inappropriate”. Reference was made to the Opening Address, which laid out the two facets of the Prosecution’s case against the Appellant mentioned at [7] above, namely: (i) that he had given Tan the Jorano bag of drugs; and (ii) that he had sent Tan the Delivery Messages. The Defence did not deny in its submissions that the Prosecution’s case at the trial comprised these two facets. We were therefore satisfied that the Prosecution’s case did consist of these two elements.\n",
      "(b)     However, and critically, it was clear from the Opening Address and the record of proceedings that at the trial, the Prosecution never advanced the two individual facets of its case as independent bases for convicting the Appellant. More specifically, the Prosecution did not advance the Alternative Case as we have defined it (see [7] above). Rather, as the Prosecution put it in its second set of further submissions in response to our queries, its case against the Appellant “comprised of [sic] a singular narrative”. The two components of that narrative were never distinguished and put forward to be assessed standing on their own. This aspect of the Prosecution’s case flowed from its unyielding position at the trial that Tan was an entirely credible witness. Given that firm position, the Prosecution could not have advanced the Alternative Case, which proceeded on the premise that, contrary to Tan’s evidence, the Appellant had not given Tan the Jorano bag of drugs with the Ten Bundles already inside and pre-packed.We now turn to the Appellant’s case at the trial. In brief, the Appellant’s defence was that he had not entered into a plan with Tan for the latter to deliver the drugs in the Ten Bundles. It was Xiao Hu, to whom the Untraced Number belonged, who had made such a plan with Tan. The principal line of attack that the Appellant deployed against the Prosecution’s case was to challenge Tan’s evidence that the Appellant had handed him the Jorano bag of drugs on the morning of 21 February 2014. In this regard, the Appellant argued that Tan’s evidence was completely inconsistent with the DNA evidence and should therefore be rejected.As we have noted, the Appellant and Tan were tried together in a joint trial (see [2] above). The Judge first dealt with the charges against Tan. Tan’s defence was that he had not known the quantity of drugs he was carrying or the penalties for drug trafficking (see [9] of the Judgment). The Judge rejected this defence, relying on, among other things, Tan’s admissions in his statements to the CNB and the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA (see [10]–[11] of the Judgment).\n",

      "To illustrate the point, in Harven a/l Segar v PP [2017] 1 SLR 771 (“Harven”), the accused was carrying a backpack that contained bundles that were later found to be controlled drugs. The accused knew that there was a package in his backpack which had been handed to him by another person but he contended that he did not know the package contained drugs. He was acquitted. But this was not on the basis of him not being in possession of the drugs; rather, it was because the Court of Appeal, by a majority, accepted that he had proved that he did not know that the package contained drugs (at [71]). What this illustrates is that the question of whether the accused knows that the package or container contains drugs is an inquiry that arises when considering the question of knowledge rather than that of possession. Sequentially, one must first be shown to be in possession and then one must be shown to know the nature of that which one is in possession of. These are separate inquiries.In Criminal Appeals Nos 48 and 49 of 2017, Zainal and Rahmat appealed respectively against their convictions.

In addition, although Zainal did not appeal the Judge’s finding that he had the drugs for the purpose of trafficking and no part of Mr Fernando’s argument was directed to this, in our judgment, the evidence supported the Judge’s finding that Zainal possessed the drugs for the purpose of trafficking even without the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA.

      "The Judge rejected the Appellant’s argument that the Prosecution had failed to prove that all the loose portions of diamorphine found at the rubbish collection point originated from the Appellant. The Judge found that the possibility that some other person in the same block might have thrown some quantities of diamorphine down the rubbish chute at or around the same time as the Appellant’s arrest was a “highly implausible possibility” that was “simply insufficient to raise any reasonable doubt in the circumstances”: the GD at [58]. He made three points in this regard. First, there was only a very short lapse in time (about 20 minutes) from the point that the Appellant threw the two “batu” down the rubbish chute to the point when the diamorphine was retrieved by CNB officers. Second, given the street value of diamorphine, it was very unlikely that someone else would have thrown it down the same rubbish chute. Further, the total weight of the granular/powdery substance retrieved was 897.08g, which was close to the weight of two “batu” that the Appellant had described, ie, about 1 kg of drugs containing diamorphine.[note: 18] Third, the Appellant never disputed in any of his statements that the entirety of the diamorphine retrieved by CNB officers belonged to him and had been in his possession prior to his arrest. Indeed, he expressly and positively accepted in his statements that the drugs retrieved came from him: the GD at [58]–[63].The accused persons each appealed against their respective conviction and sentence. At the close of the hearing of the appeals, we dismissed Shanti’s appeal in its entirety. In brief, we held that it was incumbent on Shanti to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA and found that she had not come close to rebutting that presumption. In the circumstances, we dismissed her appeal against conviction and sentence. We reserved our judgment in relation to the Appellant and will now explain our decision for that appeal.In the interest of clarity, we draw out and dismiss two irrelevant distinctions to the court’s determination of whether the reason or purpose of an offender’s division and packing is that of distribution rather than transporting, sending or delivering the drugs. First, it is immaterial whether the direct recipients of the divided portions of the drugs from the offender are end-consumers or persons who are going to pass the drugs along to someone else. There is nothing in the idea of distribution that even vaguely connotes that the recipient should only be a consumer. Indeed, as we have explained, it is an empirical fact that drug distribution networks often work as “relay teams” (see also Christeen at [77]) in which the drugs only reach end-consumers after they have been passed along a chain of division and distribution. There is accordingly no reason to think that only those who directly hand the drugs over to individual consumers should be regarded as having performed an act of distribution. In addition, offenders who divide and pack drugs, intending to pass the divided amounts to recipients, may themselves be clueless as to whether those recipients are couriers, distributors, wholesalers, retailers, consumers or otherwise. As a practical matter, it may therefore be extremely difficult – if not altogether impossible – for the police or the court to ascertain the roles of the intended recipients.\n",

      "In PP v Goh Hock Huat [1994] 3 SLR(R) 375 (“Goh Hock Huat”), the accused (“Goh”) was found with 742.89g of diamorphine in his apartment and was charged under ss 5(a) and 17 of the version of the MDA then in force, the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 MDA”). The charge alleged that Goh was guilty of “traffic[king] ... by offering to sell, distribute or deliver” these drugs. The drugs recovered from his apartment were found alongside empty sachets, a digital weighing scale and various other apparatus and materials for dividing the drugs into smaller portions for distribution. Some of the drugs had been repacked from larger bundles into smaller sachets. Goh admitted that he knew the drugs were diamorphine and that he had repacked some of the drugs (at [6]). His defence was that the drugs were given to him by one Lu Lai Heng (“Lu”) and that he was merely a bailee or custodian of the drugs, holding them until Lu would come to collect them from his apartment. The trial judge accepted that Goh was merely keeping the drugs for Lu and had not offered to deliver the drugs to Lu. He also accepted Goh’s counsel’s submission that the return of drugs to an owner, instead of a third party, was not delivery. On this basis, he acquitted Goh of the trafficking charge. It should be noted that Goh’s case was prosecuted and decided before the 1993 amendments to the MDA introduced the provision in s 5(2) that “a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking”. Prior to the introduction of s 5(2), s 5 of the 1985 MDA only proscribed actually trafficking (s 5(a)) or offering to traffic in a controlled drug (s 5(b)), or doing any act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug (s 5(c)).The court then turned to address several authorities which counsel for Yakoob had referred to in support of the argument that the return of drugs to their owner would not amount to trafficking.\n",
      "(a)     First, counsel had submitted that the 1985 MDA only sought to punish traffickers who intended to purvey drugs to end-users, citing the observations of Lord Diplock in Ong Ah Chuan ([1] supra) at [10] that “supplying or distributing addictive drugs to others is the evil against which s 3 (of the 1973 version of the MDA) with its draconian penalties is directed”. Dismissing this argument, the court opined that the 1993 amendments to the MDA had “changed the complexion of [the presumption concerning trafficking in] s 17 and also introduced s 5(2)”. On this basis the court did not see how the Privy Council’s views in Ong Ah Chuan could have any relevance in the current statutory climate (Lee Yuan Kwang at [60]). The court also noted that the MDA made no reference to “end-users” or promotion or distribution of drugs, apart from the fact that “distribute” came within the definitions of “traffic” in s 2 of the MDA. There was no requirement that the person found in possession had to be a dealer or supplier in order for the presumption of trafficking in s 17 of the 1985 MDA to operate, nor was there any requirement for any proximate connection between the accused and any particular end-user.\n",
      "(b)     Counsel for Yakoob had also relied on the Australian decision of R v Carey (1990) 20 NSWLR 292 (“Carey”), where the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal acquitted the accused of a charge for supplying prohibited drugs under s 25 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (No 226 of 1985) (NSW) (“the New South Wales Act”), because the accused was only in possession of the drugs for temporary safekeeping and was intending to return them to her sister. Yong CJ held that this case could be “easily distinguished” because s 25(1) of the New South Wales Act proscribed the supply of prohibited drugs, which carried the connotation that there must be some element of provision, distribution or promotion of the drugs (Lee Yuan Kwang at [60]). The provisions of the 1985 MDA and the definition of “traffic” within the statute were worded in dissimilar terms.These principles are of especial importance in the context of charges for offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”). It is often the case that accused persons caught with drugs in their possession will seek to disassociate themselves entirely from the drugs by claiming that they had no knowledge of them at all, or that they believed they were items of a completely different, completely innocent nature. Having disavowed all knowledge of the drugs, the accused person often gets caught in a tangle of inconsistencies and adverse facts, which he cannot explain when the evidence is tested at trial. In such situations, the courts may rightly take into account the weaknesses and inconsistencies in the accused’s account and his general lack of credibility in determining his guilt; yet it is precisely in such situations that the courts must also guard against the mind-set that once an unbelievable defence is rejected, everything is to be taken against the accused. This might lead a court, inadvertently, to fill certain gaps in the evidence in order to support a finding against the accused, when it is rightly the Prosecution which bears the burden of filling such evidential gaps, failing which a conviction cannot be sustained.\n",

      "(a)     First, counsel had submitted that the 1985 MDA only sought to punish traffickers who intended to purvey drugs to end-users, citing the observations of Lord Diplock in Ong Ah Chuan ([1] supra) at [10] that “supplying or distributing addictive drugs to others is the evil against which s 3 (of the 1973 version of the MDA) with its draconian penalties is directed”. Dismissing this argument, the court opined that the 1993 amendments to the MDA had “changed the complexion of [the presumption concerning trafficking in] s 17 and also introduced s 5(2)”. On this basis the court did not see how the Privy Council’s views in Ong Ah Chuan could have any relevance in the current statutory climate (Lee Yuan Kwang at [60]). The court also noted that the MDA made no reference to “end-users” or promotion or distribution of drugs, apart from the fact that “distribute” came within the definitions of “traffic” in s 2 of the MDA. There was no requirement that the person found in possession had to be a dealer or supplier in order for the presumption of trafficking in s 17 of the 1985 MDA to operate, nor was there any requirement for any proximate connection between the accused and any particular end-user.\n",
      "(b)     Counsel for Yakoob had also relied on the Australian decision of R v Carey (1990) 20 NSWLR 292 (“Carey”), where the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal acquitted the accused of a charge for supplying prohibited drugs under s 25 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (No 226 of 1985) (NSW) (“the New South Wales Act”), because the accused was only in possession of the drugs for temporary safekeeping and was intending to return them to her sister. Yong CJ held that this case could be “easily distinguished” because s 25(1) of the New South Wales Act proscribed the supply of prohibited drugs, which carried the connotation that there must be some element of provision, distribution or promotion of the drugs (Lee Yuan Kwang at [60]). The provisions of the 1985 MDA and the definition of “traffic” within the statute were worded in dissimilar terms.These principles are of especial importance in the context of charges for offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”). It is often the case that accused persons caught with drugs in their possession will seek to disassociate themselves entirely from the drugs by claiming that they had no knowledge of them at all, or that they believed they were items of a completely different, completely innocent nature. Having disavowed all knowledge of the drugs, the accused person often gets caught in a tangle of inconsistencies and adverse facts, which he cannot explain when the evidence is tested at trial. In such situations, the courts may rightly take into account the weaknesses and inconsistencies in the accused’s account and his general lack of credibility in determining his guilt; yet it is precisely in such situations that the courts must also guard against the mind-set that once an unbelievable defence is rejected, everything is to be taken against the accused. This might lead a court, inadvertently, to fill certain gaps in the evidence in order to support a finding against the accused, when it is rightly the Prosecution which bears the burden of filling such evidential gaps, failing which a conviction cannot be sustained.\n",

      "In particular, the Judge rejected the Appellant’s evidence that he believed that the case contained only clothes and shoes. The Judge’s reasons may be summarised as follows (the GD at [11], [34] and [41]):\n",
      "(a)     It was “noteworthy” that the Appellant’s reaction, upon being told by the ICA officers of the drugs in the suitcase, was to cry, instead of immediately expressing that he was surprised, that he was unaware of the concealed packets or that he did not know that they were drugs.\n",
      "(b)     The Appellant’s reference to a “substance” in his cautioned statement indicated that he knew that the case contained more than just clothes and shoes. We digress to reiterate that having regard to the interpreter’s evidence, this conclusion seems to us to have been untenable.\n",
      "(c)     The Judge found that the Appellant did not in fact trust Izuchukwu and Chiedu. Indeed, he had reason not to, as he knew that they had supplied him with false calling cards and a false vaccination certificate (see [11] above) and this had been done to enable him to make the delivery.\n",
      "(d)     The Appellant had been promised a substantial reward for delivering the case to an unknown person in Singapore.Having rejected the Appellant’s defence, the Judge convicted the Appellant. As the Public Prosecutor did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance, the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B of the MDA was not an available option. The Judge therefore sentenced the Appellant to the mandatory death penalty.In Shan Kai Weng, the appellant had pleaded guilty to a charge of unlawful possession of one tablet of nimetazepam. The appellant then sought, by way of criminal revision, to retract his plea on the ground, among other things, that he did not understand the nature of his plea because he was unaware that knowledge that the tablet was a controlled drug was an ingredient of the offence. The court rejected this argument, and found that the appellant could not have been unaware that he was pleading guilty to a charge of possession of a controlled drug because this was set out very clearly in the charge and the statement of facts, which he had indicated he understood. It was clear, on this ground alone, that the appellant had no basis on which to retract his earlier plea of guilt, and the court’s decision not to allow the appellant to retract his plea was therefore defensible. However, the court went further, and suggested that yet another ground on which the appellant’s argument might be rejected was that his supposed lack of knowledge was in any case irrelevant because the mens rea of the offence required only that the accused person knew of the existence of the tablet (at [24]):\n",

      "(b)     in Criminal Appeal No 14 of 2019 (“CCA 14”), the Prosecution appealed against the acquittal of Zuraimy on the original trafficking charge; and\n",
      "(c)     in Criminal Appeal No 18 of 2019 (“CCA 18”), Zuraimy appealed against his sentence on the amended charge, on the ground that it is manifestly excessive.Moad Fadzir did not dispute that he had physical possession of the white plastic bag. His defence was that he had no knowledge of its contents. He thought that it contained illegal cigarettes. He also submitted that he did not have any common intention with Zuraimy to possess diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. He claimed that he allowed the white plastic bag to remain in his black bag because Zuraimy had said that he would collect the white plastic bag the next day.Following the ancillary hearing on admissibility of the contemporaneous statements, the Judge allowed P84 and P85 to be admitted into evidence and found that Moad Fadzir made those statements freely and without coercion for the following reasons.[note: 49] First, the injuries Moad Fadzir allegedly sustained in the course of his arrest all appeared to be minor.[note: 50] There was apparently a violent struggle during the arrest. Second, even if the Court accepted that Moad Fadzir was very much indisposed and too sleepy to answer questions properly, it was not and could not be sufficient in law to reject the statements just because he was under the influence of Ipam tablets and cough syrup, all of which he had consumed himself.[note: 51] Third, Moad Fadzir did not in fact testify at the ancillary hearing that the threat was to arrest his mother.[note: 52] If at all, SSI Tony Ng only said that because drugs were found in the Woodlands flat, the CNB may have to take Moad Fadzir’s mother in. Such a statement, the Judge said, was not quite the same as saying that they were going to arrest Moad Fadzir’s mother or that she would be charged. Further, the alleged threat that his mother might be taken to the police station did not seem to have been the strongest factor causing Moad Fadzir to make the contemporaneous statements. This was because the bulk of the ancillary hearing was focused on the question of Moad Fadzir’s inability to stay awake. The strongest part of the evidence of any threat concerning his mother came at the end of Moad Fadzir’s examination-in-chief and it took a leading question from his counsel to elicit from him that it was the alleged threat that led him to make the contemporaneous statements.\n",

      "(a)     On the facts of Anderton (which the House of Lords in Shivpuri described (at 21) as a situation “which most people, as a matter of common sense, would not regard as involving criminality”), the accused person would not have been found liable for attempting to dishonestly handle stolen goods because, in truth, pursuant to the first stage of the Framework, what she intended to do was to buy a cheap video recorder. She was indifferent to whether or not the video recorder was stolen, even if she believed or mistakenly thought it might be, and so did not possess the requisite intent to commit the specific criminal act of dishonestly handling stolen goods. This aligns with the outcome arrived at by the majority of the House of Lords in Anderton, but without recourse to the unworkable distinction between “objectively innocent” and “guilty” acts (see [84] above), which fails to have regard to the need to be mindful of the intent behind the putative act, regardless of the act which the accused person in fact carried out.\n",
      "(b)     The House of Lords acquitted the accused person in Haughton of attempting to handle stolen goods (see [76] above), but under the Framework, he would have been convicted because the act that he intended to do was a crime in every sense of the word, and in the circumstances, it was not a crime only because the police had already taken custody of the stolen corned beef without his knowledge. The result in Haughton is intuitively unsatisfactory, and indeed, as we mentioned earlier (at [69] and [77] above), the controversy attributed to the decision has been credited with spurring the enactment of the CAA (UK): see Anderton at 981. This dissatisfaction stems from the fact, as we have just observed, that the accused person in Haughton (unlike the accused person in Anderton) specifically intended to deal with stolen goods. Yet, he was acquitted on the basis that “[c]onduct which is not criminal is not converted into criminal conduct by the accused believing that a state of affairs exists which does not exist” (see the extract from Haughton reproduced at [76] above). As we have explained at [98(d)] and [107] above, the premise that the criminality of an attempt to commit an offence arises out of the patent criminality of the act performed is erroneous, and this underlies what we respectfully consider to have been the error in Haughton. The Framework would realign the result of the decision in Haughton with the rationale behind punishing an accused person for a criminal attempt: in specifically intending to deal with stolen goods and coupling that specific intent with sufficient acts, the accused person in Haughton would be found, under the Framework, to be both morally and legally culpable, and therefore would be punished so as to deter him from further crime.\n",
      "(c)     In a situation where an accused person has sex with a girl over the age of 16 in the mistaken belief that she is under that age (see [79] above), whether he would be liable would turn on the question of his specific intent. If, by way of analogy with the facts in Anderton, he was indifferent to the actual age of the girl even if he mistakenly believed she might be underage, he would not be liable for attempting to commit statutory rape. Conversely, if the evidence demonstrates that he specifically targeted the girl because he thought she was under the age of 16 and would not have had sex with her otherwise, then he would be liable. This distinction would be justified on the basis of deterrence because the accused person in the latter situation would demonstrably be a danger to underage girls, which is precisely the danger that the applicable provisions are meant to protect against. He would also be more morally culpable and deserving of punishment in specifically intending to target a protected group of individuals.\n",
      "(d)     In the umbrella “theft” scenario (see [79] above), whether or not liability would attach would depend on the accused person’s specific intention. Did he intend to take an umbrella that was not his own? If so, he would be liable for a criminal attempt, even if, by mistake, he ended up taking his own umbrella.This is Han’s appeal against his conviction and sentence. For reasons which we will explain in this judgment, we are satisfied that Han’s appeal should be allowed. In essence, we think that a reasonable doubt has arisen in relation to the charge that was brought against Han. However, we also think that based on Han’s own evidence, consideration should be given to an alternative charge being pressed against him for attempting to commit a different offence. As it turned out, it was not possible for the primary offence, which Han says he did intend to commit, to have been committed. This judgment presents us with the opportunity to reconsider the law on what we will term “impossible attempts”, that is to say, attempts to commit offences that could not possibly have been consummated in the circumstances. Before we do so, we recount the key facts.On the intention to possess the diamorphine contained in D1B, the Judge found that the weight of the evidence cohered with the Prosecution’s case that Han had ordered diamorphine from Lao Ban for the price of $3,600, and had specifically arranged to meet Khor on the morning of 2 March 2016 to collect the drugs ordered:\n",
      "(a)     It was not disputed that in the phone conversations between Khor and Lao Ban, T was a reference to Han. Although Lao Ban had instructed Khor to deliver one yellow bundle to T, the Judge found that given the context of the recorded phone conversations between Khor and Lao Ban, it was clear that Lao Ban had in fact been referring to one of the three black bundles of similar shape and size (namely, C1B, C1C and D1B). This was because Lao Ban had referred to the three yellow bundles interchangeably. Lao Ban had also referred to the yellow bundles as “big” bundles. The only three bundles that: (i) were of similar shape and size; (ii) contained the same controlled drug; and (iii) were bigger than the other four bundles were C1B, C1C and D1B. The Judge also noted that Khor had subjectively understood Lao Ban’s instructions to mean that he was supposed to deliver one of these three bundles to T (see the GD at [74]–[77]). The fact that all seven of the bundles were labelled “Ken” was immaterial as there was evidence from Khor that in previous deliveries, the labels on the bundles had not been determinative as to who the intended recipients would be (see the GD at [78]). The Judge rejected Han’s defence that there had been a mix-up in his drug order. This was thought to be extremely unlikely given the high stakes involved in transporting such large quantities of drugs (see the GD at [79]). Further, after Khor arrived in Singapore, Lao Ban had contacted Han several times to confirm that the delivery of the drugs which Han had ordered would take place. None of the seven bundles of drugs found in Khor’s possession contained ketamine, which Han claimed he had ordered, and the only bundle containing Ice contained 34.04g of the drug, and not 25g as purportedly ordered by Han. In short, none of the drugs in the seven bundles matched Han’s purported order of 100g of ketamine and 25g of Ice (see the GD at [80]).\n",
      "(b)     The Judge found that the sum of $3,600 found on Han when he was arrested was meant to be the exact payment for the diamorphine contained in D1B. One of the CNB officers had testified that the market price of one pound of heroin was approximately $3,600. Han’s explanations of the purpose of the $3,600 were inconsistent, in that the explanations that he gave: (i) in his contemporaneous statement recorded shortly after his arrest on 2 March 2016; (ii) in his long statement recorded on 8 March 2016; (iii) in his long statement recorded on 9 March 2016; and (iv) at the trial all differed from each other (see the GD at [82]–[84]).\n",
      "(c)     The Judge noted that Han had failed to mention his order of ketamine and Ice in his cautioned statement recorded on 2 March 2016, when he was invited to state his defence in respect of a charge that he had engaged in a conspiracy with Khor and other unknown persons to import diamorphine into Singapore. This undermined Han’s defence that he had ordered only ketamine and Ice, and not diamorphine, from Lao Ban (see the GD at [85]–[86]).\n",
      "(d)     The Judge highlighted that contrary to the impression that Han sought to give in his statements and at the trial (namely, that he had not made any prior arrangements with Khor to meet him, and that Khor had in fact interrupted his plan, which had been to meet some others to gamble), the objective call records and transcripts made clear that Han had not only been expecting a courier to deliver his order of drugs on 2 March 2016, but had also taken active steps to arrange to meet the courier (see the GD at [87]–[91]).\n",

      "On 17 October 2019, we reserved judgment in Farid’s appeal and dismissed Ranjit’s appeal. In this judgment, we uphold Farid’s conviction but find that Farid was a courier for the drug transaction in question. However, since the Public Prosecutor did not issue Farid a certificate of substantive assistance, this finding has no effect on the sentence imposed. In Ranjit’s appeal, apart from giving our reasons for dismissing his appeal, we also discuss the principles involved in determining allegations made by accused persons against their counsel pertaining to non-compliance with instructions and inadequate legal assistance.CM 5/2017 was first heard before us on 18 August 2017. At that hearing, we rejected Ranjit’s application to withdraw his consent to the Statement of Agreed Facts. We will explain our reasons later in this judgment. As for Ranjit’s application to adduce further evidence, we ruled that the application should be heard together with Ranjit’s main appeal. We stated the following:[note: 53]On the alleged failure to present evidence that Ranjit was not in financial difficulties and to dispute portions of his long statement dated 11 February 2014 which stated that he was in financial difficulties, the Judge rejected Ranjit’s contention. The Judge held that while Ranjit had made such assertions, it remained for the previous lawyers to assess their merits and for parties to agree on the stance to be adopted at the trial. On this, the Judge accepted Mr Retnam’s and Mr Selvaraj’s explanation that raising Ranjit’s assertion regarding his financial position would affect his credibility as a witness given that it was inconsistent with his previous statement and his interview with Dr Kenneth Koh (“Dr Koh”), a psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health. As such, disputing the portions of the long statement dated 11 February 2014 on this point carried some risk. The Judge found that in not dealing with this area, the trial counsel acted in accordance with the agreed approach to focus on the material aspects of the defence. Finally, the Judge also took note of the fact that in cross-examination, Ranjit admitted that he did not tell Mr Retnam or Mr Selvaraj that he wanted his financial status to be an important part of his defence (see Findings on Remittal ([64] supra) at [60] to [65]).\n",

      "On 17 October 2019, we reserved judgment in Farid’s appeal and dismissed Ranjit’s appeal. In this judgment, we uphold Farid’s conviction but find that Farid was a courier for the drug transaction in question. However, since the Public Prosecutor did not issue Farid a certificate of substantive assistance, this finding has no effect on the sentence imposed. In Ranjit’s appeal, apart from giving our reasons for dismissing his appeal, we also discuss the principles involved in determining allegations made by accused persons against their counsel pertaining to non-compliance with instructions and inadequate legal assistance.CM 5/2017 was first heard before us on 18 August 2017. At that hearing, we rejected Ranjit’s application to withdraw his consent to the Statement of Agreed Facts. We will explain our reasons later in this judgment. As for Ranjit’s application to adduce further evidence, we ruled that the application should be heard together with Ranjit’s main appeal. We stated the following:[note: 53]On the alleged failure to present evidence that Ranjit was not in financial difficulties and to dispute portions of his long statement dated 11 February 2014 which stated that he was in financial difficulties, the Judge rejected Ranjit’s contention. The Judge held that while Ranjit had made such assertions, it remained for the previous lawyers to assess their merits and for parties to agree on the stance to be adopted at the trial. On this, the Judge accepted Mr Retnam’s and Mr Selvaraj’s explanation that raising Ranjit’s assertion regarding his financial position would affect his credibility as a witness given that it was inconsistent with his previous statement and his interview with Dr Kenneth Koh (“Dr Koh”), a psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health. As such, disputing the portions of the long statement dated 11 February 2014 on this point carried some risk. The Judge found that in not dealing with this area, the trial counsel acted in accordance with the agreed approach to focus on the material aspects of the defence. Finally, the Judge also took note of the fact that in cross-examination, Ranjit admitted that he did not tell Mr Retnam or Mr Selvaraj that he wanted his financial status to be an important part of his defence (see Findings on Remittal ([64] supra) at [60] to [65]).\n",

      "We turn finally to the last issue, which is whether there was excessive judicial interference at the trial. The Appellant submitted that there were numerous examples of the Judge “descending into the arena” and “taking over the conduct of the questioning of witnesses”, and the impression thus given was that her vision had been “clouded by the dust of the conflict” (an expression taken from the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Yuill v Yuill [1945] P 15 (“Yuill”) at 20). The Appellant submitted that the Judge did not merely ask clarificatory questions, but instead engaged in long and sustained bouts of questioning, and her interventions were at times at crucial points which interrupted counsel’s line of questioning. Nevertheless, the Appellant did not suggest that the Judge was biased. Mr Jumabhoy also clarified that he was not seeking for the matter to be reheard before another judge. Rather, Mr Jumabhoy submitted that, in fairness to the Appellant, we should convict him only of what we were satisfied was safe to convict him of in all the circumstances, and that would be an amended charge of possession of the diamorphine under s 8(a) of the MDA. Mr Jumabhoy submitted that the Appellant should accordingly be acquitted of the two capital trafficking charges to which he had claimed trial.The Appellant, however, testified that he did not know that Faizal would be bringing the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016. He claimed that he had been asleep from about 7.00pm until about 10.00pm on the night of 26 January 2016, and after he woke up, he left the Flat with Faizal at about 10.20pm. It was only on the next day, 27 January 2016, that he discovered the diamorphine and the trolley bag in the Flat. According to the Appellant, on 27 January 2016, at about 2.00pm, he noticed several packets of diamorphine laid out on the bed in Bedroom 1. He got into a quarrel with his wife, Mashitta, who was angry that the Appellant allowed people to come to the Flat to “do ‘drugs’” and “make use of [him]”. The Appellant then placed the packets of diamorphine into an “Akira” fan box (“the Akira box”) which was in Bedroom 1. He suspected that it was Sufian, the occupier of Bedroom 1, who had laid out the diamorphine on the bed.The Judge found the Appellant guilty of both charges. In relation to the first charge, the Judge made the following findings. First, the Appellant had possession of the diamorphine since he had physical control of the Akira box and the Mintek bag, which together contained the 64 packets of diamorphine. Second, the Appellant, by his own evidence, knew at the material time that those 64 packets contained diamorphine. Third, the Appellant had not rebutted the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA. The Judge rejected the Appellant’s evidence that he had merely been holding the diamorphine pending its retrieval by Sufian and/or Faizal. The Judge reasoned that the Appellant’s evidence as to the intended purpose of the diamorphine was “inextricably linked to his wider story” about how the drugs came to be present in the Flat without his knowledge. Rejecting his assertions, the Judge found that the Appellant knew that Faizal would be delivering the drugs to the Flat on 26 January 2016. The Judge also noted the large quantity of diamorphine in the Appellant’s possession, more than four times the amount which mandated the imposition of capital punishment (see GD at [89]–[91]). Having rejected the Appellant’s primary case as to how he came to be in possession of the diamorphine, the Judge had no difficulty finding that the Appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking.\n",

In CA/CCA 4/2019, the Prosecution appeals against the Judge’s amendment and reduction of the charge against Aishamudin. We heard these appeals and applications together. At the end of the hearing, we indicated to Roszaidi that we would dismiss his appeal against conviction, and remit the issue of whether he qualified for the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B(3) of the MDA to the Judge for additional psychiatric evidence to be taken under s 392(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”).

There, a couple, Mas Swan bin Adnan (“Mas Swan”) and Roshamima binti Roslan (“Roshamima”) were tried on a joint charge of importing 123 packets containing 21.48g of diamorphine into Singapore by car. These packets were packed in three bundles, which were hidden in the car. At trial, Mas Swan contended that he knew that the three bundles were in the car because Roshamima had told him so; but Mas Swan also claimed that Roshamima had told him the bundles contained only ecstasy pills. Roshamima on the other hand denied any such conversation having taken place between her and Mas Swan, and maintained that she was wholly unaware of the existence of the three bundles in the car. The High Court Judge accepted Mas Swan’s evidence and acquitted him of the charge of importing diamorphine, and consequently convicted Roshamima because she had run a defence that admitted of only two possibilities: either she was ignorant of the existence of the bundles and should be acquitted, or she was lying and should be convicted. This was so on the facts because Roshamima had never advanced any other possible case (see Mas Swan at [63]).The other persons involved in these events were dealt with separately:\n",

      "The Prosecution also pointed out that the Appellant had admitted to knowing that he was transporting drugs in his contemporaneous and his cautioned statements. In his contemporaneous statement, which was recorded in Malay, the Appellant said that “[d]rugs were found” in the Car; and in his cautioned statement, which was recorded in English, the Appellant stated that he “admit[ted] to bringing drugs into Singapore”. The Prosecution submitted that this belied the Appellant’s claim that he in fact believed the ten bundles only contained contraband tobacco. In response to the Appellant’s claim that he had been suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms at the time the statements were recorded and that he was not conversant in the languages used to record the statements, the Prosecution contended that these claims were baseless and should be rejected. The Appellant also claimed that he had identified the contents of the ten bundles as drugs in his statements only because the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers had torn open two of the bundles and informed him that drugs were found. The Prosecution pointed out that contrary to this assertion, there were no signs of tampering of the bundles and none of the bundles had been torn open. Further, the Appellant could not identify the CNB officers who had allegedly said or done any of this.The Judge found on the basis of the following facts and evidence that the Appellant actually knew that he was carrying cannabis and cannabis mixture:\n",
      "(a)     There was insufficient basis to believe that the Appellant truly trusted Aya. The Appellant’s relationship with Aya was short, and given that the Appellant knew about Aya’s involvement in smuggling drugs, he must have been wary of any assurances given by Aya to the effect that the delivery he was being asked to make did not involve drugs. Moreover, the Appellant testified that Aya had initially asked him to transport drugs to Singapore but he had declined to do so. He had then allegedly been asked to deliver contraband tobacco instead. In these circumstances, the Appellant’s contention that he genuinely believed he was transporting something other than drugs was not believable (at [31] and [48]).\n",
      "(b)     There were many opportunities for the Appellant to check and verify the contents of the ten bundles with Aya, but he evidently did not do so despite the circumstances pointing against his belief that the bundles contained contraband tobacco rather than drugs (at [33] and [49]).\n",
      "(c)     The other surrounding circumstances, including the Appellant’s lack of control over the Car and its contents on the night prior to his departure for Singapore, the measures taken in respect of the Car such as the fact that it was rented and its windows then had to be tinted, and the concealment of the ten bundles in the Car’s armrests, should all have raised further concerns. The reward of S$5,000 for delivering the ten bundles, which was “significantly higher” than the sale value of the quantity of tobacco that could be contained in the bundles, was seriously problematic because it wholly undermined the Appellant’s claim that he believed the ten bundles contained nothing other than contraband tobacco. Even if the reward were RM2,000 instead, it was still a significant amount for delivering tobacco that, on the Appellant’s own evidence, was supposedly worth RM7,000 (at [32], [51] and [58]). The amount of effort undertaken in preparation for the delivery was implausible and disproportionate if it had truly been for the smuggling of contraband tobacco only (at [58]).\n",
      "(d)     The Appellant failed to mention in any of his statements the version of the events that he advanced at the trial. This gave rise to the inference that that version of the events was not the truth but merely an afterthought (at [52] and [53]).\n",
      "(e)     Having rejected the case for the Defence, the Judge found that what was left was only the version of the events put forward by the Prosecution, namely, that the Appellant knew he was carrying Class A controlled drugs into Singapore (at [61]).We heard the parties on 22 March 2018, and dismissed the Appellant’s appeal against his conviction on the Importation of Cannabis Charge at the end of that hearing because we did not find his claims plausible for the following reasons.\n",

      "In the period leading up to the present appeals, Rizwan and Saminathan filed two separate criminal motions, viz, Criminal Motion No 11 of 2019 (“CM 11/2019”) and Criminal Motion No 4 of 2019 (“CM 4/2019”). CM 11/2019 was an application by Rizwan for leave to adduce alibi evidence in the form of testimony from Mohammed Farhan bin Baharudin (“Farhan”). CM 4/2019 was an application by Saminathan for leave to adduce three categories of evidence. These were (a) alibi evidence in the form of testimony from his mother, Mdm Mahalatchmay a/l N Chella Permal (“Mdm Mahalatchmay”) and sister, Selvakumari a/l Selvaraju (“Ms Selvakumari”); (b) statements made by him to the police during investigations and other documents which were not tendered as evidence at the trial; and (c) communications between his counsel at the appeal and an expert witness engaged for Saminathan’s defence during the trial. We heard both applications on 22 November 2019 and dismissed them. We indicated then we would give our reasons after we had heard the substantive appeals. We do so towards the end of this judgment.The Judge rejected Rizwan’s defence as being unbelievable. It made no sense that Rizwan would follow “Uncle’s” instructions so faithfully when he had met “Uncle” only in September 2013, merely two months before the transaction. Moreover, Rizwan knew hardly anything about “Uncle”. When Rizwan found out that his car was involved in a CNB operation, the logical thing for him to have done was to inform the authorities about this, not go into hiding and then leave Singapore by illegal means (GD at [72]). Rizwan’s account that he was told to leave his house at 9.20pm on 20 November 2013 because something had happened to his car also did not make sense because the drug transaction and the subsequent impoundment of his Black Mitsubishi only occurred after 10pm that night (GD at [73]). The Judge also found that Rizwan had been inconsistent in accounting for his movements on 20 November 2013 and the days after that. The account he gave in his statement recorded on 30 November 2013 was that he could not remember what had happened on those days. In particular, he stated that he could not recall what he did on 20 November 2013 because he had taken some medication (cough syrup and Panadol for his cough and flu) obtained from a clinic earlier that day. However, at the trial, he was able to give detailed evidence about the events that night leading to him fleeing Singapore (GD at [74]). The Judge did not accept Rizwan’s explanation that he was still in shock after his arrest when he gave his statements. Further, Rizwan’s conduct in fleeing Singapore surreptitiously also pointed towards his guilt (GD at [75]).The Judge also examined the possibility that Zulkarnain framed Rizwan for the purposes of obtaining a certificate of substantive assistance from the Public Prosecutor. She noted that this was a belated allegation which arose only in the course of Rizwan’s testimony in court and which was then pursued in the closing submissions. The Judge dismissed this allegation because there was no reason why Zulkarnain would frame Rizwan instead of naming the real “Boss”. She also noted that Zulkarnain had identified Rizwan from the very day after the drug transaction when he was shown a number of photographs (GD at [77]).\n",
