pytorch-allennlp setup
======================
Activate the desired virtual environment or create a new virtual environment and activate that.

Go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
select the system and computer settings that best match your system and computer, then copy the installation command generated and run it in the prompt/terminal/shell:

e.g. `pip install torch==1.5.0+cpu torchvision==0.6.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html`

Then, install AllenNLP:
`pip install allennlp`
This will install a ton of libraries that AllenNLP uses. This will take a while...

We could have pip installed using the complete 'requirements.txt' file but sometimes the libraries have to be installed in a particular order, so it might be better to install the dependencies step-by-step this way. In any case, the steps are already hugely condensed with `pip install allennlp`.

when loading the allennlp model you may run into a spacy linking issue. follow these steps to solve it.
