    "    \"passage\": \"The trial judges accepted that both the appellants had come into Singapore only with a view to boarding a flight to Amsterdam the next day. They, however, rejected the submission made on behalf of the appellants that bringing drugs into Singapore with a view solely of exporting them would not be an offence under s 7 of the Act. They also rejected Ko’s defence that he did not know that what he was carrying was diamorphine. Accordingly, they convicted the appellants. Against the convictions, this appeal was brought. At the conclusion we dismissed it, and we now give our reasons.Ground (a) can be disposed of very briefly. By s 18(2) of the Act a rebuttable presumption arose that Ko knew the nature of the drug that he was carrying. Once the presumption arose, the onus of discharging it was on Ko. Having heard Ko’s defence, the trial judges were satisfied that he had not discharged the presumption. We have reviewed the record and it is clear that the trial judges were entitled on the evidence before them to arrive at this finding. We saw no reason to interfere.and submitted that s 7 was applicable only when it was sought to punish a master or captain who had contravened s 20. We could not accept that submission. In common with a number of other similar provisions in the Act, what s 20 does is to raise a presumption as to knowledge. By s 20, if it is proved that a drug was found in a ship or aircraft, then the presumption would arise that the drug was imported in the ship or aircraft with the knowledge of the master or captain. No doubt, in such a case, a master or captain may be charged for violating s 7 of the Act but that does not mean to say that s 7 is confined in its operations only to the master of a ship or captain of an aircraft used for the import of drugs. We see no reason why s 7 should not operate against (say) a passenger in a ship or aircraft who was importing drugs. Against such a passenger the presumption under s 20 as to knowledge would obviously not be applicable but (as in this case) the presumption under s 18(2) would apply.\",\n",
