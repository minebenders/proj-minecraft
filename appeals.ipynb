    "    \"passage\": \"The trial judges accepted that both the appellants had come into Singapore only with a view to boarding a flight to Amsterdam the next day. They, however, rejected the submission made on behalf of the appellants that bringing drugs into Singapore with a view solely of exporting them would not be an offence under s 7 of the Act. They also rejected Ko’s defence that he did not know that what he was carrying was diamorphine. Accordingly, they convicted the appellants. Against the convictions, this appeal was brought. At the conclusion we dismissed it, and we now give our reasons.Ground (a) can be disposed of very briefly. By s 18(2) of the Act a rebuttable presumption arose that Ko knew the nature of the drug that he was carrying. Once the presumption arose, the onus of discharging it was on Ko. Having heard Ko’s defence, the trial judges were satisfied that he had not discharged the presumption. We have reviewed the record and it is clear that the trial judges were entitled on the evidence before them to arrive at this finding. We saw no reason to interfere.and submitted that s 7 was applicable only when it was sought to punish a master or captain who had contravened s 20. We could not accept that submission. In common with a number of other similar provisions in the Act, what s 20 does is to raise a presumption as to knowledge. By s 20, if it is proved that a drug was found in a ship or aircraft, then the presumption would arise that the drug was imported in the ship or aircraft with the knowledge of the master or captain. No doubt, in such a case, a master or captain may be charged for violating s 7 of the Act but that does not mean to say that s 7 is confined in its operations only to the master of a ship or captain of an aircraft used for the import of drugs. We see no reason why s 7 should not operate against (say) a passenger in a ship or aircraft who was importing drugs. Against such a passenger the presumption under s 20 as to knowledge would obviously not be applicable but (as in this case) the presumption under s 18(2) would apply.\",\n",

      " We would record our grave doubts over the correctness of the appellant’s actions in the days after the respondent’s acquittal below. However, in view of our decision to dismiss the appeal, and in the absence of full argument on the nature and extent of the court’s inherent jurisdiction over its criminal procedure, we would decline to express any definitive view on Mr Sant Singh’s contentions although we are of the preliminary view that such a power to stay criminal proceedings in circumstances where it can be shown that the accused could not have a fair trial exists. The learned DPP conceded in his reply that the appeal would fail if we found against him on the issue of joint custody or joint possession of the Gucci bag. However, in view of counsel’s arguments on the question of common intention, we will deal briefly with the views we formed on this element of the charge against the respondent. In R v Strong The Times (26 January 1989), the English Court of Appeal had to consider the question of what the Prosecution has to prove in order to make out the charge of joint possession of cannabis where the cannabis was found concealed in the car in which the accused were travelling. Lord Lane LCJ is reported as having said: The distinction is thus between inculpatory and exculpatory parts of a statement. We did not see how the statements as regards the plan to smuggle contraband could be taken as inculpatory with reference to a charge of attempting to export controlled drugs. If the truth of her statement that the contraband was Du Pont pens and lighters could not be accepted at this stage, then equally we could not accept that there was a plan to smuggle. On that basis, by the DPP’s own concession that the events in Singapore alone did not prove joint possession of the diamorphine, the Prosecution had not made out its case.\n",

      " Having perused the record of appeal, however, we feel it necessary at the same time to add our observations as regards the decision in the court below to disallow the admission of the appellant’s s 122(6) statement recorded by Senior Narcotics Officer Chew. Two reasons were given for this decision. Firstly, the fact that the appellant had not been given any food or drink after his arrest and up to the time the s 122(6) statement was being recorded (a period of about seven hours) was held to have “sapped” his free will. Secondly, there was apparently some confusion as to whether the appellant had been taken to hospital for his post-statement medical examination immediately after his statement was recorded (as the appellant claimed) or whether there had been a delay of about half an hour (as Chew claimed); and this confusion was held to have thrown the integrity of the recording process into question. Having regard to the reasons given above we dismissed the appeal. We were also of the view that in any case the learned judicial commissioner did not actually rely on the evidence of Koh’s pocket book entries in coming to his decision. Although he set out the contents of the pocket book entries in his judgment, this was done as part of the process of setting out the relevant background to the case. He referred to Koh’s evidence again when rejecting the appellant’s defence of duress but this reference was made after he had examined the evidence given by the appellant in court and found that on the basis of the appellant’s own evidence, the defence of duress was not made out. Indeed, the reference to Koh’s pocket book entries was somewhat perfunctory since by that stage it was eminently clear that, in dismissing the defence of duress, it would be unnecessary to rely on the evidence of the pocket book entries. We were of the view therefore that the admission of Koh’s pocket book entries as evidence did not occasion the appellant such prejudice as to deprive him of a fair trial. Since neither defence raised by the appellant was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case, the appellant was convicted of the charge against him.\n",
