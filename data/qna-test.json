   "passage": "The only point I would add is this: since not all the opium was tested for morphine content, it follows that the 1,200g the trafficking charge dealt with must come from the portion that was tested. In other words, the 1,200g could only be carved out of the 3,062g that was tested. This fact was not material in the present case. Since each case must depend on its own facts, I do not wish to say whether it may make any difference in other cases on different facts. For these reasons, I was of the view that there was no merit in the appeal. I accordingly dismissed it.",

	"passage": "Having considered the totality of the evidence and especially the submissions made in Tan’s defence, I have come to the unwavering conclusion that the presumption that Tan either knew that he was importing drugs (or at the very least was wilfully blind to that fact) has not been rebutted on a balance of probabilities. Indeed, based on the evidence adduced, Tan’s guilt is axiomatic even without the application of the statutory presumptions. He knew he was importing heroin. In the circumstances, I have convicted and sentenced Tan accordingly.",

{
	"passage": "The MDA establishes three core evidential presumptions in connection with drug trafficking. First, a person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control a controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession: s 18(1) of the MDA. Second, if a person is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession he shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug: s 18(2) of the MDA. Third, upon proof of possession of an amount of the controlled drug in excess of a certain stipulated quantity it shall be presumed, unless it is proved to the contrary, that the possession was for the purposes of trafficking: s 17 of the MDA. These presumptions operate quite independently of one another and the unrebutted application of one presumption does not necessarily or inevitably preclude a rebuttal of the others.",
