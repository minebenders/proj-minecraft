32,[1995] SGCA 68 GOH JOON TONG,"We dismissed their appeals and now give our reasons.Ko also appealed on the basis that the statements made by him had not been voluntarily made and his defence should not have been rejected. He maintained that he was threatened and assaulted during the interrogations by a team of officers. These allegations of threats and assaults made by Ko were examined and were rejected by the learned trial judge. The learned trial judge did not believe his evidence of threat and assault and on the evidence he was justified in holding that the statements had been made voluntarily by Ko.There was, therefore, ample evidence against both the appellants. They had abetted Tan by conspiracy to export a large quantity of heroin to Spain, in consequence of which Tan attempted to do so but was arrested at the airport. Both the appeals were without merit and were dismissed",1
