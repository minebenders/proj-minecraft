It has also not disputed Ng and Cheng’s pattern of ordering one or half a pound of heroin at any given point in time, save for pointing out one text message (on 8 May 2014) recording their order for one and a half pounds. This is in contrast to the other nine instances of orders of heroin between 7 March and 14 May 2014 where they had not deviated from their purported pattern. I thus find that Ng and Cheng expected to collect one pound of heroin on 16 May 2014. Even after collecting the bundle, Ng and Cheng may have truly and reasonably believed that the bundle contained only one pound of heroin and no more, and had no knowledge of the existence of the additional pound. Thus, I find that the Prosecution has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Ng and Cheng had knowledge of the existence of the additional pound of heroin. The original charge faced by Ng and Cheng was that they were in joint possession of 21.58g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, in furtherance of their common intention to traffic in drugs.
