102,[2017] SGCA 16 HARVEN A/L SEGAR,"enabling the Prosecution to invoke the presumptions of possession and knowledge in ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA respectively. In relation to the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2), it was the Appellant who bore the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that he had no knowledge of the nature of the controlled drugs in his possession. It was not the duty of the Prosecution to call evidence to prove that the Appellant did not lack knowledge of the drugs in his possession because the s 18(2) presumption, once invoked, meant that the Appellant had knowledge of the nature of the drugs and the Prosecution was entitled to rest its case on that fact, leaving the Appellant to provide evidence to rebut the presumption (see the recent decision of this court in Obeng Comfort v PP [2017] 1 SLR 633 at [33]–[40] of that judgment). If the Appellant did so, the Prosecution would then have to decide whether or not it was necessary to call evidence to rebut the Appellant’s evidence. Since the Appellant’s defence turned on his claim that he was simply doing Mogan a favour by delivering some “presents” to Mogan’s friend, it was open to, and indeed incumbent upon, the Appellant to call Mogan as his witness and to apply to cross-examine him if necessary. However, according to the Appellant’s counsel, the Appellant made a considered decision not to call Mogan as his witness at the trial. It should be noted too that the same counsel had also acted for Mogan when Mogan was brought to court to answer his case. In my opinion, the evidence showed that the Appellant was conscious of the need to keep the Bundles away from sight. It will be recalled that the black plastic bag which contained the Bundles was initially placed by the Appellant in the basket at the front of his motorcycle. Shortly afterwards, the Bundles were poured into the centre compartment of the Haversack and pushed into a corner. The Appellant also placed the five packets of bread that he had bought at the petrol kiosk (see [90] above) into the same compartment. After that, came the packet of Indian cooked food with curry. Other than the packets of bread and the packet of cooked food, the compartment containing the Bundles also held the Appellant’s miscellaneous personal belongings such as a red Singtel pouch, a handkerchief, a mobile phone charger, a car charger, many sockets, an LCD screen cleaning kit, a plastic container with one earpiece, a piece of blue cloth and an Allen key. The circumstances therefore showed that the Appellant was trying to keep the Bundles away from sight by placing them in one corner at the bottom of the centre compartment of the Haversack. As I have indicated earlier, this also showed that he had no concern that the alleged presents in the Bundles could be damaged by all his other belongings in the same compartment. This was clearly one of the factors that pointed to his knowledge of the contents of the Bundles. I mention here in passing that by the time the Appellant arrived at Jalan Besar to meet the intended recipient of the Bundles","The Bundles containing the controlled drugs were found in the Appellant ’s possession, thereby enabling the Prosecution to invoke the presumptions of possession and knowledge in ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA respectively .
