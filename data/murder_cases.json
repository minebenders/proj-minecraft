      "2": "Before we give our decisions on the amended charges on which the three accused stand trial, we want to express our deep appreciation to all who have assisted us in this long trial which has taken 41 hearing days. First, we thank you Mr Glenn Knight, and Mr Roy Neighbour who has assisted you for the very careful presentation of the prosecution case. Next, there is Mr Cashin (whom we released last Friday) assisted by Mr Choo Han Teck who represents the first accused, Mr J B Jeyaretnam the second accused, and Mr Nathan Isaac the third accused. We are grateful to them for having accepted the assignments to defend the three accused. They can take satisfaction that they have discharged their public duty courageously and, in the highest traditions of the Bar, they have given their best for their respective clients. Next, we are indebted to the expert witnesses, the scientific officers, the pathologist and the doctors in psychiatric medicine, the last of whom have played a significant role in this trial. Finally, we pay tribute to the team of police officers who had the conduct of the investigations in the Special Investigation Section of the Criminal Investigation Department, in particular we commend Inspector Pereira for the early detection of the offenders in respect of the murder of Ghazali bin Marzuki and Inspector Suppiah who led the team for the diligence and thoroughness shown in the investigations of the crimes committed by the three accused.",
      "3": "Now, on the two amended charges, the three accused have from the very outset admitted the facts relating to the killings of the two children, Agnes Ng and Ghazali bin Marzuki. Throughout the trial, the participation of each of them in furtherance of the common intention to kill the two children has never been in doubt. All these are found in the lengthy statements voluntarily given by the three of them to the police soon after their arrest. These statements were put in evidence by their respective counsel in the course of the case for the prosecution. So it was that at the close of the prosecution case we held that a prima facie case had been made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant the conviction of the three accused on the two amended charges.",
      "4": "The only defence of the three accused is that at the time of the commission of the offence each of them was suffering from diminished responsibility as defined in Exception 7 to section 300 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, it is submitted that the three of them are guilty not of murder but of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. There is, however, one exception. On behalf of the third accused, it is also submitted that we should consider the defence of insanity under section 84 of the Penal Code. We have done so and we reject this latter submission as without foundation.",
      "5": "Exception 7 to section 300 reads as follows:",
      "6": "The burden of proof that an accused charged with murder comes within this Exception is on the defence. It is settled law that this burden is on the balance of probabilities.",
      "7": "The law of diminished responsibility is clearly explained in Rex v Byrne (1960) 3 All ER 1 and this has been accepted in Singapore in Cheng Swee Hin v Public Prosecutor (1981) 1 MLJ 1, a decision of our Court of Criminal Appeal. In the context of the evidence given in this trial, to come within the Exception each of the three accused must show that (a) he or she was suffering from an abnormality of mind induced by disease and, (b) that the abnormality of mind was such as substantially impaired his or her mental responsibility for the killing of the two children.",
      "8": "We have carefully considered, not just the medical evidence of each of the three accused and the evidence in rebuttal of them for the prosecution, but, as we must as Judges of facts, all the evidence before us. Now we have reviewed the whole of the evidence in the light of the submissions made to us by counsel for the Defence and Prosecution. The decisions we have come to are these.",
      "9": "As regards the first accused l we accept the opinions of Dr Chee KuanTsee and Dr N Nagulendran that at the time of the commission of the two murders, the first accused was not suffering from an abnormality of mind induced by the disease of the mind \u2013 manic depressive illness of the manic type. We are satisfied that at the material time the first accused was not suffering from any psychiatric illness. From the evidence we find, as Dr Chee said, the first accused was \u201cpurposeful in his pursuits, patient in his planning and persuasive in his performance for personal power and pleasure\u201d. We are revulsed by his abominable and depraved conduct.",
      "10": "Next, as regards the second accused, we find that there is evidence that when she lived with the first accused, there were occasions when she suffered from depression. But, on a balance of probabilities, we find that at the time when the second accused took part in the two murders, she was not suffering from reactive depressive psychosis. That which weighs heavily in our minds is that we had the benefit of hearing and seeing her give evidence in the witness box. The opinion we have of her is that she is an artful and wicked person. In conspiracy with the first accused, she was at all times a willing party to his loathsome and nefarious acts. We have also considered her case on the footing that she was suffering from the mental disease postulated by Dr Nagulendran. Even if she was suffering from abnormality of mind, we find that the abnormality was not such as substantially impaired her mental responsibility for her acts in the two killings.",
      "11": "Finally, in contrast to the second accused, the third accused is a simple person who can be easily influenced. It is claimed that the third accused is suffering from schizophrenia. Admittedly: there is a history of schizophrenia in her family. There is also evidence that she was in Woodbridge Hospital from about the end of May to the first week of July 1980. In the Hospital she was treated for schizophrenia. That diagnosis however is in issue between the psychiatrists. On the evidence before us, it appears that there are grounds for the disagreement. However, what comes out clearly in the evidence is that since her discharge from the Hospital, some six months before the commission of the offences, she was thereafter at all times in a state of remission. We accordingly have no difficulty in finding that even if the third accused had suffered from schizophrenia, at the time of the commission of the offences she was not suffering from an abnormality of mind as substantially impaired her mental responsibility for the two killings.",
      "12": "We accordingly find all the three accused guilty on the two charges of murder before us and they are convicted."

      "1": "On 14 September 2006 the accused was quarrelling with Low Siew Mui (\u201cLow\u201d) at the platform of the Clementi Mass Rapid Transit (\u201cMRT\u201d) station. It was 6.58pm at the time. The accused pushed Low who fell over the platform and onto the train tracks. She landed on her heels and immediately dashed across the tracks to the other side opposite the platform. As soon as she had crossed over the parapet enclosing the tracks on that side, an incoming train travelling at 50 or 60 km/h went by and had Low not crossed the tracks she would have been hit by the train and would most likely have been killed.",
      "2": "The accused was detained by other commuters and handed over to the police who eventually charged him for an offence under s 308 of the Penal Code , Chapter 224 as follows \u2013",
      "3": "On 24 May 2007 the accused pleaded guilty to the charge and admitted the statement of facts. The relevant facts were stated as follows. The accused had been dating Low for about two years prior to 14 September 2006, but several days prior to this date, Low told the accused that she wanted to end their relationship. On that day itself (14 September), the accused went to the Clementi Post Office where Low worked to talk about their relationship in the hope that it might be saved. They were unable to talk because Low was busy. It was only at 6pm when she left work that the accused got to speak to her but they quarrelled instead. Low rang her sister to accompany her home from the Clementi MRT station and so she walked to that station with the accused walking and quarrelling along the way until they reached the train platform, still quarrelling. It was at this point that the accused pushed her and she fell onto the tracks. A video clip of the incident was admitted as part of the statement of facts. The clip showed the facts as described.",
      "4": "The statement of facts stated that the accused \u201cknew that his act of pushing [Low Siew Mui] into the path of the oncoming MRT train was one that was so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death and committed the said act without any excuse for incurring the risk of [Low Siew Mui\u2019s] death\u201d (sic). These words referring to mens rea were taken from s 300(d) of the Penal Code, which is the provision for the offence of murder. The provision for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder is s 299, which, unlike s 300, has three sub-paragraphs instead of four. It is true that the psychiatrist had given his opinion that the accused \u201cwould qualify for the defence of diminished responsibility if [Low Siew Mui] had died and [the accused] was charged with murder.\u201d However, the accused was charged with attempted culpable homicide not amounting to murder and not with murder. The reference to the terms from the murder provision was thus inappropriate. However, for the purposes of sentencing, this error was not important. The statement of facts also stated that the accused was examined by Dr Tommy Tan, a psychiatrist with the Institute of Mental Health who was of the opinion that the accused \u2018was suffering from moderate depressive episode at the time of the offence\u2019. The psychiatrist was also of the view that the accused would qualify for the defence of diminished responsibility. The report of Dr Tan dated 27 September 2006 was exhibited as part of the statement of facts.",
      "5": "The accused can be described as an intelligent but shy person with psychological problems. It was not disputed that although he was an ASEAN scholar, he did not complete his \u2018A\u2019 levels examinations, and eventually went for university education overseas. He was described by Dr Tan as \u2018polite, cooperative and forthcoming\u2019. He had been treated by a psychiatrist since 2005 although the details of his early treatment were not known apart from the indication that he had been teased in school for the scars on his chest left on him as a result of a scalding incident occurring in childhood, and that he had been \u2018feeling depressed since he was young\u2019. Dr Tan reported that three days before the incident the accused went to his private psychiatrist Dr Lim Y C, who gave him electro-convulsive treatment two days later, that is, on 13 September, the day before the incident. The accused told Dr Tan that he did not try to kill Low and that it was \u201can accident\u201d. He said that he had only intended to scare her.",
      "6": "Dr Tan\u2019s opinion after his examination of the accused was as follows:",
      "7": "In the course of his mitigation plea Mr Shashi Nathan, counsel for the accused, referred to several cases, as did the DPP Mr Francis Ng in his response. Some of the cases concerned actual killings in which the accused persons were convicted and sentenced for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. PP v Katun Bee Bte S Ibrahim [2004] SGHC 46 was one of these. In that case, Woo J sentenced the accused to three years and six months imprisonment for stabbing a man to death. There were some cases that were more relevant in that they were cases of attempted culpable homicide not amounting to murder, that is under s 308 of the Penal Code as was the case before me. In PP v Chot Saik Kam [1990] SLR 756 the accused pleaded guilty to a charge under s 308 and was sentenced to three years imprisonment for stabbing his victim several times. In PP v Low Ah Fatt, Criminal Case No 36 of 1992 (unreported), another case under s 308, the accused was sentenced to three years and six months imprisonment for setting fire to a room and burning his landlady\u2019s son. In PP v Kee Hwee Lun, Criminal Case No 24 of 2001 (unreported) a 42-year old mother was fined $1,000 on each of two charges under s 308 for attempting to kill her three children, aged between three and six years. It will be obvious that these cases have disparate sentences ranging from a fine of $1,000 to imprisonment of three years and six months. It will also be obvious that the facts were quite disparate, and the mitigating factors might also have been different. There was certainly no previously known case similar on the facts as the present.",
      "8": "Mr Shashi Nathan informed the court that the accused had given a written apology to Low and had undertaken that he would no longer bother her. This letter was given to Low in the presence of the DPP. Mr Ng says that Low accepted the apology but had not forgiven the accused. I did not require Low to say so personally and prefer to take the more charitable view that even if she had not, she might do so some day. In the meantime, it was more important to consider that the accused\u2019s parents, who were in court, would be looking after the accused in Malaysia after he was released from prison, and that arrangements had been made by them to arrange for psychiatric care to be continued in Malaysia.",
      "9": "Under s 308, the punishment may extend to three years imprisonment and if hurt was caused, up to seven years. The charge on which this accused was convicted alleged that hurt was caused. The element of hurt in this case was identified from Low\u2019s statement during her medical examination that she had \u201cpain over her right calf associated with numbness\u201d. The statement of facts stated that when she was helped out of the MRT tracks shortly after the incident she \u201crealised that her right calf was sore and painful\u201d. Considering these statements and after watching the video clip, I am of the view that Low had probably pulled a muscle as she landed on the tracks. Whether an injury of this nature constitutes \u201churt\u201d in the context of the charge is not only a test of meaning, of which I think it will pass; it is also a test of judicial charity, of which I hope it will also pass. The DPP suggested a sentence between three to five years\u2019 imprisonment. I am mindful that the act of pushing someone onto a railway or MRT track is a dangerous act that endangers that person\u2019s life, but the act of endangering life alone is not the test. It will be seen that s 336 of the Penal Code provides specifically for the offence of doing an act that endangers life, and the punishment is imprisonment of up to three months, and if hurt was caused in the process, s 337 provides that the punishment will be imprisonment of up to six months. It is true that Low was fortunate to be alive. Her good fortune is thus also the good fortune of the accused. He might otherwise have faced a murder charge. The danger of the act was inherent in the charge and therefore should not be expanded to the extent that we punish the offender for what might have been instead of what was the fact. Dr Tan\u2019s opinion of the accused person\u2019s state of mind at the time of the offence must be considered in the context of the charge. Dr Tan stated that the accused \u201chad behaved impulsively at the time of the alleged [offence] because of his mental disorder\u201d. He did not think of the possible consequences of what he had done.\u201d That behaviour was, in his view, connected to the depressive illness that the accused had at the time. I think that a sentence of one year\u2019s imprisonment is sufficient punishment for this accused, a first offender."

      "2": "Due to scheduling difficulties, the trial took place over two blocks of dates.",
      "3": "The deceased Wan Cheon Kem (\u201cWan\u201d) was a driver employed by Sterling Agencies Pte Ltd. On the morning of 30 May 2006, Wan was tasked with delivering 10 pallets comprising 2,700 Sony Ericsson W700i handphones, valued at about US$823,500, from Changi Airfreight Centre (\u201cCAC\u201d) to a location near Henderson Road. Wan left CAC in his 24-footer lorry bearing registration number YM815 B (\u201clorry 815\u201d) with the consignment of handphones at around 6.50 a.m.",
      "4": "At around 8.52 a.m., a member of the public informed the police that he had seen a bloodied man inside a vehicle at Pasir Ris Carpark A. The police arrived soon thereafter at about 9.00 a.m. At that point in time, Wan was still conscious and managed to alight from the lorry on his own and to lie down on the grass verge next to his lorry. The police at the scene however noted that Wan was verbally unresponsive. He was then conveyed to hospital, where he later lost consciousness. Emergency surgery was performed on Wan but despite the surgery and the medical treatment rendered, he never regained consciousness and passed away on 5 June 2006.",
      "5": "The autopsy was performed by Dr Teo Eng Swee, a Consultant Forensic Pathologist with the Centre for Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority. In Dr Teo\u2019s autopsy report, the cause of death was recorded as \u201cintracranial haemorrhage and cerebral contusions with fractured skull\u201d. The report also noted a multitude of external injuries to the deceased head and limbs which Dr Teo attributed to being caused by blunt force trauma. On his internal examination of Wan\u2019s head, Dr Teo found the following (amongst others):\nSkull\nLeft frontal-parietal-temporal craniectomy.\nUnderlying lobes of the cerebral hemisphere herniated out through the craniectomy.\nHaemorrhage into the ethmoid and sphenoidal air sinuses.\nFracture from the right antero-lateral aspect of the craniectomy defect extending postero-laterally across the right side of the frontal bone to a point on the coronal suture and extending posteriorly to the right mastoid process.\nLinear fracture of the base of the skull, extending from the left postero-lateral aspect of the foramen magnum to the internal occipital protuberance.\nLinear fracture extending to the left transverse groove to the left of the midline.\nMeninges\nThere was an open durotomy underlying the craniectomy\nThere was a thin left subdural haemorrhage.\nThere were thin subtentorial subdural haemorrhages bilaterally.\nThere were thin diffuse subarachnoid haemorrhages bilaterally.\nBrain\nThe brain was severely oedematous, with a midline shift to the right. There was bilateral uncal subtentorial herniation.\nThere were extensive severe contusions of the left frontal and temporal lobes. Cut sections showed extensive haemorrhagic necrosis in the grey and white matter in these lobes, and of the left basal ganglia.\nThere was a contusion at the inferior surface of the region of the left temporal and occipital lobes. Cut sections showed haemorrhage into the underlying grey matter.\nThe cerebrospinal fluid was bloodstained.\nCut sections of the rest of the cerebrum showed scattered petechial haemorrhages with patchy pale infarction.\nCut sections of the cerebellum, pons and medulla showed scattered petechial haemorrhages with patchy pale infarction.",
      "6": "Based on the injuries found on Wan, Dr Teo opined that at least 15 blows had been inflicted on him. With regards to the three skull fractures, Dr Teo stated that it would require \u201cquite [a] severe force to cause fractures of the skull like this\u201d. As for the fractures found on the knuckles of both the deceased\u2019s hands, Dr Teo opined that they were consistent with defensive injuries and \u201cthe force [used] must have been quite severe\u201d.",
      "7": "Sometime in May 2006, one Ragu a/l Ramajayam (\u201cRagu\u201d) was introduced to one Arsan s/o Krishnasamy Govindarajoo (\u201cArsan\u201d a.k.a. \u201cBabu\u201d) by a mutual acquaintance. Arsan and Ragu then conspired to commit robbery of expensive cargo that was transported by drivers employed by Raju\u2019s employer, Sterling Agencies Pte Ltd. Ragu\u2019s role was to provide to Arsan inside information on the cargo being transported by the company\u2019s drivers.",
      "8": "Arsan later recruited the third accused to carry out the robbery. The third accused in turn recruited the first and second accused to assist him in executing the robbery. It is undisputed that prior to the robbery, the first accused along with the second and third accused had gone to a car workshop to collect the first accused\u2019s car which had been sent there for repairs earlier. A baseball bat was taken from the said workshop without the workshop owner\u2019s consent and that was subsequently used to assault Wan along Changi Coast Road.",
      "9": "On 30 May 2006 at around 5.30 a.m., Ragu contacted Arsan to inform him that a lorry would be carrying 10 pallets of handphones that morning out from CAC. Arsan relayed this information to the third accused, who was in his residence together with the first and second accused. The three accused persons thereafter proceeded to CAC in a rented 10-footer lorry bearing registration number GM9520 E (\u201clorry 9520\u201d). At the pass office just outside CAC, they met up with Arsan, who told them that the registration number of the lorry carrying the consignment of handphones was YM815 B.",
      "10": "At about 7.00 a.m., lorry 815 was seen emerging from CAC. For some unknown reason, the driver of lorry 815 did not stop at the pass office to surrender his entry pass, which was the normal procedure for those leaving CAC. The three accused persons then followed lorry 815 in their own lorry while Arsan drove off separately in another lorry. Somewhere along Changi Coast Road, between lamp posts number 113 and 115, the first accused staged an accident by cutting into the path of lorry 815 and then braking hard. Both lorry 815 and lorry 9520 came to a stop by the side of the road. After Wan had alighted from his lorry, he spoke to the second accused, who in turn told him to go speak to the third accused. When Wan approached the third accused who was standing near the passenger door of lorry 9520, he was repeatedly assaulted with a baseball bat held by the third accused. The unconscious victim was then carried into the cabin of lorry 815 by the three accused persons and dumped onto the floorboard in front of the passenger seat.",
      "11": "The first accused then drove lorry 815 to Pasir Ris Car Park A with the second accused and Wan on board while the third accused trailed them in lorry 9520. At the said Carpark A, the first and third accused transferred two pallets, comprising 540 pieces of handphones, from lorry 815 to lorry 9520. The third accused then instructed the second accused to drive lorry 9520 with the two pallets on board to the first accused\u2019s rented flat in Ang Mo Kio housing estate.",
      "12": "Shortly thereafter, Arsan arrived at Car Park A in his lorry. The remaining eight pallets of handphones were transferred onto Arsan\u2019s lorry. Arsan then left the carpark in his lorry with the first and third accused on board, while the injured Wan was left in the passenger cabin of lorry 815. None of the accused persons or Arsan summoned aid for Wan at any point of time. The first and third accused subsequently alighted from Arsan\u2019s lorry and met up with the second accused at Ang Mo Kio, where they proceeded to transfer the two pallets on board lorry 9520 to the first accused\u2019s rented flat.",
      "13": "That same afternoon, the third accused suggested to the first and second accused to sell their cache of stolen handphones (i.e. the two pallets) and they agreed. The third accused then sold 20 of the handphones to an acquaintance for $5,000. Out of the sale proceeds, an amount of $1,500 was handed over to the first accused that night. The second accused was given $500. The next day, the third accused sold another 20 handphones to a different acquaintance for $5,600. He was arrested by the police that same evening. Thereafter, the other participants to the robbery were swiftly taken into police custody. Ragu and Arsan were arrested separately on 1 June 2006, while the first and second accused surrendered to the police separately on the morning of 5 June 2006. Ragu and Arsan have since been dealt with in court for their respective roles in the robbery and so have those who were involved in the black market sale and purchase of the illegally obtained handphones.",
      "14": "Following their arrest and/or surrender, the accused persons each made several statements pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed). During the trial, the Prosecution sought to introduce these statements in evidence. The first accused mounted a challenge to the admissibility of four of his statements. Save for these statements, the remaining statements made by the three accused were not challenged as to their admissibility and were accordingly admitted as evidence. As for the four challenged statements, a trial-within-a-trial was conducted to determine their admissibility.",
      "15": "The first accused challenged the admissibility of the following statements recorded from him:",
      "16": "It is trite law that the Prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that an accused\u2019s statement was voluntarily made and in compliance with the law. The only requirement on the Defence in this regard is to bring to light the alleged offending conduct of the recording officers or the untoward circumstances under which the statement was made. If the issues raised by the Defence give rise to an inference or a nagging suspicion that the statement was not made voluntarily, then the statement must be held to be inadmissible: see Zailani bin Ahmad v Public Prosecutor [2005] 1 SLR 356 at [43].",
      "17": "The admissibility of the first disputed statement was challenged on the ground that the first accused did not know the contents of the statement as he was drunk at the time the statement was recorded. He also claimed that a friend of his cousin had told him to cooperate with the police and that the recording officer wrote the statement but did not read it back to him (the first accused). It was further alleged that prior to the recording of the second statement, the first accused was threatened with a murder charge if he did not cooperate with the recording officer. The first accused said that he thought what the recording officer had recorded was the truth and he therefore signed the statement although it was not read back to him. As for the third disputed statement, it was alleged that the recording officer had told the first accused that the murder charge would be reduced to one of robbery if he agreed with the officer\u2019s version of events. The first accused signed the statement because he thought that the officer was helping him. Further, the first accused claimed that he was not given the full opportunity to amend the said statement. Similarly, for the fourth disputed statement, the recording officer promised to reduce the charge of murder to one of robbery if he cooperated. It was further alleged that another accused person was being assaulted in the room next to the one that the first accused was in and the recording officer threatened the first accused with the same treatment if he refused to cooperate.",
      "18": "The fact that an accused had consumed alcohol prior to the making of a statement would not in itself render the statement involuntary unless he was in a state of near delirium such that his mind did not go with the statements that he was making. This follows logically from Garnam Singh v PP [1994] 2 SLR 243, where the Court of Appeal held that in order for drug withdrawal symptoms to render a statement involuntary, the person must be in a state of near delirium when the statement was made. In this regard, the officer who recorded the first and second disputed statements (\u201cthe first recording officer\u201d) candidly admitted that the first accused smelled of alcohol when the first disputed statement was being recorded. He however maintained that the first accused did not appear to be either drunk or drowsy and was in fact able to give coherent answers. Further, the Prosecution submitted that the court ought to draw an adverse inference in relation to the first accused\u2019s failure to call any witnesses who could give evidence on the first accused\u2019s mental state prior to his surrender to the police. These witnesses would include the first accused\u2019s cousin and younger brother, who were with him up to the time of his surrender to the police. I agreed with the Prosecution\u2019s submission on this point. In my view, the first accused could not have been so drunk or drowsy that he did not know the contents of the first disputed statement.",
      "19": "As for the alleged non-compliance with s 121(3) of the CPC, the first recording officer stated that the first accused was allowed to read his own statements and was given the opportunity to make alterations and additions to the said statements. Earlier in PP v Leong Siew Chor [2006] 3 SLR 290, I stated at [90] that the failure to read back a statement would not render the statement inadmissible so long as the maker of the statement was given the opportunity and time to go through what was recorded and to made amendments to the statement if necessary. I added that it was probably easier for the accused to read the statement himself at his own pace rather than to listen to the recording officer reading it. As the first accused was literate in English and the two disputed statements were clearly legible, I was of the view that a technical breach of s 121(3) did not amount to a procedural impropriety that would render the two statements inadmissible. I also rejected the allegation that the first accused was threatened with a murder charge by the first recording officer prior to the recording of the second disputed statement for the following reasons. First, this particular allegation was not put to the said recording officer when he was on the witness stand and second, even if such a threat had indeed been made, the first accused would have known that it was an empty threat as he had already been charged with murder a day earlier: see Tan Yew Lee v PP [1995] 2 SLR 121 at [20]. He could not therefore have been influenced by any such threat at any rate.",
      "20": "The alleged advice from the first accused\u2019s cousin\u2019s friend, not any of the recording officers, that he should cooperate with the police could not be sufficient to give the first accused any hope that he would gain some advantage or avoid some ill by making the first disputed statement. The third and fourth disputed statements were recorded by a different officer. The first accused\u2019s evidence in court showed that no threat, inducement or promise was made when the third disputed statement was recorded. This is apparent from the responses he gave to his own counsel during his examination in chief:",
      "21": "That being the case, I did not think it was open to the first accused to suggest that the third disputed statement was tainted by an offer of a lesser charge as such a suggestion would be inconsistent with his own testimony in court.",
      "22": "As for the allegation that the first accused was not given the full opportunity to amend the third disputed statement, I note that at the start of the recording of the fourth disputed statement, the third disputed statement was read back to the first accused and he was asked if he wished to make any addition, correction, deletion or amendments to the said statement. As can be seen, clarifications to the third disputed statement were in fact made in the later statement. Further, on 17 June 2006 when a further investigation statement was recorded from the first accused, the third disputed statement was again read back to the first accused and he was asked again if he wished to make any amendments to that statement. In this 17 June 2006 statement, admissibility of which was not disputed by the defence, the first accused again made several clarifications to the third disputed statement. The first accused was therefore given not one but two opportunities to amend the third disputed statement and on both occasions, amendments were in fact made. In the premises, I was satisfied that the first accused had been given the full opportunity to amend the third disputed statement.",
      "23": "This leaves us with the fourth disputed statement which was challenged on the ground that during the recording of the statement, an inducement or promise was made to the first accused by way of an offer to reduce the charge of murder to one of robbery. It was further alleged that another accused person was being assaulted in the room next to the one that the first accused was in and the recording officer threatened the first accused with the same treatment if he refused to cooperate. The first accused\u2019s credibility was again called into question by his failure to put these allegations to the recording officer. I had no hesitation in accepting the evidence of the recording officer that no such inducement, promise or threat took place.",
      "24": "In the circumstances, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the four disputed statements made by the first accused were made voluntarily and I accordingly admitted them as evidence.",
      "25": "Apart from the four statements made by the accused admitted at the conclusion of the trial-within-a-trial, two other statements were admitted unchallenged. The material portions of the first accused\u2019s written statements are reproduced below:",
      "26": "The material portions of the second accused\u2019s written statements are:",
      "27": "The material portions of the third accused\u2019s written statements are:",
      "28": "The first accused stated in court that sometime in May 2006, the third accused told him of a plan to \u201ctake away\u201d a lorry carrying handphones and laptops out from CAC. He agreed to be part of the plan as he was then in financial straits. The first accused testified that the original plan was to simply steal the lorry while the lorry driver was changing his pass at the CAC pass office. This plan however failed when lorry 815 did not stop at the pass-office.",
      "29": "According to the first accused, after lorry 815 failed to stop at the pass-office, the third accused instructed him to tail the lorry. Somewhere along Changi Coast Road, the third accused told him to overtake and intercept lorry 815. The first accused complied. After both lorry 815 and lorry 9520 had come to a stop, the first accused remained in his lorry while the second and third accused alighted. It was through the left side mirror that the first accused saw the third accused holding a baseball bat and then striking the deceased once on the face using the bat. The first accused stated that he did not question the third accused when he was told to tail the 24-footer from the Cargo Complex as the third accused was elder to him and that he did not do anything to stop the third accused\u2019s assault on the deceased as he was shocked.",
      "30": "The first accused\u2019s counsel submitted that the only plan the first accused was privy to was the plan to snatch the deceased\u2019s lorry at the CAC pass-office and \u201cthere was no pre-arranged plan to beat up the victim till he was unconscious\u201d. It was further submitted that the Prosecution had adduced no evidence to show that the first accused had a common intention with the second and third accused persons to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased. Thus, counsel\u2019s written submissions concluded with the suggestion that the 1st Accused \u201cbe found guilty of the lower charge of robbery, if not, manslaughter\u201d.",
      "31": "The second accused testified that he was not privy to the plan to rob the lorry carrying the handphones and that he was merely an ignorant replacement driver. This assertion was corroborated somewhat by the third accused who testified in court that the second accused was a last minute replacement for one \u201cShankar\u201d who was supposed to be involved in the plan but who could not wake up that particular morning. The third accused added that the second accused\u2019s role was only to send the first and third accused to CAC and nothing more. The reason why the second accused made the various incriminating police statements was because during their time in police custody, the first accused had disclosed to the second accused the contents of his police statements and in his confused statement of mind, the second accused decided to give an account that tallied with the first accused\u2019s.",
      "32": "The third accused admitted that he struck the deceased with the baseball bat. Counsel submitted that the defence of the third accused was as follows:",
      "33": "The defence also contended that it was not within the contemplation of all three accused persons to use the baseball bat to assault Wan and to cause him serious injury. It was also submitted that certain police statements (exhibits 251, 255 and 257) made by the third accused ought to be disregarded as: the statements were not verified by the third accused; the statements were not recorded with the assistance of an interpreter; the statements were paraphrased by the recording officer and in some instances, the recorder even used words of his own; and/or the recorder did not administer a warning that the statements were recorded in the course of a murder investigation. Counsel urged the court to acquit the third accused.",
      "34": "Counsel for the first accused urged the court to give no weight to the statement of facts which Arsan admitted to earlier as part of his plea of guilt to a charge under Section 394 read with Section 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), as it was said that Arsan admitted to the statement of facts in order to escape a charge of murder. In view of Arsan\u2019s testimony in court and the circumstances in which the said statement of facts was admitted to, I was of the view that it would be prudent to accord little or no weight to it.",
      "35": "I am mindful of the fact that in the course of their court testimony, all three accused persons retracted various incriminating portions of their statements. The law on retracted statements has been expounded upon extensively in Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP [2006] 4 SLR 45 at [84] \u2013 [86].",
      "36": "In the course of the investigations, the first accused made several statements which incriminated him as being privy to a plan to assault and rob Wan. He however denied in court that there was such a plan. According to him, the plan was simply to hijack Wan\u2019s lorry at the pass-office. Thus, the first accused sought to retract portions of his statements which evinced that he was privy to a plan to assault and rob the deceased. His reason for doing so is as follows:",
      "37": "While I was satisfied that there was some discussion among the accused persons in relation to hijacking Wan\u2019s lorry at the pass-office, the evidence showed that the plan among the three accused persons and Babu had changed by the time of the evening before the crime. The new plan was to forcibly take over the goods-laden lorry while making sure that the driver thereof would be unable to stop them or recognize them. In any event, it was clear among all three accused persons that the new plan had to be executed when lorry 815 did not stop at the pass-office and when the third accused directed the first accused to tail the said lorry.",
      "38": "As for the first accused\u2019s assertion that the assault on Wan was unexpected, one has to be conscious of the fact that the first accused was in control of lorry 9520 when the three accused persons tailed Wan\u2019s lorry. He was also the one who staged the near accident along Changi Coast Road. While the first accused stated in court that he was shocked and put in fear by the third accused\u2019s assault on Wan, this crucial fact was not mentioned in any of his written statements. Instead, the police statements showed that the first accused knew of the assault beforehand.",
      "39": "If the first accused had indeed been shocked by the allegedly unexpected turn of events, one would expect him to be even more shocked by the sight of a badly wounded and bloodied victim. The first accused\u2019s subsequent actions however negated the assertion of shock. Instead of asking the third accused why he did what he did to Wan, the first accused helped to lift Wan into lorry 815, pushed Wan\u2019s head down at least a couple of times when he seemed to have recovered consciousness, drove the said lorry to Pasir Ris Carpark A and then helped transfer the handphones onto both lorry 9520 and Arsan\u2019s lorry. The fact that he subsequently went clubbing and drinking that same evening should also be borne in mind in determining what his state of mind was that morning. In the circumstances, I disbelieved the first accused\u2019s assertion that he made the incriminating statements as he thought that the recorders of the statements were helping him. I was of the view that what he told the police was the truth, that he was privy to the robbery plan and that he knew that the victim would be assaulted as part of the plan.",
      "40": "The second accused\u2019s statements implicated him as being part of the robbery plan. This was corroborated by the statements made by the first and third accused persons. Indeed, the third accused had told the police that the second accused was aware of a plan to steal handphones on the day he drove Arsan and the third accused to CAC to survey the location. Similarly, the first accused\u2019s testimony in court contradicted the second accused\u2019s contention that he was an ignorant last minute replacement.",
      "41": "Further, the second accused was present at the Toa Payoh coffeeshop on the night prior to the robbery where, according to the statements made by all three accused persons, the robbery plans were discussed. The second accused\u2019s oral evidence that he was talking on his phone to his girlfriend for an hour on his pre-paid line on the night prior to the robbery was likewise unconvincing. Also, if the second accused\u2019s role was to simply chauffeur the first and third accused to CAC, why then did he remain with the rest after his task was done and why did he put on the pair of gloves handed to him by the third accused? Further, why did the second accused only seek to retract paragraph 9 of his 12 June 2006 statement but not the remaining alleged fabricated parts of his statements?",
      "42": "I found the second accused\u2019s assertion that he had made the incriminating portions of his statements so as to tally his statements with that of the first accused\u2019s to be inherently unbelievable. In my view, while I accepted that the second accused\u2019s role in the heist was that of a driver, the evidence showed that he was clearly privy to the robbery plan. This was evident from the oral testimony of the first and third accused and corroborated by the second accused\u2019s continued presence at CAC and his conduct during and after the encounter with the victim.",
      "43": "While the third accused admitted that he had struck the deceased with the baseball bat, his counsel submitted that he had no intention to commit murder and to cause the death of the victim. While I accepted that none of the three accused persons intended to cause Wan\u2019s death, this did not mean that they will not be guilty under s 300(c) of the Penal Code. In PP v Lim Poh Lye [2005] 4 SLR 582 at [17], the Court of Appeal reaffirmed the seminal decision of Virsa Singh v State of Punjab AIR 1958 SC 465, which held that four elements must be proved to establish liability under s 300(c). They are:",
      "44": "The third accused admitted that he hit Wan twice. He also agreed that whatever injuries that were found on Wan\u2019s body were caused by his assault. In this regard, the pathologist Dr Teo testified that, in his view, at least fifteen blows were inflicted on Wan and that the injuries to Wan\u2019s head were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. As it was clear from the evidence that the injuries found on Wan were intentionally inflicted, the requirements under s 300(c) of the Penal Code were therefore satisfied.",
      "45": "This brings us to the defences raised by the third accused. With regard the statutory defence of sudden fight under Exception 4 to s 300, the Court of Appeal in Tan Chun Seng v PP [2003] 2 SLR 506 stated at [16] that while it was immaterial as to which party offered the provocation or committed the first assault, three main ingredients must be present to invoke the defence. They are: (a) sudden fight, heat of passion, sudden quarrel; (b) absence of premeditation; and (c) no undue advantage or cruel or unusual acts.",
      "46": "On the evidence, the interception of Wan\u2019s lorry and the subsequent assault on him by the third accused were clearly premeditated. The third accused was well aware of the circumstances leading to his encounter with Wan. He directed the first accused to follow Wan\u2019s lorry and somewhere along Changi Coast Road, told the first accused to stage an accident between the two lorries. These actions were all done with the ultimate aim of forcibly taking away the cargo of handphones.",
      "47": "In any event, the first accused told the police that prior to any contact between the third accused and Wan, the third accused had already taken the baseball bat from the lorry and was trying to hide the bat behind his left leg. It is pertinent to note that the first accused did not retract this portion of his statement in his oral testimony. Instead, when cross-examined by the Prosecution on this point, the first accused maintained that he saw the third accused holding the bat but did not know whether the third accused was actually going to use the bat on Wan or whether it would be used to merely threaten Wan. Similarly, the second accused told the police that he knew the victim would be beaten up by the third accused when he told him to go to where the third accused was.",
      "48": "The fact that the third accused was pre-armed with the baseball bat left no doubt that the assault on Wan was a premeditated one. Likewise, the multiple forceful blows inflicted on the unarmed and defenceless victim showed that the assault was nothing short of being cruel. On these two scores, the defence of sudden fight was clearly not available to the third accused.",
      "49": "I shall consider the issue of whether there was in fact a sudden fight in conjunction with the defence of grave and sudden provocation under Exception 1 to s 300. In this regard, the third accused testified in court that just before the assault took place, Wan provoked him by abusing his (the third accused\u2019s) mother using Hokkien vulgarities and pushing him on his left shoulder.",
      "50": "In PP v Kwan Cin Cheng [1998] 2 SLR 345, the Court of Appeal held that there are two distinct requirements for the defence to apply: first, a subjective requirement that the accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation; secondly, an objective requirement that the provocation should have been \u201cgrave and sudden\u201d. On the second criterion, the court cautioned at [65] that:",
      "51": "As noted earlier, the attack on Wan by the third accused was clearly a premeditated one as the third accused had every intention to assault him the moment he got off the lorry along Changi Coast Road. Wan was the only impediment to the robbery and had to be overpowered quickly as the lorries were on a public road in clear daylight. It was evident that the third accused did not assault Wan as a result of being deprived of his self-control by Wan\u2019s alleged aggression. It was highly unlikely that Wan had behaved in a provocative manner. First, he was out-numbered. Second, the allegation that Wan was aggressive was not mentioned in the statements of any of the accused persons. Third, the allegedly provocative behaviour of Wan was not corroborated by the first or the second accused. It is pertinent to note that the second accused did not even allude to any aggression on the part of Wan during his examination-in-chief:",
      "52": "It was only when the second accused was subsequently cross-examined by counsel for the third accused that he added that Wan was shouting at him and behaving in an aggressive manner. This later evidence did not fit well with what the second accused had told the court earlier. There was, in any event, no mention that Wan was uttering vulgarities. In the circumstances, I disbelieved the evidence of the third accused that Wan was the aggressor during their encounter that fateful morning. There was no sudden fight. Wan was attacked and rendered unconscious even before he knew what was coming. The third accused therefore failed in his defences of sudden fight and of grave and sudden provocation.",
      "53": "Are the first and the second accused liable in law for the acts of the third accused? Section 34 of the Penal Code reads:",
      "54": "In Lee Chez Kee v PP [2008] SGCA 20, a decision handed down by the Court of Appeal after the conclusion of the present trial, the court said (at [253]):",
      "55": "The evidence before me more than sufficed to impute liability of the third accused\u2019s actions to the first and the second accused. There was clearly a common intention among all three accused persons to commit robbery. The three accused persons knew that violence would be necessary to overpower and incapacitate Wan (to the extent he would not be able to resist and to identify them) in order to facilitate the commission of the robbery, even if the first and the second accused were not aware of the third accused\u2019s \u201cactual method of execution\u201d. The brutal assault was undoubtedly in furtherance of their common intention to commit robbery of the goods in lorry 815.",
      "56": "In Too Yin Sheong v PP [1999] 1 SLR 682, the Court of Appeal astutely noted at [27] that \u201c[t]he reason why all are deemed guilty in such cases is, the presence of accomplices gives encouragement, support and protection to the person actually committing the act.\u201d The first and the second accused were no doubt participants in the robbery: the first accused staged the accident and was acting as a look out while Wan was being assaulted; the second accused directed Wan to the third accused with full knowledge of the robbery plan and the fact that Wan would be assaulted by the third accused. There was no expression of horror or surprise on their part after Wan was battered brutally by the third accused. The first and the second accused were calm and purposeful in their actions. They helped to bundle Wan into his lorry before bringing it to the intended destination. The first accused was able to drive a stranger\u2019s lorry and yet retained the presence of mind to push Wan\u2019s head down at least twice when he tried to get up. He was also able to help offload two pallets from lorry 815 onto their own lorry at Pasir Ris Carpark A before Babu arrived. The second accused was then able to drive away their lorry with the two pallets to their planned destination. There was no talk about what was going to happen to Wan if they left the badly wounded man in his lorry. Clearly, Wan was just someone they had to get rid of although they did not plan to kill him. Once they had got hold of the goods, they were completely nonchalant about the fate of the obviously badly injured Wan.",
      "57": "In the circumstances, I was of the view that pursuant to s 34 of the Penal Code, the first and second accused persons were liable for the actions of the third accused in the same manner as if the acts were done by them and that all three accused persons were equally culpable.",
      "58": "For all the foregoing reasons, I held that all three accused persons were guilty as charged. Accordingly, I convicted them and passed the mandatory death sentence on them."

      "1": "The accused is an Indonesian woman born on 15 May 1979. She was working in Singapore as a domestic helper at the material time. She pleaded guilty to the following charge:",
      "2": "The accused was represented in these proceedings by Senior Counsel and his assistants. She was also assisted throughout the court hearing by an interpreter who spoke Bahasa Indonesia.",
      "3": "Wee Keng Wah (\u201cWee\u201d), the deceased female victim mentioned in the charge, was residing in unit #09-328, a 2-bedroom flat in Block 19 Chai Chee Road (\u201cthe HDB block\u201d), with her 78 year old husband, Lee Tang Seng (\u201cWee\u2019s husband\u201d). Their four children had their own homes elsewhere. Wee\u2019s husband\u2019s age and multiple medical problems (including Parkinson\u2019s disease, weak limbs, severely impaired hearing, diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease) made it necessary for someone to look after him. For that purpose, the accused was employed as a domestic helper by Wee on 20 September 2005. The accused slept in Wee\u2019s husband\u2019s bedroom in order to attend to him during the night. As a result, Wee and her husband slept in separate bedrooms in the flat.",
      "4": "The accused had previously worked in Singapore with three other families. The first was a Malay family living in Bukit Batok, for whom she worked for 16 months between January 2000 and April 2001. In 2003, the accused went to Malaysia to work as a domestic helper for around one year. In September 2004, she returned to Singapore to work for the second family living in Frankel Estate. After about six months, her services were terminated as she was unable to communicate well in English and was forgetful. In March 2005, she was sent to work for a third employer living in a condominium in the eastern part of Singapore. That lasted a few months. On 20 September 2005, the accused started working for Wee, her fourth employer in Singapore in her five years here.",
      "5": "In the morning of 19 October 2005, Wee was found lying in a pool of blood at the foot of the HDB block. The cleaner who saw her body informed a resident living in a ground-floor unit of the HDB block. That resident then informed the police.",
      "6": "Police officers arrived at the scene. They then proceeded to Wee\u2019s flat on the ninth floor. There, they found Wee\u2019s husband who was teary and in a state of shock. The police officers went into Wee\u2019s bedroom and noted that the metal grilles of the bedroom window (which was directly above where Wee\u2019s body was found) were closed but not locked.",
      "7": "The accused was in the flat. She told the police officers that at around 4.30am, she found Wee lying on the floor inside Wee\u2019s bedroom. She tried to rouse Wee but the latter merely moved her hands. As the accused was not able to carry Wee onto the bed, she lifted her body to a sitting position leaning against a bedroom wall. She also claimed that Wee\u2019s husband was present in Wee\u2019s bedroom then. She then went out of the flat with Wee\u2019s husband to seek assistance from a neighbour (Richard Chew) living two doors away. When they returned to the flat, Wee was no longer there.",
      "8": "The police managed to glean the following information from Wee\u2019s husband. According to him, at about 3am on 19 October 2005, he needed to urinate. He therefore called for the accused but she did not appear to be around. He then shouted to Wee who was in her bedroom. Wee went to attend to him. She was upset and angry that the accused was not in the flat.",
      "9": "Not long thereafter, the accused returned to the flat. Wee scolded her for leaving the flat. Wee\u2019s husband tried to pacify Wee, advising her to speak to the accused at daybreak. He then went back to bed.",
      "10": "Sometime past 4am that same morning, Wee\u2019s husband needed to urinate again. He shouted to get the attention of the accused and of Wee but no one responded to his calls. He got up from his bed and walked slowly to the living room. As he passed Wee\u2019s bedroom, he noticed Wee lying on the floor therein. The accused, who was walking from the direction of the toilet located in the kitchen area, attempted to stop him from entering Wee\u2019s bedroom, claiming that Wee was asleep and did not want to be disturbed. However, Wee\u2019s husband insisted on going into Wee\u2019s bedroom and the accused relented. Wee was lying on the floor, unconscious but breathing. Sensing that something was amiss, he walked to Richard Chew\u2019s flat to seek help.",
      "11": "When Wee\u2019s husband returned to his flat with Richard Chew, Wee was not in the flat anymore. The accused then informed Wee\u2019s husband that Wee usually went for her morning exercise at that time. Some time later that morning, the police arrived in the flat to inform Wee\u2019s husband about Wee\u2019s body having been found at the foot of the HDB block.",
      "12": "The police officers at the scene decided to inform the Special Investigation Section of the Criminal Investigation Department (\u201cCID\u201d). The CID officer brought the accused to Chai Chee Neighbourhood Police Post where she was interviewed again. Due to the numerous inconsistencies in her narration of the events and in the light of preliminary investigations, the accused was treated as a suspect. She was brought to the CID where hand swabs were done and her fingernail clippings were taken.",
      "13": "Investigations conducted on and after 19 October 2005 revealed the following evidence pointing to foul play in Wee\u2019s death and militated against the possibility of suicide. As Wee\u2019s body was found directly below her bedroom window, that suggested that it had been dropped from a height. If Wee had jumped out of her bedroom window, her body would have landed further away from the base of the HDB block. The grime-like dirt stains on the right sleeve and the right rear portion of her t-shirt were similar to the grime-like dirt stains found on the top of the air-conditioning compressor installed directly outside the bedroom window, with a drop of 22.2cm from the window ledge. That suggested that Wee\u2019s right upper back had been in contact with the top of the compressor. The top of the compressor also had a fresh drag mark on its left. If Wee had committed suicide, one would have expected to find some evidence of contact between her feet and/or her hands and the compressor. However, there were no foot or hand prints found on the top of the compressor. All the above evidence suggested that Wee had been pushed sideways out of the bedroom window.",
      "14": "In Wee\u2019s bedroom, several tiny blood droplets and blood stains were found on the wall and the floor near the window and at the lower portion of a cupboard. There were also blood stains on the bed sheet and on both sides of a pillow case lying on the bed. All the blood droplets and stains were later established to have come from Wee. Strands of Wee\u2019s hair were found along the floor skirting below the window. A plastic rack with rollers had been toppled and had broken into pieces, with its contents scattered about in the bedroom. There was therefore evidence of some fight or struggle having taken place inside the bedroom.",
      "15": "A resident living in the flat directly above Wee\u2019s informed the police that at about 4am on 19 October 2005, she was awakened by some loud noise coming from Wee\u2019s flat, lasting a few minutes. It sounded like someone was choking. Another resident living one floor below Wee\u2019s flat said that she was studying for her examinations that morning when she heard a loud thud coming from above her flat. After that, there was a dragging sound lasting several seconds.",
      "16": "The autopsy report on Wee revealed that she had multiple bruises on the front of her body, consistent with having fallen from height. The front of her face was flattened. Several abrasions resembling fingernail marks were found on the left of her neck, indicating the possibility of strangulation. The pathologist certified that death resulted from the multiple injuries. He was also of the opinion that Wee had been strangled before she was thrown down the HDB block and that she was alive, although possibly unconscious, when the injuries from the fall were suffered.",
      "17": "There was no dispute that the accused had not been ill-treated by Wee or any other member of her family during the one month of her employment. Police investigations revealed that on the night of the incident, the accused sneaked out of the flat to meet her boyfriend. When she returned to the flat, Wee scolded her for leaving the flat late at night. The accused was unhappy with the scolding and therefore retorted that Wee could ask her (Wee\u2019s) son to send her back to the maid agency the next day. The verbal exchange continued for some time and then escalated into a struggle between the two women in Wee\u2019s bedroom. The accused confirmed that the multiple superficial abrasions on her face and arms were caused during her struggle with Wee. This was supported by the forensic findings that Wee\u2019s and the accused\u2019s fingernail clippings were stained with each other\u2019s DNA. The accused admitted in statements made by her to the police that after her struggle with Wee, Wee fainted but was still breathing as the accused could see Wee\u2019s chest and abdomen moving and could hear some sounds coming from Wee.",
      "18": "The accused left Wee lying unconscious on the bedroom floor and went to Wee\u2019s husband\u2019s bedroom. Shortly after that, Wee\u2019s husband wanted to go into Wee\u2019s bedroom but was blocked by the accused from doing so as she knew that Wee was unconscious on the bedroom floor. When Wee\u2019s husband persisted in going into Wee\u2019s bedroom, the accused allowed him to do so.",
      "19": "Wee\u2019s husband was shocked by what he saw. He asked the accused what had happened to Wee but the accused claimed that she did not know. The accused then tried to revive Wee by slapping her cheeks and her legs. Wee\u2019s husband asked the accused to call for assistance by dialling \u201cthree nine\u201d but the accused claimed that she did not understand that meant to dial nine, nine, nine. Wee\u2019s husband then returned to his bedroom and activated the portable personal alarm given to him by the residents\u2019 committee in that area for use in an emergency. He then asked the accused to open the grille gates of the flat so that he could go and seek assistance. He stood at the locked grille gates and shook them repeatedly while calling out for assistance. Eventually, the accused opened the gates for him and he proceeded gingerly towards Richard Chew\u2019s flat two doors away.",
      "20": "The accused went out of the flat with Wee\u2019s husband but did not accompany him to Richard Chew\u2019s flat to seek assistance. She went back into Wee\u2019s bedroom, carried the still unconscious Wee onto the bed (the width of which was next to the window) and then pushed her out of the window. She then shut the window grilles and left Wee\u2019s bedroom.",
      "21": "When Wee\u2019s husband returned to the flat with Richard Chew, they searched the flat for Wee but could not find her. In reply to Richard Chew, the accused said that she did not know where Wee was. Later, she told the two men that Wee had gone for her morning exercise. She repeated these conflicting answers on Wee\u2019s whereabouts to the police and to Wee\u2019s family members several times that morning when she was asked.",
      "22": "After her arrest, the accused was sent for psychiatric evaluation. Dr Tommy Tan, a consultant at the Woodbridge Hospital, examined her over four occasions in November 2005. He reported that the accused was forthcoming, polite and cooperative and that her behaviour and appearance were appropriate. She described her mood as sad and was tearful during part of the examination. She explained that she felt sad because she missed home and her child and was worried. She was relevant and rational and did not have any psychotic symptoms and was able to give an account of the incident.",
      "23": "Dr Tommy Tan opined that the accused did not have a mental disorder before and at the time of the offence and was not of unsound mind at the material time. However, she had a depressive reaction (F43.2, International Classification of Diseases, edition 10) caused by her arrest and remand. It was characterised by a depressed mood, worries about her future and her mother and missing her home and her child. Dr Tommy Tan found the accused fit to plead and capable of making her defence and instructing counsel.",
      "24": "Dr R Nagulendran, a psychiatrist in private practice and consultant psychiatrist to the National University of Singapore Health Service, was engaged by defence counsel to examine the accused. In his report dated 19 March 2007, Dr Nagulendran stated that he examined the accused on three occasions in October 2006. She married around 1995 when she was 16 years old. Her husband worked in Malaysia as a labourer. In August 2003, the accused started a relationship with another married Indonesian man and gave birth to a baby boy. That man wanted the accused to be his second wife but that was not acceptable to her and so she broke up with him. The baby boy was given away to a friend.",
      "25": "The accused told the defence psychiatrist that she discovered later that her husband was also having an extra-marital relationship. For some months before the accused became employed by Wee in September 2005, she was experiencing depressed mood and guilt feelings concerning her own and her husband\u2019s unfaithfulness. In June or July 2005, she met Ali, a Bangladeshi man who befriended her. She became intimate with him and that increased her feelings of guilt. On the night leading to the offence, she had gone out to meet Ali to tell him that she wanted to break up with him. However, Ali did not want to break up. She was therefore \u201ctroubled\u201d. She has since given birth to a baby girl (in May 2006) while in remand.",
      "26": "The accused also told the defence psychiatrist that she was tired while working in Wee\u2019s household because her sleep was interrupted by Wee\u2019s husband\u2019s constant need to urinate at night. She felt then like returning to her country. When asked if she had any suicidal thoughts, she replied that it was against her religion. From March to September 2005, she kept a diary (in two notebooks) in which she penned her thoughts and feelings, mainly in Bahasa Indonesia. The defence psychiatrist had read the English translation of the entries in the diary. The accused further stated that Wee was angrily scolding and nagging her when she returned to the flat on the night of the incident. She was initially ashamed and afraid when first confronted by Wee but with the continuous anger displayed by Wee, the accused felt increasingly depressed. She wanted to stop the tirade by telling Wee that she could let her son know about her night out and ask him to inform her agent to take her back. That did not stop Wee. The accused then realized that she would lose her job if Wee informed her son about the matter. The first three months of her wages were going to be paid to the agent and she would have no income until the fourth month of work. She therefore asked Wee not to inform her son about it. The accused\u2019s state of mind was aggravated by this impending financial loss.",
      "27": "She also felt angry when Wee pushed her and swung a bag (a cloth pouch) at her, hurting her abdomen. When Wee hit her head against the wall and the floor and then became motionless, the accused became frightened.",
      "28": "At the time of examination, the accused was rational and relevant. She expressed sadness at Wee\u2019s death and was tearful during the course of the three sessions. There was no impairment of her cognitive functions of memory, attention, concentration, insight and intelligence. Dr Nagulendran concluded that at the time of the offence, the accused was suffering from severe reactive depression. Although this condition did not amount to unsoundness of mind, it was an abnormality of mind of such severity as to have substantially impaired her mental responsibility, thereby allowing the accused to plead diminished responsibility. She was found fit to plead.",
      "29": "The report from the defence psychiatrist and the accused\u2019s translated diary entries (the latter being unavailable earlier as they had been sent for translation to be done and were not ready at the time of Dr Tommy Tan\u2019s first report) were referred to Dr Tommy Tan to see if they affected his opinion. In his supplemental report of 5 April 2007, Dr Tommy Tan stated that there was information in Dr Nagulendran\u2019s report that the accused had not informed him about earlier during the interviews, probably because she was then in the custody of CID and wanted to maintain with Dr Tommy Tan the same account that she had given to the CID. Dr Tommy Tan reported:",
      "30": "As a result of Dr Tommy Tan\u2019s further report, the prosecution amended the original murder charge and proceeded with the present one under s 304(a) of the Penal Code. It was the prosecution\u2019s case that when the accused pushed Wee out of the bedroom window, she intended to cause Wee\u2019s death.",
      "31": "The accused had no previous convictions or antecedents. The prosecution highlighted that there were 8 cases of domestic helpers charged with culpable homicide involving their employers or family members since 2002. 6 cases have been dealt with by the court. The present case was one of the 2 not dealt with yet.",
      "32": "The prosecution submitted that while it was not specifically urging the court to impose life imprisonment, that remained an option which the court should consider when deciding on the appropriate term of imprisonment for the facts at hand. The prosecution argued, on the authority of PP v Tan Fook Sum [1999] 2 SLR 523 that it did not have to apply for a deterrent sentence before the court could consider it in the exercise of its discretion. While the prosecution left the question of the appropriate length of imprisonment to the court, it contended that the sentence, if it was not life imprisonment, should not be less than 10 years in any event.",
      "33": "Harpreet Singh SC began the mitigation by reading a typewritten statement from the accused as follows:",
      "34": "The defence submitted that life imprisonment in this case would be manifestly excessive and unjust and noted that the prosecution was not specifically asking for that to be imposed. It reminded the court, citing V K Rajah J\u2019s judgment in PP v Chee Cheong Hin Constance [2006] 2 SLR 707 that the burden was on the prosecution to establish that the accused was likely to remain a future and real danger to the public without medication and permanent incarceration.",
      "35": "The accused\u2019s father is an odd-job labourer and her mother is a worker in rice fields. She is their youngest daughter. She grew up in a village in Central Java and undertook religious studies until the equivalent of our secondary 3 level. Her husband was from the same village. Their 10 year old son is living with her parents in Java. She has been a responsible mother and has shown great love and affection to her baby daughter born in prison. She came from a close-knit family and sent most of her salary home.",
      "36": "The months preceding the offence were very stressful ones for the accused. There was substantial stress in her relationship with her husband, in her finances and in her dealings with her employers. Her main concern was that her parents had her financial support back home. She was also deeply troubled by her husband\u2019s infidelity and that was aggravated when he told her that he had lost $1,000. Nevertheless, she missed him and harboured fears of being abandoned by him. In turn, she had to struggle with her own infidelity. She missed her son and also had to cope with the guilt of having to give up another son (from the earlier extra-marital relationship). She was a religious person who strived to live an upright life and who struggled constantly with her own shortcomings. She also had to struggle with the pressure of caring for Wee\u2019s husband, whose incontinence deprived her of sound sleep for the one month of her employment. It was these feelings of shame, depression, anger and fear that caused the accused to crack and commit the offence.",
      "37": "During the scuffle in the flat in the early hours of that morning, both women sustained injuries to their bodies. Wee fell backwards and hit her head against the wall. She then lost consciousness. That caused the accused to panic. After checking that Wee was still breathing, she left her on the bedroom floor and returned to the husband\u2019s bedroom to sleep, thinking that Wee would probably wake up and get back into bed. The scuffle did not result in Wee\u2019s death.",
      "38": "When Wee\u2019s husband awoke and wanted to urinate again, he asked the accused where Wee was. The accused then helped him to Wee\u2019s bedroom where she tried to revive Wee by slapping her cheeks and her legs. When Wee\u2019s husband told her to call the police for help by dialling \u201cthree nine\u201d, she left the bedroom. Wee\u2019s husband then wanted to leave the flat to seek help but was unable to find the house keys. The accused suggested that he call his son or go to his son\u2019s house. Wee\u2019s husband then sounded the emergency alarm and the two of them left the flat to seek help. When he reached the neighbour\u2019s flat, the accused returned to Wee\u2019s flat.",
      "39": "In a further report dated 11 July 2007, Dr Nagulendran opined that the onset of the accused\u2019s severe reactive depression was in 2004 when she broke off from her first extra-marital relationship with the Indonesian man while pregnant with his child. In May 2006, the accused gave birth to a girl as a result of her second extra-marital relationship. Her husband has agreed to be named as the father of the girl and has indicated that he will accept the accused and the girl. Due to the change in circumstances and the passage of time, the reactive factors had lessened in significance and that was reflected in her current state of mind which showed significant improvement. The accused would now have to deal with a new set of factors such as her sadness at Wee\u2019s death, her return to her family and to society and her rehabilitation as a wife and mother. She would require psychotherapy, counselling and supervision. The duration of the treatment would be two years. The defence psychiatrist also concluded that the incident was specific to a particular set of circumstances which were reactive in nature and not due to genetic, organic or personality defects and that it was unlikely that there would be a recurrence of such abnormality of mind as the causes of her mental disorder were transient and not of recurrent or lasting nature. The defence submitted therefore that the accused was not a threat to society. It further argued that as the particular set of circumstances which triggered the accused\u2019s reaction was no longer present and since she would return to be with her family upon her release, there was unlikely to be any risk of re-offending.",
      "40": "The defence submitted that evidence of premeditation was absent in this case and that the accused\u2019s actions were a direct result of her mental disorder that impaired her mental responsibility, thereby resulting in a totally irrational action. Both psychiatrists supported this conclusion. She acted impulsively. She had no history of violent behaviour. Given her mental condition, the night\u2019s events triggered by the threat of losing her job was the proverbial straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.",
      "41": "The cause of Wee\u2019s death was not the alleged strangulation. While the prosecution had argued that the accused had strangled Wee before the fall, the defence contended that the circumstances in which those injuries were inflicted were unknown. As there was no eye witness to the scuffle between the two women, the evidence concerning strangulation should be viewed with circumspection.",
      "42": "Once the accused had calmed down, she cooperated with the police and was forthcoming with her evidence, even during the long hours of interrogation in the fasting month. She handed over all material evidence.",
      "43": "The accused was remorseful and therefore decided to plead guilty. While in remand, she spent a considerable amount of time reflecting on the unfortunate incident, wondering how she could have lost control of herself and caused Wee\u2019s death.",
      "44": "The accused loved her family and her family loved and missed her. This was demonstrated by the many testimonials from her family members, including her husband and her ten year old son who would like to show his mother that he could now play football and wanted her to help him with his school work. She was generally of good character and was an inspiration and giver of support to her son and her nephew. She planned to return to her homeland to be with her family upon her release and would therefore not be exposed to the same kind of situation that she found herself in at the time of the offence.",
      "45": "The defence also submitted that any considerations of public interest to warrant a deterrent sentence must take into account V K Rajah J\u2019s dicta in Tan Kay Beng v PP [2006] 4 SLR 10 where the judge said (at [34]) that the precise reasons for invoking deterrence must be clearly and unambiguously articulated. Any public interest would not be undermined by not imposing a sentence of life imprisonment. General deterrence had a diminished role in cases involving mental impairment causally linked to the commission of the offence. Specific deterrence was not even required here since it was unlikely that the accused would re-offend. The accused\u2019s culpability was low as the events and her actions on the day in question were spontaneous. Far from being a devious murderer, she was merely a young female domestic worker with her own personal troubles, struggling to perform and to earn a living in a foreign land amidst stressful surroundings and who eventually crumbled under the pressures. Her mental condition was reactive, not chronic, and was at least moderately severe (see Dr Tommy Tan\u2019s opinion). There was no evidence to establish that she would be a future and real danger to the public without medication and permanent incarceration.",
      "46": "The accused made no attempt to mask the offence that she had committed. She also suggested to the husband to call his son or go to his son\u2019s house upon the husband noticing that Wee was lying unconscious on the floor. The accused did not pick up any weapon. She admitted her actions immediately during investigations by the CID. Life imprisonment for a young woman like her may mean that she would never be released despite the reviews provided for in the Prisons Regulations. Even ten years imprisonment would be too harsh in the circumstances. The defence suggested that a term of 5 to 7 years would not be inappropriate on the facts here.",
      "47": "Section 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Ed) provides:",
      "48": "The female accused is not liable to caning by virtue of s 231(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Ed).",
      "49": "In PP v Sundarti Supriyanto [2004] 4 SLR 622 (\u201cSundarti\u201d) (judgment on conviction) and [2004] SGHC 244 (judgment on sentence), a 21 year old female domestic helper was charged with murder of her female employer. The defence succeeded in showing grave and sudden provocation and she was therefore convicted on a lesser charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(a) of the Penal Code. The trial judge, M P H Rubin J, also found that there was cogent evidence to conclude that the deceased had subjected the accused to some measure of ill-treatment. The accused there inflicted multiple injuries on the victim including two stab wounds to her neck, one of which was fatal. After killing the victim, she left the scene to buy petrol and then returned to set the office premises on fire, with the victim inside. In sentencing the accused, Rubin J said (at [8] and [9] of the second citation):",
      "50": "Defence counsel in that case had also read out a message of apology by the accused to the deceased\u2019s family. The accused in that case was not mentally impaired but Rubin J (at [179] and [180] of the first citation) did find that she \u201chaving had enough, lost her self-control and went berserk in fatally attacking the deceased\u201d, that the nature of the injuries found on the deceased strongly suggested that they were \u201cthe acts of a person possessed of a frenzy and denuded of self-control\u201d, that \u201cthe cord of reason suddenly snapped when the accused could no longer control her emotions and feelings of despair\u201d and that she was \u201cnot an embodiment of wickedness and evil, but a woman of normal emotions who went awry momentarily\u201d.",
      "51": "In Purwanti Parji v PP [2005] 2 SLR 220 (\u201cPurwanti\u201d) , the Court of Appeal upheld the sentence of life imprisonment imposed by V K Rajah JC on a female domestic helper who had not turned 18 at the time of the offence. The accused there pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(a) of the Penal Code for strangling her female employer\u2019s 57 year old mother-in-law to death. The accused also admitted to trying to conceal her crime by making it look as if the deceased had committed suicide before calling the police and feigning concern for the deceased. The Court of Appeal said:",
      "52": "The Court of Appeal then proceeded to consider the aggravating factors in the case. The court affirmed that an act done after deliberation and with premeditation would aggravate the offence, as opposed to the situation where it is done on the spur of the moment and \u201cin hot blood\u201d. It found that the accused there had put in some thought and planning in her crime, agreeing with the trial judge that she had staged the scene to make it look as if the deceased had committed suicide (among other factors). The court also held that the law needed to protect certain groups of vulnerable and defenceless persons, such as the handicapped, incapacitated, children and the elderly and that anyone who committed an offence against such persons ought to be dealt with more severely. It noted that the deceased there was 57 years old and, if not by virtue of age, was also vulnerable and defenceless as the accused had caught her by surprise by sitting on her chest and strangling her while she was asleep.",
      "53": "The Court of Appeal also held that prevalence of an offence was a relevant aggravating factor. It went on to state (at [33]):",
      "54": "This was said by the Court of Appeal in February 2005. The present offence took place in October 2005. The Court of Appeal reiterated this approach when it said subsequently in its judgment (at [48]):",
      "55": "The Court of Appeal further stated (at [34]) that the court could depart from the general rule (that rehabilitation was the dominant consideration when dealing with young offenders of 21 years of age and below) when dealing with \u201catypical\u201d young offenders, for instance, those who were calculating in their offences. It held (at [38]) that the absence of antecedents was, like all other mitigating factors, something to be taken into account by the court and weighed against other factors, \u201cthe first and foremost of which, in the balancing process, is the public interest\u201d. The court added (at [37]) that although past sentencing cases were helpful, they were but mere guidelines and that each case must be looked at on its own unique facts and each offender in his own circumstances, noting that the case before the court involved violence in the \u201cunique context of an employer-domestic worker relationship\u201d and that cases involving violence in other various contexts were accordingly not very helpful.",
      "56": "In PP v Juminem and another [2005] 4 SLR 536, both accused persons were Indonesian domestic helpers aged 18 and 15 respectively at the time of the offence. The first accused worked for the female victim aged 47 while the second accused worked for the victim\u2019s former husband. Both the accused were tried on a joint charge of murder for smothering and strangling the victim to death after she had gone to sleep. The second accused had agreed to the first accused\u2019s suggestion that they kill her employer as the first accused was angry with her employer\u2019s ill treatment of her. There was premeditation and planning for about a week. At the conclusion of the trial, Choo Han Teck J held that both accused were entitled to rely on the exception of diminished responsibility and, accordingly, he convicted them on a lesser charge under s 304(a) of the Penal Code. The first accused suffered from a depressive disorder and from some physical abuse by her employer while the second accused was young, immature, of low intellect, possessed a sedate personality and suffered from depressive illness. They were sentenced to undergo life imprisonment and ten years imprisonment respectively.",
      "57": "In PP v Rohana [2006] SGHC 52, the accused, a 21 year old Indonesian domestic helper, pleaded guilty to having caused the death of her female employer aged 39 by strangling her. She admitted to having hit the victim\u2019s head with a large and heavy ornamental crystal object with such force that the object broke upon impact. When neighbours who had heard the commotion in the flat rang the door bell and shouted to the accused to open the door, she lied that she could not do so as her employer was still sleeping. She then tried to clean up the scene of crime. When the neighbours persisted, she lied repeatedly that her employer was out and would not allow her to open the door. Officers from the Singapore Civil Defence Force had to force the door open.",
      "58": "Counsel for the accused in that case stressed the simple background of the accused and the history of abuse she had suffered, including physical abuse such as slapping by the employer. The accused was suffering from an abnormality of mind resulting from her moderately severe depressive episode. Woo Bih Li J, in sentencing the accused to ten years imprisonment, said:",
      "59": "In PP v Aguilar Guen Garlejo [2006] 3 SLR 247 (\u201cAguilar\u201d), a 30 year old female domestic helper from the Philippines smothered and strangled to death her female friend in her employer\u2019s apartment and then dismembered the body, placing the body parts into a bag and a suitcase which she later left at two different locations in Singapore. The victim had visited the accused in her employer\u2019s apartment. A bitter argument broke out which escalated into a fight. The accused pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(a) of the Penal Code. The evidence before the court (at [37]) was that the accused there was labouring from masked depression or a single episode of moderate major depression. In a single episode, there was a clear and distinct start and end to the depression. Taking into consideration the case history and the background of the accused, the prosecution\u2019s consultant psychiatrist concluded that the accused had a low risk of recidivism. Before sentencing the accused to ten years imprisonment, V K Rajah J reasoned as follows (including an analysis of the cases discussed above):",
      "60": "Aguilar was not a case involving a domestic worker-employer relationship.",
      "61": "Applying the collective wisdom of the cases discussed above, I now explain why I felt compelled to sentence the accused here to life imprisonment. Wee, the victim, was not only an elderly woman of 75 years of age, she was unconscious and completely at the accused\u2019s mercy at the material time. The altercation and the fight between the two women were over. Wee had been decisively defeated and lay on the floor unable to move or even to shout for help. The accused had time to recover and reflect on the incident. I accepted that she did not plan before the altercation and fight to kill Wee that morning. However, as the courts have noted, intention can be formed on the spur of the moment. Throwing any person, let alone a completely helpless, unconscious elderly woman, down from the ninth storey to die on impact shows how cold-blooded and dangerous the killer must be, even after taking into account the diagnosis of depression, whether severe or moderately so. It was undisputed that the accused could still tell the difference between right and wrong when she committed the horrendous act. It must be emphasized that the act of pushing Wee to her death was not a continuum of the struggle, unlike the situation where one party pushes the other over a ledge or a balcony in the heat of a fight. The fight was over and the opponent as it were was knocked out.",
      "62": "Wee was effectively the accused\u2019s employer. The crime was perpetrated in the very place that Wee and her husband probably felt most secure in \u2013 home \u2013 by a person in whom a significant amount of trust is reposed. I repeat the words of the Court of Appeal in Purwanti (at [52]) above, that \u201cin upholding the employer-domestic worker relationship, deterrent sentences need to be meted out to violent domestic workers, as is the case for abusive employers\u201d. It was further not in dispute that the accused did not suffer any ill-treatment or abuse in the one month that she was working for Wee\u2019s family.",
      "63": "The accused\u2019s actions before and after the killing showed that she was actually quite collected in her thought process despite her depression. Initially, she tried to prevent Wee\u2019s husband from entering Wee\u2019s bedroom, claiming that Wee did not want to be disturbed. She then feigned concern for Wee by trying to revive her, after having abandoned her earlier. When Wee\u2019s husband decided to go to his neighbour for help, she went back into Wee\u2019s bedroom to dispose of the utterly defenceless woman, obviously knowing that the frail and sickly man would take some time to come back to the flat. After lifting and pushing Wee out of the bedroom window, the accused had the presence of mind to shut the window grilles. She was then able to repeatedly feign ignorance about Wee\u2019s whereabouts when questioned and could later lie to the neighbour, to Wee\u2019s family and even the police that perhaps she had gone for her morning exercise. In my opinion, what the accused has done shows her to be a dangerous person especially when her livelihood is at stake, even when she is in the wrong (like she was that fateful morning when she sneaked out of the flat to meet her paramour).",
      "64": "The medical diagnosis for the accused was that it was unlikely that there would be a \u201crecurrence of such abnormality of mind as the causes of her mental disorder were transient and not of recurrent or lasting nature\u201d (see Dr Nagulendran\u2019s second report) and that she needed treatment (psychotherapy, counselling and supervision) for two years. I note that Dr Nagulendran did not make any comment about Dr Tommy Tan\u2019s finding that the accused may have a dependent personality disorder. The accused\u2019s husband has been working abroad for the past several years and there is no indication that his family can afford to do away with his income from abroad. In all likelihood, he will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. If the accused is released after a few short years and returns home, she will still not have her husband \u201cto guide her in all things\u201d (see Dr Tommy Tan\u2019s second report). That would be so even if she were to work in the same country as her husband (which she did for a while in Malaysia but for some reason, she decided to return to Singapore to work). There is therefore little prospect of amelioration of her dependent personality disorder. She is likely to feel the need to be involved again with another man which will in turn make her feel guilty again and lead to or exacerbate her depression again.",
      "65": "The accused will be repatriated to her homeland after she has served her sentence here. She could undertake never to return here but, as the Court of Appeal in Purwanti noted, there was the likelihood that such accused persons might return under an assumed identity, especially when the weight of financial needs begins to be felt again. There is no evidence that her family\u2019s finances have got any better. The accused and her husband will have a young daughter to take care of in the coming years, in addition to their ten year old son. In all likelihood, her family\u2019s financial situation will become more difficult rather than improve and she might be compelled to seek employment here again. Even if she were to seek employment in other countries, we would be doing a disservice to her future employer elsewhere (and indeed, even in her own homeland) if she were to re-offend given her dependent personality disorder with its likely outcome. Of course, the exact scenario of that fateful morning in October 2005 may never replay itself but surely, there is nothing so unique about an argument between a domestic worker and her employer or another worker that it is unlikely to happen again. With the accused\u2019s personality disorder, her violent temperament (demonstrated during the quarrel and the fight when she was capable of strangling an elderly woman) and her unstable employment history, there is every likelihood that something will flare up again and that someone in future will get hurt badly, if not killed (and there are many more ways of killing besides pushing an unconscious elderly woman out of the window).",
      "66": "Life imprisonment in s 304(a) of the Penal Code is not reserved for only the incurable mentally impaired person or those who require long term treatment. The Hodgson conditions are merely guidelines and their status should not be overstated (see Purwanti at [50] above). The courts do not determine the length of imprisonment by simply correlating it with the period of treatment needed for the accused person. It has been repeated many times in other cases that all the individual circumstances of a case must be looked at. That is why even a teenaged female accused in Purwanti, not mentally impaired but of unstable character, could be sentenced to imprisonment for life. Despite the accused\u2019s plea of guilt and the very able mitigation plea put up by her senior counsel and his team, I was of the view that life imprisonment ought to be imposed in this case. The sentence was deemed to have commenced from the date of her arrest on 19 October 2005.",
      "67": "At the request of defence counsel, the accused\u2019s family and members of the Indonesian Embassy were permitted to speak to the accused in court for 15 minutes after the proceedings concluded."

      "1": "The precursor to this judgment is PP v Barokah [2008] SGHC 22 (\u201cmy previous judgment\u201d) which contains the grounds of my decision for sentencing Ms Barokah to life imprisonment on 26 November 2007 upon her plea of guilt to a charge under s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe first hearing before me\u201d).",
      "2": "Ms Barokah appealed to the Court of Appeal against my previous judgment. At the first hearing before the Court of Appeal on 22 April 2008, her counsel (the same counsel at the first hearing before me and at the present hearing) applied to the Court of Appeal to admit a further psychiatric report dated 6 March 2008 from Dr Nagulendran, the defence psychiatrist. After hearing arguments, the Court of Appeal rejected the application.",
      "3": "The Court of Appeal then proceeded to hear the appeal on its merits. In the course of his submissions, defence counsel argued that Ms Barokah\u2019s actions were the impulsive reaction of a newly pregnant woman at the time of the offence on 19 October 2005. Some issue apparently arose as to whether the defence psychiatrist was aware of Ms Barokah\u2019s pregnancy. Defence counsel, after checking with Dr Nagulendran over the telephone, informed the court that the defence psychiatrist did not know that Ms Barokah was pregnant at the time of the offence when he put up his first two reports. (It can be seen from Dr Nagulendran\u2019s report of 11 July 2007 (Appellant\u2019s Bundle of Statements and Documents at page 24), that he had in fact noted that Ms Barokah \u201cgave birth to a girl in May 2006\u201d, some seven months after the offence. The date of birth of the girl is erroneous as it should be 3 July 2006. That report had been tendered at the first hearing before me.)",
      "4": "Defence counsel then applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to adduce a further report in order that the defence psychiatrist could comment on the impact of pregnancy on Ms Barokah\u2019s mental state at the time of the offence. The Court of Appeal decided to adjourn the hearing so that the psychiatrists for the prosecution and for the defence could consider whether the issue of pregnancy would affect their findings contained in their earlier reports submitted at the first hearing before me.",
      "5": "At the second hearing before the Court of Appeal on 20 August 2008, two further reports dated 12 June 2008 and 24 July 2008 (supplemented by an addendum dated 25 July 2008) by Dr Nagulendran and a further report dated 9 July 2008 by the prosecution\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr Tommy Tan, were produced before the Court of Appeal. After hearing submissions, the Court of Appeal made the following orders (as indicated in the Certificate of Result of Appeal):",
      "6": "This is how this case is now before me a second time. After a number of pre-hearing conferences with counsel for both parties, the lists of witnesses to be called by both parties were settled. At the final pre-hearing conference on 5 February 2009, I indicated to counsel for both parties that my understanding of the Court of Appeal\u2019s directions set out in [5] above was that the Court of Appeal neither directed nor allowed Ms Barokah to testify at the second hearing before me and that if they thought otherwise, they should seek the Court of Appeal\u2019s clarification immediately. Counsel for both parties agreed that this was the correct reading of the Court of Appeal\u2019s directions.",
      "7": "As the conviction of Ms Barokah was not set aside, the facts set out in my previous judgment relating to her conviction still stand and are relevant for the purpose of this second hearing. Further, as my previous judgment dealt with the earlier psychiatric reports and expressed my views on why life imprisonment should be imposed (which I will be referring to in this judgment), I think it is appropriate to attach my previous judgment as an annexure [Annexure included*] for easy reference. This judgment should therefore be read in conjunction with my previous judgment which I adopt unless otherwise stated.",
      "8": "At the second hearing before me held between 16 and 19 February 2009 (with submissions by the parties on 23 February 2009), the prosecution called the following seven witnesses:",
      "9": "The defence called the following three witnesses:",
      "10": "It was agreed that the psychiatrists (i.e. Dr Tommy Tan and Dr Nagulendran) would sit in during the testimony of all other witnesses and that they would take the witness stand last.",
      "11": "SGT Nor Hida and SSGT Mohamad Kamil were the first police officers to arrive at the scene of death at Block 19 Chai Chee Road (\u201cBlock 19\u201d) on 19 October 2005. While both of them were on mobile patrol that morning, they were instructed to proceed to Block 19 to look into information from a resident that a body was lying motionless on the ground there. They arrived at about 7.21 am. At about 7.28 am, other police officers arrived at the scene to help cordon off the area. An ambulance arrived and the paramedic pronounced the body lying there, i.e. Wee Keng Wah (\u201cWee\u201d), the deceased mentioned in the charge, to be dead. A short while later, Lee Seng Lim (Wee\u2019s son) approached the police officers and requested to look at the body as he suspected that it was his mother. After confirming that it was his mother, Lee Seng Lim brought SGT Nor Hida and SSGT Mohamad Kamil up to Wee\u2019s flat (i.e. #09-328) on the 9th level of Block 19.",
      "12": "The two police officers checked all the windows of the flat. They noticed that the aluminium window grilles in Wee\u2019s bedroom were closed and the left casement window was opened. SSGT Mohamad Kamil then interviewed Ms Barokah in simple English and Malay with SGT Nor Hida standing nearby. Ms Barokah understood his questions and told him that she had been working there for about one month, that she slept in the bedroom of Wee\u2019s husband and that Wee slept in the other bedroom. Ms Barokah also said that at about 4.30 am that day, she woke up to accompany Wee\u2019s husband to the toilet. Just before going into the toilet, she went into Wee\u2019s bedroom to inform her. When she entered Wee\u2019s bedroom, she saw Wee lying on the floor next to her bed, facing upwards. Suspecting that Wee could have fallen from her bed, she tried to wake her up but Wee merely groaned. She then moved Wee to a sitting position with her back leaning against the wall. She told the police officer that Wee was not bleeding and that she had gone immediately to seek help from Wee\u2019s husband.",
      "13": "Ms Barokah also informed the police officers that she wanted to call the police but did not know what number to dial. She approached Wee\u2019s husband who showed her first three fingers followed by nine fingers but she did not understand what this meant. Wee\u2019s husband then returned to his bedroom, held an alarm device and activated it. Wee\u2019s husband also asked Ms Barokah to call his son and his daughter. She tried calling them but there was no response. She then decided to seek help from the neighbours but did not know where Wee kept the keys.",
      "14": "Ms Barokah went on to inform the police officers that at about 5.10 am, Wee\u2019s husband and Ms Barokah entered Wee\u2019s bedroom to search for the flat\u2019s keys. At that point in time, Wee was still in the same position, sitting down and leaning against the wall. Wee was breathing heavily then. They found the keys and left the flat to seek help from a neighbour two doors away.",
      "15": "The police officers then proceeded to interview Richard Chew, the neighbour. Richard Chew told them that the alarm device held by Wee\u2019s husband was still sounding when the elderly man reached Richard Chew\u2019s flat alone. Richard Chew managed to turn it off only when both of them returned to Wee\u2019s flat. However, Richard Chew could not find Wee in the flat. Ms Barokah was then in the living room. He then decided to call Wee\u2019s son, Lee Seng Lim. SGT Nor Hida\u2019s evidence on this point was that Richard Chew told them Ms Barokah requested him to call Lee Seng Lim and he did so.",
      "16": "Having heard this account from Richard Chew, the police officers questioned Ms Barokah further. She informed them that half way to Richard Chew\u2019s flat, she left Wee\u2019s husband and returned to the flat in order to call Lee Seng Lim. However, no one responded. Ms Barokah added that when she was helping Wee into a sitting position, she opened the left casement window and the window grilles. Subsequently, she closed the window grilles but did not lock them. At the request of the police officers, she demonstrated to them the sequence of her opening and then closing the casement window and the window grilles. When the police officers asked Ms Barokah about the damaged red plastic rack, she replied that when she discovered Wee lying on the floor, the said rack was already broken and its items were strewn on the floor of the bedroom.",
      "17": "Throughout their conversation with Ms Barokah, she appeared normal and calm to the police officers. She did not appear to them to be anxious, distressed, frightened, angry or aggressive. She looked neat. She understood the questions and responded spontaneously. The police officers had no difficulty understanding her. They left the scene after other police officers arrived.",
      "18": "Under cross-examination, they agreed that their impression of Ms Barokah\u2019s behaviour was based on memory as there was nothing in their log sheets (recorded after the incident) concerning her demeanour. However, if they had noticed anything abnormal about her, they would have recorded it. SGT Nor Hida agreed that when they informed Ms Barokah that Wee was dead, she appeared shocked and sad. She could not recall whether she cried too. She disagreed that Ms Barokah went to the kitchen and took some time to compose herself. Ms Barokah did not ask them how Wee died.",
      "19": "Richard Chew, a hair stylist, lived two doors away from Wee and her husband. He has known Lee Seng Lim for more than 30 years as Lee Seng Lim used to live with his parents in Wee\u2019s flat before his marriage. At about 5.30 am on 19 October 2005, Richard Chew was sleeping in his bedroom when he heard a loud alarm sounding outside his flat and someone calling his name. He went out and found Wee\u2019s husband (whom he addressed as \u201cUncle\u201d) holding the alarm in his hand. He asked Wee\u2019s husband what happened, where his wife was and why she had not switched off the alarm for him but he did not respond. Instead Wee\u2019s husband started walking gingerly back to his flat. Richard Chew followed, intending to help him turn off the alarm.",
      "20": "When the two men reached Wee\u2019s flat, Richard Chew shouted for \u201cAuntie\u201d (i.e. Wee) asking her why she had not turned off the alarm for her husband. There was no answer. He then asked Wee\u2019s husband where Wee was and was told that she was lying in the bedroom. Richard Chew went to the doorway of Wee\u2019s bedroom and turned on the room lights. No one was inside. The bedroom was in a mess. He asked Wee\u2019s husband again where his wife was and was told again that she was lying on the floor. Richard Chew managed to turn off the alarm for Wee\u2019s husband.",
      "21": "Seeing Ms Barokah in the living room, Richard Chew asked her in Malay, \u201cMana Por Por\u201d (\u201cWhere is Por Por?\u201d). She said she did not know. He then asked her whether she had called \u201cYoung Sir\u201d (i.e. Lee Seng Lim) and she said yes. Sensing something was amiss about Wee\u2019s bedroom, he asked her for Lee Seng Lim\u2019s contact number. She handed him a piece of paper with some numbers written on it. She appeared normal, steady and neat. She did not appear frightened, distressed or disturbed. She was spontaneous in her replies. He then called Lee Seng Lim, who was living a few blocks away from his parents, and asked him to go over to Wee\u2019s flat. He then left the flat with Wee\u2019s husband and they stood in the corridor to wait for Lee Seng Lim to arrive. Ms Barokah remained in the flat. Richard Chew did not pay attention to what she was doing inside.",
      "22": "When Lee Seng Lim arrived with one of his sons, Richard Chew narrated the events to him. Lee Seng Lim then went into the flat to look around and emerged a while later to tell his father that Wee could have left for her regular morning exercise. After that, Richard Chew went back home to sleep.",
      "23": "Sometime later, he was awakened by some noise from the ground floor. As he went out of his flat, he saw a lot of police officers outside Wee\u2019s flat. He approached Lee Seng Lim and was told that someone had found a body at the foot of Block 19. They went down to check. Lee Seng Lim\u2019s elder brother was also at the ground floor. One of the brothers went to look at the body and said it was Wee. Richard Chew was shocked. He then returned home. Later that morning, he discussed with Lee Seng Lim the funeral arrangements for Wee.",
      "24": "Richard Chew agreed that he was a good family friend of Lee Seng Lim and was upset by the news of Wee\u2019s demise. However, he disagreed that his evidence about Ms Barokah was coloured by this relationship. He also disagreed that it was Ms Barokah\u2019s idea to call Lee Seng Lim that morning, that she dialled the number and passed the telephone to him or that she said she wanted to speak to Lee Seng Lim during the call and then said something to Lee Seng Lim in a confused state before passing the telephone back to Richard Chew. He did not remember being interviewed by the police officers. He had no interaction with Ms Barokah before 19 October 2005 although he knew that she was the new domestic helper. He disagreed that he spoke to her about Wee\u2019s husband\u2019s alarm that morning or that she helped him find the gadget to turn it off. He also denied that she asked him to go with her to Lee Seng Lim\u2019s flat as she did not know its number. Defence counsel also put to Richard Chew that he asked Ms Barokah why Lee Seng Lim was taking so long to arrive at Wee\u2019s flat, commenting to her that if he had taken the car, it should not take more than 10 minutes and that she said, \u201cMaybe Sir is walking\u201d. Richard Chew denied that he had this conversation with her while he was waiting in the corridor with Wee\u2019s husband. He also disagreed that she asked Wee\u2019s husband to go inside the flat but he refused to do so.",
      "25": "Lee Seng Lim and his family (wife and two sons) were preparing for a trip to Malaysia at about 5.30 am on 19 October 2005 when he received a telephone call from Richard Chew and was told that his mother was missing from the flat and that his father had requested Richard Chew to call the police. Lee Seng Lim, who lives in Block 27 Chai Chee Road, several blocks away from his parents\u2019 flat in Block 19, then walked over to Block 19 with his elder son. When they met Richard Chew and Wee\u2019s husband in the corridor outside Wee\u2019s flat, the two men told him about the events of the morning. After reassuring his father that perhaps Wee had gone for her morning exercise which she normally did around that time, Lee Seng Lim went into Wee\u2019s flat.",
      "26": "He saw Ms Barokah and asked her in English, \u201cWhere is Mum?\u201d. She said she did not know. He looked around the flat and noted that Wee\u2019s bedroom was uncharacteristically untidy. He then turned to Ms Barokah who was following him around and asked her the same question again. She gave the same reply that she did not know. When asked why the bedroom was so messy, she replied that Wee had fallen down. He then asked, \u201cMum fall down, then where is Mum now?\u201d. Again she said she did not know. He walked around Wee\u2019s bedroom, opened the window grilles towards the right and looked outside but saw nothing. He then shut the window grilles, asked her again where Wee was and got the same reply. He then walked to the kitchen and went out of the flat to tell his father not to worry as Wee could have gone for her usual morning exercise. Lee Seng Lim asked Ms Barokah again, \u201cWhere is Mum?\u201d. This time she said she did not know and maybe Wee had gone for her exercise. He then asked her why she said earlier that Wee had fallen down and was now saying that she could have gone for exercise. She said she did not know.",
      "27": "After that, Lee Seng Lim asked his son to go look for Wee at Block 60, the location Wee used to go to for her morning exercise. He also called Changi General Hospital to check whether Wee had been sent there since Ms Barokah said Wee had a fall. He then called to inform his elder sister and his elder brother and requested them to go to Wee\u2019s flat as it was about time for him and his family to leave for their trip. His elder brother was ill. His elder sister told him her husband would be going over to Lee Seng Lim\u2019s flat to pick up his wife and his younger son and then meet him at Wee\u2019s flat later. They had made prior arrangements for the brother-in-law to drive the family to Golden Mile Complex to board a coach for Malaysia.",
      "28": "The elder son returned to say that he could not locate Wee at Block 60. Lee Seng Lim and his family then left in the brother-in-law\u2019s car for Golden Mile Complex. On the way there, Lee Seng Lim felt uneasy and told his family that they should cancel the trip. They then returned to Chai Chee Road and searched the vicinity for Wee before returning to Block 19 at sometime past 7 am. By that time, the police was already there. He walked to the rear of the block and saw a white cloth covering a body on the floor. He requested to look at the body as he believed that it could be his mother. He was allowed to do so. He did not see Wee\u2019s face but managed to identify her from the clothing, her build and the fact that she was lying directly below her bedroom window.",
      "29": "He then went up to Wee\u2019s flat and saw more police officers standing outside. He went into the flat and asked Ms Barokah again what had happened. Again she said she did not know. Lee Seng Lim then told her, \u201cMum is die downstairs already, you better tell me what happened\u201d. He got the same reply from her. The police then led him aside and did not allow him to talk further with her. He went to be with his father.",
      "30": "According to Lee Seng Lim, the relationship between his parents and Ms Barokah was fine. There was no complaint from Wee\u2019s husband. However, Wee had complained about one week after Ms Barokah started working for his parents about an incident one night at around 11 pm when Ms Barokah told her that she had dropped a towel from the kitchen window and then left the flat to look for it. As she failed to return home soon thereafter, Wee went to the ground floor to look for her and found her talking to a man there. Wee shouted at her and she approached Wee. They then searched for the towel but could not locate it. At around midnight, Wee heard some noise coming from her husband\u2019s bedroom which had a window looking into the corridor. She went to check and saw a shadow moving past along the corridor. Ms Barokah, who was then standing at the window, denied talking to anyone.",
      "31": "The next day following Wee\u2019s complaint, Lee Seng Lim spoke to Ms Barokah about the incident. She claimed that she did not know the man at the ground floor who approached her and asked her if she was living there. She denied talking to anyone standing outside the window of Wee\u2019s husband\u2019s bedroom. He also told the maid agency about the incident and asked for advice. He was informed that he could terminate her employment but would have to wait sometime before a replacement domestic helper could be found. He then decided to give Ms Barokah another chance.",
      "32": "Lee Seng Lim visited his parents about five days every week. He would have his dinner at his parents\u2019 home. Ms Barokah, who would eat with them at the dining table, did not tell him that she was unhappy. She was always smiling and exhibited no unusual behaviour. She was the first domestic helper employed by his family for the purpose of looking after his sickly father.",
      "33": "Lee Seng Lim denied that he had noticed during his visits to Wee\u2019s flat that Ms Barokah hardly ate and asked her for the reasons. (This was what Ms Barokah told Dr Helen Chen, one of the defence expert witnesses called at this second hearing \u2013 see [48] below). He also denied that Ms Barokah always appeared tired. He did not think Wee, a good tempered person, could have lost her cool and scolded Ms Barokah, as suggested by defence counsel. He denied that Ms Barokah spoke to him over the telephone in the morning of 19 October 2005. It was Richard Chew who called him.",
      "34": "Lee Seng Lim\u2019s wife, Lim Yock Hoon, went over to Wee\u2019s flat at about 6.15 am on 19 October 2005. She asked Ms Barokah in the flat where Wee was and she replied that she did not know. When Lim Yock Hoon saw the untidy bedroom and asked why the plastic rack was left toppled on the floor, Ms Barokah said that Wee had fallen down. Asked whether it was serious, she replied that Wee was groaning. She was then asked again where Wee was and she said Wee had gone for her exercise. Throughout the conversation, Ms Barokah appeared normal and calm. Since Wee managed to go for her regular exercise, Lim Yock Hoon thought she could not have been seriously injured. The rest of her evidence was largely the same as her husband\u2019s. She confirmed that the relationship between Wee and Ms Barokah was quite good. She visited Wee\u2019s flat at least five times a week with her husband and had never heard Ms Barokah, who dined at the same table as Wee, complaining about unhappiness.",
      "35": "Dr Tan Heng Hao, an associate consultant attached to the Department of Reproductive Medicine, KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital, testified that he examined Ms Barokah on 11 April 2006. She had given birth twice before. She was unsure of her dates of menstruation and her periods were irregular. At that time, her baby was found to be about 28 weeks gestation. A subsequent screening scan done two weeks later confirmed this. In view of the above facts, it was difficult to say when she would know that she was pregnant. The possible date of conception could be in early October 2006, plus or minus two to three weeks. At the time of the offence on 19 October 2005, she may or may not be aware of her pregnancy. She was also seen at the same hospital on six other occasions (by other doctors) between 25 April 2006 and 29 June 2006 and was admitted for delivery on 3 July 2006 when she gave birth to a full-term baby girl. She was discharged the next day.",
      "36": "Based on her medical records, there was nothing to show that Ms Barokah was suffering from depression during her pregnancy. If she had any such symptoms, she would have been referred to a psychiatrist. During the first six weeks of pregnancy, the symptoms may be of the pre-menstrual type. After six weeks, nausea and vomiting could occur together with non-specific symptoms like bloatedness, fatigue and dizziness.",
      "37": "The final witness for the prosecution was Dr Tommy Tan. He was at the material time a consultant psychiatrist in the Institute of Mental Health but now has his own private practice. As agreed, he took the stand only after all the other witnesses for the prosecution and the defence (except Dr Nagulendran) had testified. In my previous judgment, I dealt with Dr Tommy Tan\u2019s reports of 30 November 2005 and 5 April 2007. In his latest report of 9 July 2008, in which he responded to Dr Nagulendran\u2019s report of 12 June 2008, Dr Tommy Tan again disagreed with Dr Nagulendran\u2019s assessment that Ms Barokah had a severe depressive episode. He cited the diagnostic criteria in the World Health Organization\u2019s International Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders, 10th edition (\u201cICD-10\u201d) and the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (\u201cDSM-4\u201d) to refute Dr Nagulendran\u2019s assessment as Ms Barokah did not exhibit signs of considerable distress, agitation or mental or physical retardation. When the depressive episode is severe, the symptoms thereof are easily observable by any person. He maintained his opinion that Ms Barokah had a moderate depressive episode, which he explained is also quite bad. I do not need to dwell on this further as defence counsel conceded, after cross-examination of Dr Tommy Tan and when Dr Nagulendran took the witness stand, that Dr Tommy Tan\u2019s assessment that the depressive episode was moderate was correct.",
      "38": "On the issue of pregnancy, Dr Tommy Tan opined that since it was probable that Ms Barokah did not know that she was pregnant, that could not have been a stressor causing her depression. During his four interviews with her in November 2005, each lasting for more than an hour, there was nothing said by Ms Barokah that would lead him to believe that she was pregnant then. None of the experienced nurses in Changi Women\u2019s Prison noted any signs of pregnancy. As Ms Barokah carried her baby girl to full term and delivered on 3 July 2006, conception would have taken place sometime in end September or early October 2005. The offence was committed on 19 October 2005. The medical literature on this issue does not mention ante-natal hormonal changes that are linked to depression.",
      "39": "Dr Tommy Tan explained that his diagnosis of a moderate depressive episode was made wholly on the entries in Ms Barokah\u2019s diary as she had not been forthcoming in the sessions with her. He could not ignore the entries which expressed abandonment by her husband and her wish to have her husband guide her so that she would not go wrong in things that mattered. He was not convinced that the stress of work, mistreatment by her employer or her pregnancy were causes of her depressive disorder. Ms Barokah had worked in Singapore before and therefore separation from her family might not be a substantive cause too.",
      "40": "Dr Tommy Tan emphasized that his earlier report stated that Ms Barokah \u201cmay\u201d have a dependent personality disorder (\u201cDPD\u201d), not that he had diagnosed her to have such a disorder. Making such a diagnosis was extremely difficult as it required examination of the patient over a longer period of time and in different situations and it also needed collaboration with family members and others. He opined that she could satisfy some of the criteria for borderline personality disorder, such as wanting her husband to guide her in her decisions, fear of abandonment and getting into relationships with other men. Under cross-examination, he added the fact that she went to excessive lengths to meet her boyfriend, as indicated by Wee\u2019s complaint to her son and daughter-in-law (see [28] and [29] above), also pointed towards possible DPD. While he could not make a positive diagnosis of DPD, to say that Ms Barokah did not have DPD would do her a disservice because DPD would figure very much in her treatment. While the diary entries could reflect depressive thoughts, getting into relationships with other men when her husband was not around was not a sign of depression. He agreed that she could have been merely lonely too. If the statements made by Ms Barokah\u2019s family members tendered during the mitigation plea at the first hearing before me are accurate, they would point away from DPD. In the absence of other apparent stressors, he had to explore the possibility of DPD which might predispose her to developing a depressive episode. He maintained that she may have DPD.",
      "41": "Committing homicide was not within the realm of usual experience and therefore Ms Barokah would be remorseful over what had happened. She will need long term psychiatric follow-up, i.e. for life. He disagreed with Dr Nagulendran\u2019s assessment that she could be treated within two years. No one could say with any certainty that she will not get involved with other men in the future and then experience the same guilt feelings. After all, there was already a recent history of two men within two years. Psychotherapy for a person who has committed homicide may require many years to help that person overcome the trauma of killing another and treatment for a person with a personality disorder will be even more challenging. Dr Tommy Tan, quoting the defence expert, Dr Helen Chen, whom he lauded as the best in her field of specialty, said that \u201cNothing is certain in psychiatry\u201d.",
      "42": "Dr Tommy Tan agreed that fatigue from sleep deprivation - the defence said Ms Barokah had to wake up 5 to 8 times a night because of Wee\u2019s husband\u2019s incontinence - could keep a person with moderate depressive episode depressed or worsen the depression. He disagreed with Dr Nagulendran\u2019s view that it is unlikely that there will be a recurrence of depressive episode as the causes of her mental disorder were transient and not of recurrent or lasting nature. While the particular set of circumstances at the material time was unique, there will be other events in the future which could cause Ms Barokah to be depressed again. Citing DSM-4, he noted that a person with a major depressive episode has a 60% risk of relapse. If the depressive episode was severe, the risk would be even more. Given the history of homicide in this case, Dr Tommy Tan would be very worried whether homicide will recur or whether there will be self-harm in future.",
      "43": "Dr Tommy Tan agreed that there are also favourable prognostic factors such as the fact that females are generally less prone to violence, that there was no prior history of violence and that good family support may lower the risk of recidivism. He also agreed that the fact that Ms Barokah was seen taking good care of her newborn baby in prison is a factor in her favour. As for her good behaviour in custody, he noted that prison is an artificial environment. As for remorse, he noted that there was no sign of that in Ms Barokah in the immediate aftermath of the offence and that, in his view, is a very negative factor. Another unfavourable factor is the fact that she tried to hide the truth from Wee\u2019s family and the police. He agreed that she could be very frightened then too. He would assess her risk of re-offending as somewhere between low and moderate.",
      "44": "Mr Isnaini, 31 years of age, is Ms Barokah\u2019s husband. At the first hearing before me, his handwritten note setting out his love for her and his desire for her prompt return was tendered in mitigation. His hometown is in Central Java, Indonesia. He has been working as a factory worker in a furniture factory in Muar, Malaysia, for the past seven years. He married his wife in 1998. As the couple worked in different countries, they communicated with each other over the telephone.",
      "45": "When Ms Barokah was working in Singapore, she would call him using her mobile phone. After she started working for Wee and her husband, she informed him in one of her calls that her mobile phone had been confiscated by the maid agency. Although surprised that she was able to contact him nonetheless, he did not question her about it.",
      "46": "On or about 17 October 2005, two days before the offence, they spoke over the telephone. He asked her how she had obtained a mobile phone to call him. She told him that she was using another mobile phone and, after repeated questioning by him about the source of that mobile phone, reluctantly replied that it was given to her by her boyfriend in Singapore. He was shattered upon hearing this and scolded her. She began to cry. He questioned her angrily and persistently about her relationship with the boyfriend and she denied having had sex with him. He then ended the call by warning her angrily that if she had had sex with the boyfriend, something bad would befall her. That was the last phone call they had before the offence on 19 October 2005.",
      "47": "On 21 October 2005, Mr Isnaini was informed by the Indonesian Embassy that his wife was in custody. He was shocked and concerned and has been following the court proceedings since then. He also attended the hearing when his wife was sentenced. In spite of all that has happened, he still loves her and wants her as his wife. When she is released from prison, he intends to end his contract in Malaysia (which ends in March 2009) and return home to Indonesia with her. He is sure he will be able to find a job there as a chauffeur or driver. He did not work as such for the last seven years because the pay for such jobs was very low. Nevertheless, he will try his best to manage and earn a living for his family. He has also accepted the baby girl born on 3 July 2006 as his own child and is happy to have a daughter. He brought the baby girl to Ms Barokah\u2019s grandparents in Indonesia. He has forgiven his wife for her past mistakes.",
      "48": "Under cross-examination, Mr Isnaini denied that he had a girlfriend or that he had had sex with her. He agreed that he first visited Ms Barokah on 10 May 2006, more than six months after the date of the offence. That was because he was not permitted to come to Singapore earlier as the investigations were not completed then. He made various visits subsequently. Although there was a 10-month interval between the visits in November 2006 and in September 2007, that was due to his work in Malaysia. He needed his employer\u2019s permission to come to Singapore. He is no longer angry with his wife. He did not accept the son that his wife had as a result of her affair in Indonesia but accepts the baby girl because of her gender and because his wife had already spoken to their neighbour to take care of the son.",
      "49": "Dr Helen Chen is a senior consultant psychiatrist at the KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital. She is the head of the Mental Wellness Service there. Her expertise is as a psychiatrist with special interest in women\u2019s mental health and perinatal psychiatry. She prepared a report dated 21 August 2008 at the request of the police but was not called as an expert witness. At the request of defence counsel, she prepared another report dated 15 January 2009 after having interviewed Ms Barokah in prison on 16 December 2008 and on 8 January 2009.",
      "50": "Her first report was a general one relating to the state of a woman in her early weeks of pregnancy and for whom the pregnancy was most likely unplanned. Her second report contains a cautionary note about the accuracy of information from Ms Barokah as her contact with Ms Barokah was made after more than three years after the offence. Further, as Ms Barokah had had extensive interviews with Dr Tommy Tan and Dr Nagulendran and with the police, these could influence her memory, understanding and account of the events. Dr Helen Chen also emphasized that her expertise is not as an obstetric specialist. In this second report, she recorded that Ms Barokah claimed to have had low mood after she started her last employment, troubled as she was by thoughts about her relationships and missing her home and children. She was exhausted as she had to rise up to five times a night to help Wee\u2019s husband go to the toilet but did not experience nausea or vomiting. However, she could not eat. That was noticed by Wee\u2019s son (Lee Seng Lim) who asked her why she hardly ate but she did not say much to him (see also [31] above). She had no idea that she was pregnant until two months after her arrest when she missed her menses. However, she was worried about being pregnant in the weeks before 19 October 2005 after having sex with her boyfriend four or five days after starting work in Wee\u2019s flat on (20 September 2005).",
      "51": "On 19 October 2005, Ms Barokah went to meet her boyfriend to initiate a break-up as she felt remorseful about her wrongdoing towards her husband. She was also troubled that her husband was having an affair as well. She was not able to clarify if the worries about being pregnant had been troubling her in the hours leading to her confrontation with Wee. Dr Helen Chen said that the commonly experienced symptoms of early pregnancy include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite and emotional lability. She was of the view that her pregnancy possibly contributed to Ms Barokah\u2019s fatigue in the two to three weeks prior to and at the time of the offence. However, her fatigue could also be a symptom of her depression or due to lack of sleep from her night-time activities and duties. She could not ascertain the influence of each factor on her mental state or quantify the severity of the fatigue. There is no available literature on fatigue in early pregnancy. Given her troubled mental state and her account that she returned to Wee\u2019s flat at 2 am on 19 October 2005 and was awake with Wee and her husband until the time of the offence, she could have been extremely exhausted as the sense of fatigue experienced in early pregnancy could be intensive for some women. For women with unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, the likelihood of antenatal depression is even higher.",
      "52": "Dr Helen Chen emphasized that she is not a forensic trained psychiatrist and Ms Barokah being the first woman she was seeing who was alleged to have committed homicide, she refrained from giving any opinion on the likelihood of Ms Barokah re-offending. She noted, however, that Ms Barokah cared for and nursed her baby girl for about 20 months in prison. She concluded by stating:",
      "53": "Dr Helen Chen explained, under cross-examination, that 9 out of 10 pregnant women do not suffer depression. Asked to comment on paragraph 29 of the Statement of Facts tendered at the first hearing before me (describing how Ms Barokah returned to Wee\u2019s flat and carried Wee onto the bed before pushing her out of the window), she commented that the acts there did not seem to be those of an extremely exhausted woman. Ms Barokah had told her that she had to struggle to move Wee. Shown photographs of Ms Barokah taken on 19 October 2005, Dr Helen Chen agreed that they did not show a malnourished woman. Ms Barokah bonded well with her baby girl and has not hurt her unlike others who have their freedom who may abandon their children.",
      "54": "In his oral testimony, Dr Nagulendran conceded that Ms Barokah\u2019s major depressive episode could be classified as moderate (as against his own assessment that it was severe). His assessment of her mental state was \u201cat the time of the alleged offence\u201d, not the weeks or months preceding that. If the offence had not taken place, a continuation of her severe reactive depression would eventually lead to her disability to continue with social, work or domestic activities. After reading Dr Tommy Tan\u2019s second report of 5 April 2007 where possible DPD was diagnosed, Dr Nagulendran conducted another three interviews with Ms Barokah. He did not ask her any questions relating to DPD as he had no doubts in his mind that she did not have DPD. In his report of 6 March 2008 (which the Court of Appeal initially rejected at the application to admit further evidence but which I now consider as part of the evidence I have to take into account in view of the developments highlighted in [1] to [5] above), Dr Nagulendran opined, in disagreeing with the last six lines of [61] of my previous judgment, that Ms Barokah did not have DPD as she did not satisfy the diagnostic criteria for this set out in DSM-4. He also stated that she did not have a violent temperament as there was no past evidence of violent behaviour and that she did not have a history of violence in her previous employments. There was no evidence of her instability. There is no reason for Dr Nagulendran to believe that she will re-offend as \u201cthe incident was specific to a particular set of circumstances which were reactive in nature and not due to genetic, organic or personality defects\u201d. The causes of her mental disorder were transient and not of recurrent or lasting nature. She also has strong family support as evidenced by the testimonials tendered during the mitigation plea.",
      "55": "In his report of 12 June 2008, Dr Nagulendran provided the reasons for his assessment of severe depressive episode (which is now irrelevant in the light of his concession at [52] above). On pregnancy, he cited from literature and opined that the fact that Ms Barokah was one month pregnant and already suffering from depression with the associated hormonal changes would have contributed to the severity of her illness. On the issue of DPD, he stood by his earlier assessment and explained that DPD is a life long condition and is not due to a single episode of a transient nature. Treatment for DPD is in the form of psychotherapy for a reasonable period depending on the patient\u2019s ability to understand her condition and her motivation to improve. Even if Ms Barokah has DPD, she is unlikely to re-offend for the reasons listed in his report of 6 March 2008. Although there are some differences between the agreed Statement of Facts and the information provided through Ms Barokah, he stands by his conclusions and opinions. He was also of the opinion that the fact that he did not interview Ms Barokah in the immediate aftermath of the offence would not result in his assessment carrying less weight. He did not think it necessary to interview Wee\u2019s family members and/or other relevant persons because the information would not differ from that given to the prosecution.",
      "56": "In his report of 24 July 2008, Dr Nagulendran opined that as Ms Barokah was already experiencing symptoms of depression, the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy would have contributed to the worsening of her depression. The symptoms of morning sickness, anxiety and depression are generally suffered regardless of the woman\u2019s awareness or knowledge of her pregnancy. He reiterated his opinion that Ms Barokah was not suffering from DPD or a borderline personality disorder (referred to by Dr Tommy Tan) as there were no features to indicate the presence of these conditions. He quoted the following conclusions from his earlier report of 11 July 2007:",
      "57": "Because of the positive prognostic factors in Ms Barokah\u2019s favour, Dr Nagulendran was of the view that she would fall within the 40% of people who would not suffer a second major depressive episode rather than the 60% who would. He felt that she was not hiding facts from the police as she told the police the same day that there was pushing by both parties and she did not intend to push Wee out of the window. However, he agreed that her version about the death fall was not consistent with the Statement of Facts which she has admitted to in court. He also agreed that there was some value judgment involved in psychiatric assessment.",
      "58": "Since the first hearing before me in November 2007, s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Ed) has been amended. With effect from 1 February 2008, the punishments are imprisonment for life or for a term of up to 20 years, with a liability to fine or to caning (see Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The applicable law is that before 1 February 2008 as the offence was committed on 19 October 2005 and that law provides for imprisonment for life or for a term of up to 10 years with the same liability to fine or to caning.",
      "59": "Even though the psychiatrists opined that Ms Barokah qualified under exception 7 in s 300 of the Penal Code, \u201cintention of causing death\u201d is still a necessary ingredient of the charge here under s 304(a). This section is not all about accused persons who are suffering from depression or other mental problems. There are six other exceptions in s 300 which, if applicable, would render culpable homicide not to be murder.",
      "60": "In so far as the psychiatric evidence is concerned in this case, it is now common ground that the major depressive episode suffered by Ms Barokah can be categorized as mild instead of severe, although I note that Dr Nagulendran qualified his concession by saying that his assessment of her mental state was \u201cat the time of the alleged offence\u201d, not the weeks or months preceding that (see [52] above). Where DPD is concerned, while there is no firm diagnosis of this for the reasons stated by Dr Tommy Tan, he still has strong suspicions that DPD may be present. Where the effects of pregnancy are concerned, it cannot be seriously disputed that conception probably occurred no earlier than end September 2005. The medical evidence establishes that and it is fortified by Ms Barokah\u2019s statement to Dr Helen Chen that she had sex with her boyfriend some 4 to 5 days after starting work in Wee\u2019s flat on 20 September 2005. Further, the full-term baby girl was born on 3 July 2006 and that would be more than nine months after September 2005. Ms Barokah did not even know about her pregnancy until around mid-December 2005. She had been pregnant twice before and should be aware of the symptoms if they did surface. The prison\u2019s nursing staff certainly saw no sign of any pregnancy-related problems in November 2005 or they would have highlighted them to Dr Tommy Tan who was interviewing Ms Barokah then. As Dr Tommy Tan said, pregnancy therefore could not have been a stressor for her. I note, however, that she could have been worried about being impregnated by another man who was not her husband and the worries might have added to her problems. At the same time, such worries about pregnancy are not entirely new to her.",
      "61": "On the facts, it seems that the guilt of her two instances of infidelity coupled with her suspicions about her husband\u2019s fidelity were the predominant stressors. The pregnancy did not cause the depression and neither did the worries about pregnancy exacerbate it significantly. Given that she had interrupted sleep at night for one month because of Wee\u2019s husband, there was nothing to suggest that she could not rest at all during the day. As taking care of Wee\u2019s husband was likened by her to taking care of a baby, it should not be a very daunting task for a mother of two. Within a week of starting work at Wee\u2019s flat, she managed to have a paramour and to have sex with him. Where the sexual liaison took place and at what time of the day are not in evidence but this shows she certainly had free time and energy.",
      "62": "Dr Tommy Tan assessed the risks of re-offending at somewhere between low and moderate. This is subject to Ms Barokah having long-term (i.e. life long) psychiatric follow-up. Although he agreed there were prognostic factors favourable to her, these must be weighed against the negative factors. In my view and with utmost respect to the psychiatrists, this is an exercise in value judgment and commonsense. It involves making a considered judgment concerning the unknown future based on present known facts.",
      "63": "The risks of re-offending will in turn depend on whether Ms Barokah can effectively resolve her inner turmoil causing her depression. Her history so far has not shown encouraging signs. Within 18 months after the break-up of her first affair in Indonesia, she got herself into another one in Singapore and that within days of commencing work with new employers. While we do not judge her freedom of choice as to how she wants to live her life, if such choice leads her to depression (which it has) which then leads her to commit a serious offence (such as killing an unconscious elderly woman), then we must seriously consider whether she ought to have that freedom. It is natural for prisoners, especially inmates in their initial few years of incarceration, to behave very well in custody. We should also not place undue weight on her nursing and care for her baby girl in the 20 months or so after birth while in prison. She was a relatively new inmate in a prison in a foreign land. Her baby girl in these circumstances would be her only relative and solace. As Dr Helen Chen noted, she fared better on this score than others with liberty who may abandon their offspring. Therein lies the key difference \u2013 we are not comparing one free person with another. Of course, I do not suggest by this comment that Ms Barokah will abandon her baby girl once she is released from custody but am only cautioning against giving undue weight to an event that happened in the controlled setting of a prison.",
      "64": "I have no doubt about the sincerity and seriousness of the Indonesian Embassy\u2019s assurance given through defence counsel in his closing submissions that it will do all it can to assist Ms Barokah to receive the necessary medical or psychiatric treatment and follow-up in Indonesia upon her release from prison. This is of course dependent on whether Ms Barokah is willing to receive and comply with such treatment over the long term and whether she will again decide to work overseas.",
      "65": "As for her husband, I also have no doubt that his feelings for her are sincere and remain strong and I commend him for his forgiving attitude towards his wife. His infrequent visits to the prison may be explained by the fact that he is working outside Singapore and is obviously not holding a high position such that he could travel anytime and however often he wishes. However, I doubt very much that he will be able to manage his family\u2019s finances, especially with a growing boy and now the baby girl as well, by returning home to look for whatever work is available. He could not get by for the last seven years or so and had to work overseas. He had even prohibited his wife from working as a domestic helper but she nevertheless insisted on working as one in order to help with the family\u2019s finances. I said in my previous judgment (at [61] thereof) that \u201cthere is no evidence that her family\u2019s finances have got any better\u201d. The position has not changed after hearing all the evidence at the second hearing. There is every likelihood that Mr Isnaini and/or Ms Barokah will again feel the need to work abroad, bearing in mind the increasing needs of two growing children. They are therefore unlikely to be able to be together frequently.",
      "66": "The point is that the circumstances building up to Ms Barokah\u2019s depression and criminal conduct will still be at play and perhaps even more so in the near future. It is hard to say with any confidence that a tragic event akin to that of 19 October 2005 will not happen again. Dr Nagulendran opined that \u201cthe incident was specific to a particular set of circumstances which were reactive in nature and not due to genetic, organic or personality defects\u201d and \u201cit is unlikely that there will be a recurrence of such abnormality of mind as the causes of her mental disorder were transient and not of recurrent or lasting nature\u201d in giving a very favourable prognosis for Ms Barokah. With respect, I do not agree with his optimistic assessment. As explained above, a repeat of the situation leading to depression is likely given the propensity of Ms Barokah to become close to other men. Cut to the core, there is really nothing unique about the events that happened in the early hours of 19 October 2005. It was in essence a case of an employer reprimanding an employee who, without good reason, was not at her place of duty. The employee was clearly in the wrong and could offer no excuse. A quarrel ensued and a scuffle followed. The employee fears she will be dismissed as a result. This is hardly a most unusual situation never to be re-enacted in some form. Further, as Dr Tommy Tan said (at [40] above), there will be other events in the future which could cause Ms Barokah to be depressed again, especially when there is a 60% chance of relapse.",
      "67": "Dr Nagulendran also thought that having no prior history of violent behaviour was favourable for Ms Barokah. I ask here rhetorically who is more dangerous \u2013 a person who pushes and punches others over several periods of time or a seemingly harmless person who kills only once? Similarly, which is more violent - to throw things at a sleeping person on different occasions or to throw the sleeping person down nine floors on only one occasion? The severity of the single act of violence should surely outweigh the many comparatively minor manifestations of violence. Ms Barokah emerged from the scuffle relatively unscathed. In contrast, Wee\u2019s blood was shed and there was evidence of strangulation. Defence counsel submitted that Ms Barokah was of smaller build than Wee. Even if that is true, Ms Barokah still managed to drag Wee onto the bed and lift her out of the window. As stated in [57] of my previous judgment, there was a time lapse between the scuffle and the killing. The act of pushing Wee to her death was not a continuum of the struggle between the two women. Having no prior history of violence in a case like the present therefore does not help Ms Barokah.",
      "68": "It is my view that Ms Barokah, with or without DPD, has a brittle, volatile and violent temperament infused with largely self-induced turmoil (i.e. having sexual relationships with different men and then feeling guilty and depressed). She requires life-long follow-up and has a 60% chance of relapse of her major depressive episode. She has shown what she is capable of when depressed, even when she knows she is clearly in the wrong.",
      "69": "Defence counsel reminded me that the burden is on the prosecution to establish that an accused person is likely to remain a future and real danger to the public without medication and permanent incarceration (PP v Constance Chee [2006] 2 SLR 707 at [16]). He also submitted that considerations of general and specific deterrence have penumbral significance when dealing with accused persons with mental disorders, especially when a causal link is established between the mental disorder and the offence (Ng So Kuen Connie v PP [2003] 3 SLR 178).",
      "70": "Reference was made to Chan Seng Onn J\u2019s analysis of s 304(a) of the Penal Code in PP v Aniza bte Essa [2008] 3 SLR 832 (\u201cAniza\u201d) (at [41] to [49]) where the accused was sentenced to 9 years\u2019 imprisonment. We should note at this juncture that there is an editorial note to this case stating:",
      "71": "I am informed that the Court of Appeal has not given its decision in Aniza yet. With that cautionary note that Aniza is under appeal, I now refer to Chan Seng Onn J\u2019s analysis there. The judge opined (at [44]) that the normally high degree of culpability inherent in a s 304(a) offence cannot of itself be a sufficient criterion for imposing life imprisonment. Further, because of the huge gulf between 10 years and life imprisonment, there must be some other special reason or circumstance before the maximum is imposed (at [45]). The judge went on to say at [47]:",
      "72": "In my view, the maximum punishment in the situation envisaged above would serve the purpose of retribution, one of the 4 tenets of sentencing, rather than general deterrence.",
      "73": "Let us consider the circumstances of the killing in the current case. If the version of events put by defence counsel to Richard Chew at [22] above is correct, it would seem that Ms Barokah was very clear-thinking in the morning of 19 October 2005. It then begs the question whether she had really been so depressed and disturbed minutes earlier when she pushed Wee out of the window while Wee\u2019s husband was seeking Richard Chew\u2019s help. The evidence from Lee Seng Lim, his wife and the first two police officers buttressed what I said at [59] of my previous judgment that Ms Barokah was actually quite collected in her thought process that morning despite her depression and reinforced my assessment of her (at [57]) as a cold-blooded and dangerous killer.",
      "74": "Impairment of the mind is a matter of degree and judgment and depends to some extent on ex post facto hypothesis and the truth and accuracy of the input from the subject and others. Some mentally disturbed persons are much more impaired than others. \u201cNothing is certain in psychiatry\u201d (see [39]). In Ms Barokah\u2019s case, her actions and words showed that she was actively and consciously trying to dissociate herself from the horrendous crime against the unconscious, elderly woman. Her depressive episode was largely self-induced (by her choice to have intimate relationships) and the situation was created by her leaving Wee\u2019s flat that fateful night when she ought not to have done so. The cruel and inhumane killing was totally unjustified in the circumstances here. There should therefore be a strong measure of retribution here in addition to all the other considerations mentioned earlier.",
      "75": "Justice is not only about accused persons. As V K Rajah J (as he then was) said in PP v Aguilar Guen Garlejo [2006] 3 SLR 247 at [57]:",
      "76": "Justice is also about the victims and their families and the good of society at large. While we are concerned about the future of accused persons and their families, we must never forget the victims and their families. The victim in this case has no voice but the court\u2019s and has no future to even think about as a result of the crime.",
      "77": "Having heard all the witnesses in this second hearing, my views expressed in my previous judgment (in particular [57] to [62]) have not changed. Even if Ms Barokah does not have DPD and the references to DPD in my previous judgment are removed, her recent history still shows that she has the propensity to get into relationships with men and then feel guilty and depressed and we have seen one devastating consequence of her depression. I am still of the view that life imprisonment is the correct sentence for her and I now sentence Ms Barokah to life imprisonment with effect from the date of her arrest on 19 October 2005."

    "paragraphs": {
      "1": "This is the appeal by Ong Pang Siew (\u201cthe appellant\u201d) against conviction for the murder of his step-daughter (\u201cthe deceased\u201d) pursuant to s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cPenal Code\u201d). The charge against him states:",
      "2": "The appellant has worked as a bus driver for more than 20 years. At the material time, his employer was M/s Loh Gim Chong Transport (\u201cM/s Loh\u201d) whom he had worked for about seven months. Before his employment with M/s Loh, the appellant worked at three different transport companies for periods of 11 years, six years and one year respectively. He left the first company when it ceased operating but there is no evidence on record explaining why he left the other two companies within the space of a year. The appellant is the former husband of the deceased\u2019s mother, Xiu Yanhong (\u201cXiu\u201d). Both the deceased, who was 15 years old in 2007, and Xiu were formerly Chinese nationals.",
      "3": "The appellant met Xiu in 1997 while she was employed as an electronic production operator in a factory. He was then providing transportation for the factory\u2019s workers. When the factory closed down in 1998, Xiu found work in another factory. They continued to maintain contact and later developed a close relationship. When Xiu fell ill sometime in 1999, the appellant helped her during her convalescence. After her work permit expired in November 1999, she returned to China but remained in touch with the appellant. Eventually, she divorced the deceased\u2019s biological father sometime in 2001.",
      "4": "After her divorce, Xiu ran into serious financial difficulties and sought assistance from the appellant. He responded by visiting her in China. Once there, he rented an apartment for her and provided her with money from his savings to tide her over. Their relationship blossomed and she accepted his proposal for marriage. Following his return to Singapore, the appellant immediately made arrangements for Xiu to return to Singapore which she did in 2002. They married soon thereafter.",
      "5": "After Xiu obtained her permanent resident status in late 2002, she persuaded the appellant to arrange for the deceased to continue her education in Singapore. In November 2002, the deceased arrived in Singapore and subsequently adopted the appellant\u2019s surname, changing her name from \u201cPan Hui\u201d to \u201cOng Pan Hui\u201d. Xiu affirmed that the appellant\u2019s relationship with the deceased was initially good and he doted on the deceased.",
      "6": "On 8 August 2003, Xiu gave birth to their son, GHK (\u201cGHK\u201d). Unfortunately, the relationship between the appellant and Xiu deteriorated rapidly, soon after. Xiu had begun working as a masseuse. Subsequently, Xiu worked at three different massage parlours between 2003 and 2005. Because the appellant was unhappy with the nature of her work, he and Xiu had frequent quarrels. In turn, she complained about his gambling habits. The appellant also heard from his neighbours that different men were sending Xiu home and that Xiu had become \u201cvery sexy\u201d. In 2005, Xiu had two miscarriages. Following this, the appellant accused Xiu of having affairs with other men in the course of her work as a masseuse. This further damaged their relationship. Xiu, for her part, insisted on continuing with the same line of work. She claimed the additional income was needed to support her parents in China.",
      "7": "In January 2006, Xiu started her own massage parlour, employing her savings as well as loans from her friends. Despite his continuing and profound misgivings, the appellant also contributed about $2,000 to the business. Xiu operated the business without a permit and was fined twice before she terminated it. At around the same time, Xiu\u2019s previous employer offered to sell her business to Xiu. She accepted this offer. The appellant contributed about $5,000 to this enterprise. Xiu subsequently spent even more time at work as she attempted to grow the business. As a result of their long working hours and loss of trust, the relationship between the appellant and Xiu inexorably broke down. Xiu testified that \u201csometimes his temperament was good, but sometimes it was bad\u201d. However, she also affirmed that the appellant had never been violent and would never \u201clay a hand\u201d on her.",
      "8": "Sometime in March 2007, the appellant and Xiu had a heated argument because the appellant insisted that Xiu should stop working as a masseuse. More bitter recriminations followed and on 1 April 2007, Xiu moved out of the matrimonial home to a rented flat (\u201cXiu\u2019s flat\u201d) with the deceased and GHK. It was also around this time that the appellant started working for M/s Loh.",
      "9": "On 15 May 2007, Xiu initiated divorce proceedings citing unreasonable behaviour on the part of the appellant. The Statement of Particulars for the divorce alleged, inter alia, that after the marriage the appellant was easily irritated and often lost his temper. Further, it was asserted that in November 2005, the appellant made Xiu and the children leave the matrimonial home after Xiu took a lift home from a male customer late at night. He allegedly only allowed them to return home three months later. The appellant, who had no legal representation, did not contest the divorce proceedings. In early October 2007, Xiu obtained sole custody of the deceased. She was also granted sole care and control of GHK while the appellant was granted access to GHK from 9.00am on Saturdays to 9.00pm on Sundays. Xiu, in the meantime, secured her Singapore citizenship in August 2007.",
      "10": "After the divorce, the appellant and Xiu agreed that she would send GHK to City Hall MRT station every Saturday between 11.00am to 12.00 noon where she would hand care and control of GHK to him. The appellant would then send GHK back to Xiu on Sunday nights. This arrangement soon led to further friction. The appellant stated in his police statement (and testified) that Xiu often did not allow him to have access to GHK by making up excuses at the last moment. Xiu, however, denied this.",
      "11": "On 20 October 2007, the appellant was entitled to have access to GHK as it was a Saturday. However, after working late into Friday night, he woke up at about 10.30am. As he did not have any driving assignment that day, he went for coffee at the market near his place until about 12.00 noon. After that, he went home to attend to his laundry. At about 1.00pm, a friend invited him for a drink. He arrived at the coffee-shop at about 3.25pm. Together with four of his friends, the appellant stayed at the coffee-shop until about 9.00pm. During this period, they drank more than 20 bottles of beer, with the appellant consuming the most with another friend.",
      "12": "After the appellant left the coffee-shop, he called Xiu to ask for access to GHK. However, Xiu told him that GHK was at her shop in East Coast and that if he wanted to see GHK, he would have to go to the shop.This upset the appellant and they heatedly quarrelled over the telephone. Xiu hung up on the appellant but the appellant called Xiu repeatedly and uttered profanities at her as he was very angry.",
      "13": "After failing to obtain Xiu\u2019s agreement on access to GHK that night, the appellant decided to go to Xiu\u2019s flat. This was nearby. He walked back to his HDB block, retrieved his bicycle and cycled to Xiu\u2019s flat. The appellant testified that he had gone to Xiu\u2019s flat for several reasons. He wanted to know if the deceased was happy after obtaining her Singapore citizenship and to ascertain her examination results. He also hoped that when Xiu returned, he could bring GHK back to his place. Further, he wanted to ask the deceased why she had hit and threatened GHK. According to the appellant, this was not the first time he had questioned the deceased on this issue. These reasons were rejected by the trial judge who determined that the appellant had gone to Xiu\u2019s flat solely to kill the deceased. We pause here to note that the Prosecution no longer supports this finding of fact by the trial judge: see [35] below.",
      "14": "When the appellant arrived at Xiu\u2019s place, the deceased opened the door and let him into the flat. At this time, the two sub-tenants of Xiu\u2019s flat, Zhao Jing and Liu Qiao Xiao (\u201cLiu\u201d), were both in their bedroom. About two to three minutes later, Zhao Jing walked to the toilet in the kitchen to take a shower. As she did so, she saw the appellant sitting beside the deceased near the computer table in the living room and noted that they were \u201ctalking in a normal manner\u201d and that they were \u201cnot quarrelling\u201d. After her shower while returning to her room, Zhao Jing heard the appellant talking and his tone sounded like he was laughing.",
      "15": "Soon after, Zhao Jing heard a loud scream. The deceased started calling out her name very loudly. Sensing that something was wrong, she opened her bedroom door and saw the deceased lying on the floor. The chair which the deceased was previously sitting on had toppled over and the appellant was squatting beside her. Zhao Jing moved closer to the kitchen and saw the appellant holding the deceased\u2019s ear with one hand and her hair with his other hand. The appellant was banging the deceased\u2019s head against the floor continuously and repeatedly shouted \u201cWho am I\u201d in Mandarin. In his testimony, the appellant claimed that the deceased was \u201cvery angry\u201d, \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and had suddenly taken \u201csomething\u201d from the computer table before he grabbed hold of her.",
      "16": "When Zhao Jing tried to persuade the appellant to release his hands, the appellant looked up at her. He stopped banging the deceased\u2019s head against the floor but his hands were still on her ear and hair. The appellant was extremely agitated. He told Zhao Jing that he was the deceased\u2019s father and that Xiu had abandoned him. At the same time, the deceased entreated Zhao Jing in a very weak voice to call \u201c999\u201d. Zhao Jing returned to her bedroom. Concluding that this was a case of family violence, she decided to call Xiu instead of the police. As Zhao Jing and Liu could not locate Xiu\u2019s number on their mobile phones, Zhao Jing went to the living room to get the deceased\u2019s mobile phone. The appellant did not prevent her from doing so. After retrieving it, Zhao Jing returned to her bedroom and called Xiu who told her that she was rushing back home and to call for the police.",
      "17": "After the telephone conversation, Zhao Jing proceeded to the living room again and noticed that one of the appellant\u2019s hands was on the deceased\u2019s neck even though he was not applying any force then. He was simply sitting on the deceased who was lying on the floor. Zhao Jing tried to persuade him to release his hand but the appellant ignored her. He continued to complain aloud that Xiu had abandoned him and that she was a bad woman. As the appellant remained very agitated, Zhao Jing did not attempt to contradict him. She observed that, by then, the deceased had stopped moving and her face and feet had turned purplish.",
      "18": "Zhao Jing then ran back to her room and, as she was doing so, noticed a knife handle without a blade lying by the side of the appellant. On returning to the room, Zhao Jing told Liu that she was going to the police post to seek help. When she found the police post closed, she returned to the flat and observed that the main gate had been padlocked. She gained entrance by using her keys to open the main gate and saw that the appellant was using his mobile phone whilst still sitting on top of the deceased.",
      "19": "Zhao Jing left the flat again, without closing the gate and wooden door, to call the police using her phone. She met the police officers at the common staircase when they arrived and brought them to Xiu\u2019s flat. As the wooden door had again been closed, she had to use her keys to open it. After entering the flat, she noticed that the appellant remained seated on top of the deceased. Zhao Jing then asked the appellant why he had hurt the deceased. In response, he once again started berating Xiu and all Chinese women.",
      "20": "It has been established that soon after the appellant strangled the deceased, he made several telephone calls using his mobile phone. He called his second brother, Ong Pang In (\u201cPang In\u201d), to inform him that he had killed the deceased and that he \u201cwanted to jump\u201d to his death. He requested Pang In to cremate him and to throw the ashes into the sea. However, he was persuaded by Pang In to wait for the police to arrive. The appellant next called the sales manager of M/s Loh, Mr Loh Kian Choon (\u201cMr Loh\u201d), to inform him of his actions and apologised for being unable to work for M/s Loh anymore. He also told Mr Loh that the key to the company\u2019s bus was at his home. The appellant also called Xiu to tell her that he had killed the deceased. According to Xiu, he sounded calm and as if \u201che was the victor\u201d.",
      "21": "According to Staff Sergeant Lee Chee Mun Tarmizi (\u201cSsgt Lee\u201d) of the Civil Defence Force, he and his crew arrived at Blk 24 of Marsiling Drive at about 10.34pm. When they reached the sixth floor staircase landing after coming out of the lift, they met a Chinese female (presumably Zhao Jing) who vigorously gestured to them and led them to Xiu\u2019s flat. Ssgt Lee was the first to speak to the appellant. He asked the appellant to move aside. The appellant complied with this direction but repeatedly said to him \u201cNo hope\u201d in Mandarin.",
      "22": "Shortly after the police officers arrived at Xiu\u2019s flat, the appellant gave his police statement to Sergeant Chng Chee Wee (\u201cSgt Chng\u201d). In summary, the appellant stated that he did not go to Xiu\u2019s flat with any intention of killing the deceased. He only formed such an intention after quarrelling with Xiu when he called Xiu whilst in the flat. The appellant then strangled the deceased (while apologising to the deceased at the same time) in order to cause Xiu to feel the pain of losing a loved one. This statement was relied upon by the trial judge to find that the appellant has gone to Xiu\u2019s flat with the sole intention of killing the deceased.",
      "23": "Three police officers testified that the appellant \u201csmelt\u201d of alcohol when they saw him. According to Sgt Chng, the appellant would suddenly alternate between laughing and crying while at Xiu\u2019s flat. While the appellant was being interviewed by Station Inspector Low Soon Hoe in the temporary holding area, he appeared to be tipsy. Suddenly, he began to knock his head against the wall violently and had to be restrained. The appellant was subsequently given a medical examination at 1.24am on 21 October 2007, about three hours after the offence. His blood was also taken for alcohol testing (\u201cBAC\u201d) and found to contain 84mg of ethanol per 100ml of blood.",
      "24": "An autopsy was carried out on the deceased on 21 October 2007. Dr Teo Eng Swee (\u201cDr Teo\u201d), a consultant forensic pathologist at the Health Sciences Authority, certified that the deceased died from strangulation. During trial, he testified that \u201cmoderate to severe force\u201d must have been applied to the deceased\u2019s neck in order to cause strangulation.",
      "25": "The autopsy report also revealed that the deceased suffered from several superficial incision and puncture wounds on her neck, limb and abdomen. Dr Teo testified that the broken blade found in Xiu\u2019s flat was the cause of the incision and puncture wounds. He stated that the superficiality of the incision wounds at the neck suggested that they were not inflicted during a struggle; otherwise the incision would have been deeper or less even. However, he admitted that it was not possible to assert with any certainty whether these were peri or post mortem injuries.",
      "26": "As the fact of the killing was not disputed, the trial judge noted, in PP v Ong Pang Siew [2009] 4 SLR(R) 474 (\u201cthe judgment\u201d) (at [41]), that the only remaining issues were whether the appellant intended to cause the death of the deceased and whether he was entitled to the defence of diminished responsibility found in Exception 7 of s 300 of the Penal Code.",
      "27": "The trial judge rejected the appellant\u2019s evidence that he had gone to Xiu\u2019s flat to wait for GHK (see [42] of the judgment). He relied on the fact that the appellant was free for the whole of that Saturday but chose to spend his time doing household chores and drinking beer with his friends for five to six hours. The trial judge found (at [43] of the judgment) that the appellant felt betrayed by Xiu after he had given her and the deceased a new life in Singapore. After the quarrel over the phone with Xiu about access to GHK, the appellant had proceeded to Xiu\u2019s flat with the intention of killing the deceased so that Xiu could experience the pain of losing a loved one in the same way that he did after the family broke up (see [43] and [47] of the judgment).",
      "28": "The trial judge took into account the following conduct of the appellant in determining that he was rational and had intended to kill the deceased:\n(a)     After the deceased was pinned to the floor by the appellant, he carried on hitting her head against the floor, sat on top of her and strangled her. The appellant knew what he was doing and was able to respond coherently to Zhao Jing\u2019s pleas to let the deceased go (see [44] of the judgment).\n(b)     The appellant obviously used the knife\u2019s blade to make controlled and deliberate cuts on the deceased\u2019s body. Whether the appellant inflicted the wounds before or after the deceased\u2019s death made no material difference since they were intentional (see [45] of the judgment).\n(c)     The appellant\u2019s conversations with Mr Loh and Xiu after the deceased\u2019s death and the subsequent communication with the police officers who arrived at Xiu\u2019s flat, viz, his request to go to the toilet, his knowledge of how serious his actions were and that he would pay with his own life, showed his clarity of mind (see [46] of the judgment).",
      "29": "As for the defence of diminished responsibility, the trial judge rejected the defence\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion that the appellant suffered from major depressive disorder. Instead, he accepted the Prosecution\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion that the appellant had no mental illness (see [53] of the judgment). He held that even if the appellant was suffering from a major depressive episode, there had been no substantial impairment of his mental responsibility for his acts that night (see [54] of the judgment). Accordingly, he found that the Prosecution had made out its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt and that the defence of diminished responsibility failed on a balance of probabilities. The appellant was found guilty and convicted of murder.",
      "30": "In this appeal, the appellant\u2019s submissions centred upon three issues. It was argued that:\n(a)     the appellant did not intend to kill the deceased (\u201cthe s 300(a) submission\u201d);\n(b)     the appellant did not intend to inflict the injury which resulted in the death of the deceased (\u201cthe s 300(c) submission\u201d); and\n(c)     the appellant qualified for the defence of diminished responsibility because he was suffering from a major depressive disorder which led to a substantial impairment of his mental responsibility at the time of the offence (\u201cthe diminished responsibility submission\u201d).",
      "31": "The Prosecution, on the other hand, submitted as follows:\n(a)     the trial judge\u2019s finding that the appellant possessed the intention to kill the deceased should not be disturbed as the appellant was capable of rational thought at the material time. The finding of facts was not plainly wrong or arrived at against the weight of the evidence on record;\n(b)     the appellant, by strangling the deceased, intended to cause the injuries to her neck which was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; and\n(c)     the trial judge was correct in holding that the appellant was not suffering from an abnormality of mind which substantially impaired his mental responsibility at the time he killed the deceased.",
      "32": "We preface our review of the matter by pointing out that if the defence of diminished responsibility is made out, the conviction of murder will have to be set aside and substituted by a conviction of culpable homicide not amounting to murder as provided by Exception 7 in s 300 of the Penal Code.",
      "33": "We will first address, briefly, the trial judge\u2019s finding of fact that the appellant had gone to Xiu\u2019s flat with the sole intention of killing the deceased. He held that the appellant intended to cause the deceased\u2019s death when he went to Xiu\u2019s flat (see [42]\u2013[47] of the judgment). However, in our view, this finding is not supported by the evidence. The appellant had called Xiu at about 8.39pm on the day of the offence to ask for access to GHK. A heated quarrel soon ensued between them. Much was made of this fact by the Prosecution in the High Court to establish that the appellant had proceeded to Xiu\u2019s flat with the intention of killing the deceased as he was very angry with her. The trial judge accepted this submission and observed that if the appellant had really wanted to see GHK, he could have gone to Xiu\u2019s shop in the East Coast to pick him up (see the judgment at [42]).",
      "34": "However, it should also be noted that the appellant knew that Xiu would eventually return to the flat with GHK and he could pick GHK up from Xiu\u2019s flat, which was only a few minutes away from his home. There was thus good reason for the appellant to go directly to Xiu\u2019s flat in Marsiling instead of going to her shop in East Coast which was much farther away and required motorised transport to reach. Furthermore, if the appellant had indeed gone to Xiu\u2019s flat just to kill the deceased, there was no explanation for the time he spent amiably conversing with her. He also knew that there were tenants in Xiu\u2019s flat who would recognise him if he harmed the deceased. Zhao Jing had testified that when she first saw the appellant, he was talking to the deceased in a normal manner and they were not quarrelling. In fact, she stated that the appellant\u2019s tone \u201csounded like he was laughing\u201d. Further, he made no attempt to conceal his identity from Zhao Jing and Liu and in fact revealed to Zhao Jing that he was the deceased\u2019s father. In addition, the police statement recorded by Sgt Chng at Xiu\u2019s flat, which the trial judge relied on in concluding that the appellant had intended to cause the deceased\u2019s death, also clearly emphasised that the appellant had gone to Xiu\u2019s flat without any intention of killing her. Sgt Chng recorded the appellant as informing him that \u201c[the appellant] came to the unit with no intention to kill [the deceased] at all\u201d [emphasis added].",
      "35": "In the course of oral submission, the Prosecution conceded, after questioning from this court, that the evidence could not support the trial judge\u2019s finding that the appellant had gone to the flat with the intention of killing the deceased. Instead, it submitted that the appellant had probably formed the intention after he had \u201csnapped\u201d. This concession necessarily throws a different light on the subsequent events that led to the killing of the deceased by the appellant. We should add that if the Prosecution had not made this concession, we would have found this to be a fact.",
      "36": "We accept that after he \u201csnapped\u201d, the appellant intended to seriously harm, if not kill, the deceased. He must have known that his act of strangling her might likely kill her or, at the very least, cause injuries that would in the ordinary course have been sufficient to kill her. The pathologist confirmed that moderate to severe force was used in the strangulation. The death was not an accident. There is also undisputed evidence that while strangling the deceased, the appellant also apologised to her for the harm caused. This was recorded by Sgt Chng on a piece of paper (and subsequently copied to his police patrol log sheet) when he interviewed the appellant at Xiu\u2019s flat. We further note that after the deceased stopped moving, the appellant called in quick succession Pang In, Mr Loh as well as Xiu to inform them that he had killed the deceased. Certainly, at some level of consciousness the appellant was aware of what he was doing. In the circumstances, we accept that the Prosecution has established that the appellant intentionally committed an act of homicide. The crucial issue is whether he was suffering from diminished responsibility at the material time.",
      "37": "The trial judge rejected this defence because he found that the appellant was \u201clucid and knew what he was doing\u201d. The trial judge also thought that the appellant\u2019s ability to respond coherently to Zhao Jing\u2019s pleas to let go of the deceased \u201cpointed clearly to a rational person in possession of all his senses\u201d (at [54] of the judgment). With respect, this finding (for the reasons we give below) over-simplified a complex amalgam of issues. It failed to adequately take into account a crucial mass of evidence which unmistakeably shows that many aspects of the appellant\u2019s conduct that night were nothing short of bizarre, if not entirely abnormal, when assessed holistically. The fact that an accused may seem to behave rationally or respond coherently at different points during an offending incident is by no means determinative of the applicability of the defence of diminished responsibility (see below at [61]). Individuals suffering from some types of serious mental illnesses do not entirely lose their ability to think or function normally throughout (or even after) an offending episode. A failure to appreciate this aspect of certain types of mental illnesses can lead to an erroneous rejection of this statutory defence.",
      "38": "In this case, the expert witnesses called by the Prosecution and the appellant could not agree on whether, at the material time, the appellant was suffering from a major depressive episode that caused an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts in causing the death of the deceased. The principles to be applied by an appellate court in assessing a trial judge\u2019s findings on expert evidence have been set out in Sakthivel Punithavathi v PP [2007] 2 SLR(R) 983 as follows:",
      "39": "Before setting out the expert witnesses\u2019 respective opinions, it would be useful to discuss the symptoms and established guidelines for the diagnosis of a major depressive episode.",
      "40": "Both expert witnesses relied on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Ed) (\u201cDSM-IV-TR\u201d). The DSM-IV-TR is published by the American Psychiatric Association. It provides the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals around the world and is used in their diagnosis of patients across different clinical settings (see http://www.psych.org/MainMenu/Research/DSMIV.aspx, accessed on 8 November 2010).",
      "41": "In order to establish a diagnosis of major depressive episode, there are several criteria which have to be satisfied. In the context of this appeal, Criteria B, D and E are not relevant. Criterion B is concerned with symptoms relating to a mixed episode (consisting of both manic episode and major depressive episode). Criteria D and E deal with symptoms arising directly from the physiological effects of a substance or general medical condition and with symptoms not accounted for by bereavement. Only Criteria A and C are relevant, and they state:",
      "42": "The DSM-IV-TR provides (at pp 349\u2013350) that the essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least two consecutive weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. It further states that \u201c[f]amily members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations\u201d and appetite is usually reduced. Many who suffer from a major depressive episode feel that they have to force themselves to eat and where appetite reduction is severe; there may be a significant loss in weight.",
      "43": "The DSM-IV-TR also emphasises (at p 351) the importance of a careful interview in the elicitation of symptoms of a major depressive episode:",
      "44": "In conducting a diagnosis of a patient, it is important to ensure that the interviews with the patient are carried out carefully. Additional information from people who would ordinarily interact with the patient would be especially useful. Obviously, the patient, being unwell, may not be the best source of information of his own mental state. It is also not unusual for patients to play down their difficulties or be in a state of denial. DSM-IV-TR further highlights that the evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult when they occur in an individual who also has a general medical condition (eg, cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction and diabetes) due to the overlap in their signs and symptoms. Such symptoms should count towards a major depressive episode unless they are clearly and fully accounted for by a general medical condition. Statistics stated in DSM-IV-TR show that up to 20% to 25% of individuals with these aforesaid medical conditions will develop a major depressive disorder during the course of their general medical conditions. In the Clinical Practice Guidelines, Depression published in March 2004 (Ministry of Health, Singapore), it is noted (at p 4) that there is a high prevalence of depression in Singapore, with a percentage of 8.6% in adults. Further, depression can co-exist with many medical conditions such as cancers (25%\u201338%), diabetes (24%) or coronary artery disease (16%\u201319%) (see http://www.hpp.moh.gov.sg/HPP/MungoBlobs/217/148/2004%20Depression_0.pdf, accessed on 8 November 2010).",
      "45": "Several other factors which may lead to or contribute to a major depressive disorder as provided in the DSM-IV-TR should be noted at this point. First, episodes of a major depressive disorder often follow a severe psycho-social stressor, such as the death of a loved one or a divorce. Also, substance dependence (particularly alcohol or cocaine dependence) may contribute to the onset or exacerbation of a major depressive disorder. Third, a major depressive disorder is one point five to three times more common among first-degree biological relatives of persons with this disorder than among the general population.",
      "46": "Having considered the symptoms and guidelines for the diagnostic process of a major depressive episode, we now set out the expert opinions.",
      "47": "At the trial, Dr Tommy Tan (\u201cDr Tan\u201d), a psychiatrist of some 15 years\u2019 experience who is currently in private practice, testified on behalf of the appellant. Dr Tan graduated from the National University of Singapore and has a Master of Medicine degree in Psychiatry. He was previously the senior consultant in the Department of Forensic Psychiatry of the Institute of Mental Health. He has given expert evidence in the High Court on behalf of the Prosecution in capital cases on numerous occasions.",
      "48": "Dr Tan examined the appellant on three occasions in August 2008. He communicated with the appellant in the Hokkien dialect as the appellant was more comfortable conversing in Hokkien than in Mandarin. Dr Tan said this helped him to establish good rapport with the appellant and allowed him to elicit more information from him. Dr Tan also interviewed Pang In, the appellant\u2019s second sister, Sally Ong (\u201cSally\u201d), and fourth sister, Ong Ah Soi. Before examining the appellant, Dr Tan read the report of the Prosecution\u2019s expert, Dr Jerome Goh Hern Yee (\u201cDr Goh\u201d), dated 21 November 2007 (\u201cDr Goh\u2019s first report) and the nursing observation charts at the Changi Complex Medical Centre where the appellant was remanded.",
      "49": "In his report dated 25 August 2008 (\u201cDr Tan\u2019s report\u201d), Dr Tan noted that the appellant has a \u201cstrong family history of mental disorder\u201d and gave a description of the appellant\u2019s background, his marital problems with Xiu, his psychiatric symptoms and observations of his recent behaviour by his family members. Dr Tan gave his psychiatric diagnosis as follows:",
      "50": "In rebuttal of Dr Tan\u2019s evidence, the Prosecution called Dr Goh to give his expert opinion. Dr Goh has a Masters degree in Psychiatry Medicine and a Masters degree in Clinical Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology (London). He has been an associate consultant at the Institute of Mental Health for about eight years. In these eight years, Dr Goh has given expert evidence once in the High Court and five times in the Subordinate Courts. The evidence in the High Court was on the mental health of an accused charged with a sexual offence. This case was the first occasion when Dr Goh gave expert evidence on the mental state of an accused facing a capital charge.",
      "51": "Dr Goh examined the appellant on three occasions in November 2007 about three weeks after the offence. Unlike Dr Tan, Dr Goh conducted his examination of the appellant in Mandarin, notwithstanding the fact that the appellant was \u201cmore comfortable with Hokkien\u201d and had told Dr Goh that he would \u201clike to speak in Hokkien\u201d. Although Dr Goh explained to the appellant that he could seek any clarification needed, he conceded that he did not tell the appellant that he could provide an interpreter for the examination.",
      "52": "Before diagnosing the appellant, Dr Goh spoke to Pang In and another sister of the appellant, Ong Tok May (\u201cTok May\u201d), on 15 November 2007. It appears that only brief details about the appellant\u2019s behaviour were obtained during this meeting. Dr Goh learnt that the appellant was feeling \u201cpek chek\u201d (frustrated) and \u201ca bit sad\u201d but was able to work. The focus of that particular interview was on the appellant\u2019s family history of mental disorder. Pang In suffered from depression and was then undergoing follow-up sessions. In addition, Tok May was taking haloperidol, an anti-psychotic drug because \u201cshe thinks a lot\u201d. Also, the appellant\u2019s mother had taken some prescribed medication at a private clinic \u201cto calm down\u201d.",
      "53": "Dr Goh wrote two reports. The first, earlier referenced as \u201cDr Goh\u2019s first report\u201d, was dated 21 November 2007 (see [47] above) and the other was dated 15 September 2008 (\u201cDr Goh\u2019s second report\u201d). In Dr Goh\u2019s first report, he gave a brief account of the appellant\u2019s personal background, his marital history and noted that Pang In said the appellant was not \u201cphysically or verbally aggressive by nature and that he is very responsible in his work and well liked by his bosses\u201d. The material part of Dr Goh\u2019s first report stated:",
      "54": "Dr Goh\u2019s second report was written after he had the opportunity to consider Dr Tan\u2019s report. This report, in its entirety, read:",
      "55": "Although both Dr Tan and Dr Goh acknowledged the significance of the appellant\u2019s family history of mental disorder, neither of them enquired deeply into the precise nature of the mental disease(s) affecting the appellant\u2019s family members and whether they were hereditary in nature. As stated (at [29] above), the trial judge accepted Dr Goh\u2019s evidence that the appellant was not suffering from a major depressive episode at the time of the offence.",
      "56": "Before we evaluate the evidence of the two experts, it will be useful to set out generally the law on the defence of diminished responsibility.",
      "57": "The defence of diminished responsibility is encapsulated in Exception 7 of s 300 of the Penal Code, which reads as follows:",
      "58": "Exception 7 was derived from s 2 of the English Homicide Act, 1957: see second reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (24 May 1961) vol 14 at cols 1509\u20131510 (K M Byrne, Minister for Labour and Law). The effect of this defence is that:",
      "59": "(See Report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment (1949\u20131953) (Cmnd 8932) at para 378.) The defence attempts to distinguish between different levels of control or consciousness that a particular accused may have when the homicide is committed. An accused who kills while suffering from the prescribed state of mental abnormality is seen by the law to be morally less culpable and less deserving of extreme punishment than one in full possession of his faculties. However, as Prof Glanville Williams has penetratingly observed in Glanville Williams, Textbook of Criminal Law (Stevens & Sons, 2nd Ed, 1983) at p 686:",
      "60": "It is trite law that the appellant bears the burden of proving the defence of diminished responsibility on a balance of probabilities: see Chua Hwa Soon Jimmy v PP [1998] 1 SLR(R) 601 (at [8]) (\u201cJimmy Chua\u201d). In Took Leng How v PP [2006] 2 SLR(R) 70, this court reiterated (at [46]) the three-limb test which an accused has to satisfy to establish the defence of diminished responsibility:\n(a)     the accused was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time he caused the victim\u2019s death;\n(b)     the abnormality of mind arose from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes, or was induced by disease or injury; and\n(c)     the abnormality of mind substantially impaired the accused\u2019s mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the death.",
      "61": "This court held that whilst limb (b) (otherwise known as the aetiology or root cause of the abnormality) is a matter largely within the purview of expert opinion, limb (a) and limb (c) are matters which cannot be the subject of any medical opinion and must be left to the determination of the trial judge, as the finder of fact. In doing so, the trial judge is, in the words of Lord Keith of Kinkel in Walton v The Queen [1978] AC 788 (at 793):",
      "62": "Hence, in considering whether the defence of diminished responsibility has been established, not only does the trial judge have to consider the medical evidence, he is also required to take into account all other relevant facts and circumstances of the case, including the conduct of the accused before, during and after the offence: see Jimmy Chua (at [28]\u2013[29]).",
      "63": "What amounts to an \u201cabnormality of mind\u201d under the defence of diminished responsibility has been explicated in R v Byrne [1960] 2 QB 396 (\u201cR v Byrne\u201d) (at 403) by Lord Parker CJ as follows:",
      "64": "This interpretation was accepted as correct and authoritative by the Privy Council in Elvan Rose v The Queen [1961] AC 496 (at 507). Lord Tucker clarified (at 507\u2013508) that the test is not necessarily \u201cthe borderline of insanity\u201d:",
      "65": "Lord Tucker correctly emphasised (at 508) that \u201ca man may know what he is doing and intend to do it and yet suffer from such abnormality of mind as substantially impairs his mental responsibility\u201d [emphasis added].",
      "66": "Lord Parker CJ\u2019s interpretation in R v Byrne of the term \u201cabnormality of mind\u201d has also been accepted by this court in Jimmy Chua ([58] supra at [22]) and Mansoor s/o Abdullah v PP [1998] 3 SLR(R) 403 (at [13]) for the purposes of limb (a) of Exception 7. In Jimmy Chua (at [23]), this court approvingly cited R v Seers (1984) 79 Cr App R 261, where Griffiths LJ held that chronic reactive depression could on the evidence before him sustain the defence of diminished responsibility. We should add that the nature of the causative injury can be either physical or psychological. A reactive depression caused by extreme adversity or stress may establish the exception: see R v Bathurst [1968] 2 QB 99; G Krishnasamy Naidu v PP [2006] 4 SLR(R) 874 (\u201cNaidu\u201d); PP v Juminem [2005] 4 SLR(R) 536 (\u201cJuminem\u201d).",
      "67": "What in fact amounts to a substantial impairment of mental responsibility is largely a question of commonsense to be decided by the trial judge as the finder of fact. As a working guide, substantial does not require a total impairment; neither is it trivial nor minimal: see Juminem (at [30]) applying Regina v Lloyd [1967] 1 QB 175 (at 178). As stated above, while medical evidence would be important in determining the presence and/or extent of impairment, whether an accused\u2019s mental responsibility was substantially impaired is ultimately a question to be decided by the court based on all the evidence before it: see Zailani bin Ahmad v PP [2005] 1 SLR(R) 356 (at [52]). The courts have flexibly construed similar provisions in England and New South Wales and have declined to confine the defence to just clinically recognised illnesses. Indeed, the phrase \u201cabnormality of mind\u201d is wide enough to cover all aspects of the mind\u2019s activities including transient or ephemeral manifestations of illnesses, though as a matter of construction (and policy) the courts have excluded \u201cmental disorders\u201d solely attributable to the consumption or mal-administration of alcohol, drugs or other like substances. Such disorders are not due to inherent causes. The exception would also not apply to emotions of rage, prejudices, hate, passing jealousy and the like unless they are due to inherent causes rather than external stimuli alone. However, if those emotions trigger an inherent internal derangement that culminates in a pathological condition (eg, morbid jealousy), then the exception could apply: see Naidu (at [9]\u2013[10]).",
      "68": "In reviewing the trial judge\u2019s decision, we are conscious that, as an appellate court, we should be slow to overturn his findings of fact unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. However, when it comes to inferences of facts to be drawn from the actual findings, a different approach will be taken. An appellate court in such cases is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case. Intervention by an appellate court is justified when the inferences drawn by a trial judge are not supported by the primary or objective evidence on record: Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (at [38]).",
      "69": "Dr Goh, in his evidence, accepted that in order to diagnose the appellant\u2019s mental condition, it was necessary for him to examine the appellant and to obtain information from those close to him on whether the appellant was suffering from any impairment of functioning in the relevant period. Further, when evaluating the symptoms of depression elicited from the appellant, he had to clarify whether there was any significant impairment in his social functioning, such as his interaction with friends, his time spent with his son and whether there was any occupational impairment such as inability or difficulty in carrying on with his work.",
      "70": "This approach appears in line with the guidelines in the diagnostic process provided by the DSM-IV-TR (see above at [42]\u2013[43]). However, instead of adhering to this requisite standard, Dr Goh merely relied upon his interviews with the appellant, Pang In and Tok May, and the nurses\u2019 psychiatric observation charts to arrive at his conclusion that the appellant was not suffering from any mental illness. No interviews were conducted with those who had the most recent and closest contact with the appellant, namely, Xiu, GHK, Mr Loh or even the appellant\u2019s drinking friends. These were the people who also had frequent contact with the appellant and would have been able to provide Dr Goh with crucial information that could have shed much light on the appellant\u2019s mental state at the time he committed the offence. We are puzzled why Dr Goh did not do this. As the Prosecution\u2019s expert, he would have had little difficulty making arrangements to interview these persons.",
      "71": "We noted earlier that the appellant\u2019s previous periods of employment lasted 11 years, six years and one year successively and, at the time of the offence, he had been working at M/s Loh for only about seven months. It therefore appears that within a period of less than 18 months preceding the death of the deceased, the appellant had three different employers. This pattern was particularly striking since it departed starkly from his earlier employment history. No evidence was led by the Prosecution on the reasons for these rapid job changes. What happened and why did it happen? These facts could be important but they were never looked into by Dr Goh. What was his state of mind during the months leading up to the offence? After all, he was having severe marital problems around this period of time. How did this affect his work? As occupational impairment is a symptom of major depressive disorder, the reasons that led the appellant to leave or be told to leave his two earlier jobs could be significant. Although Dr Goh was told about the appellant\u2019s employment history, he did not regard it as material. Instead, Dr Goh\u2019s first report noted that the appellant often worked for \u201cmany years for the same company\u201d which, although true for the most part of his employment history, was certainly inaccurate for the one and a half years preceding the killing.",
      "72": "As for the interview with Pang In and Tok May, it was largely focused on their personal history of mental disorder with only cursory details about the appellant\u2019s health being discussed. Dr Goh acknowledged that the appellant\u2019s purported weight loss was an important issue since it is a symptom of depression; yet he did not ask the siblings about this issue at all. Further, Dr Goh did not try to find out the nature of the actual mental ailments afflicting Pang In, Tok May and the appellant\u2019s mother. In Dr Goh\u2019s first report, he merely stated that Pang In was being treated for depression, with no mention of the mental history of Tok May and the appellant\u2019s mother. Despite reading Dr Tan\u2019s report, Dr Goh did not seek further clarification or to obtain more details about the \u201cstrong family history of mental disorder\u201d from either Pang In or Tok May. It appears to us that he did not consider the family history factor as significant enough to warrant a second look despite the possible increased risk (one point five to three times) of the appellant developing a major depressive disorder on the basis of this factor alone.",
      "73": "We have highlighted above that it appears that 20% to 25% of diabetic persons may suffer from major depressive disorder. It is not disputed that the appellant suffered from hypertension and diabetes. This was noted in Dr Goh\u2019s first report yet the correlation between diabetes and major depressive disorder did not appear to have been properly considered by Dr Goh.",
      "74": "Another worrying feature about Dr Goh\u2019s examination of the appellant was that it was conducted in Mandarin when the appellant\u2019s preferred language of communication was Hokkien. The trial judge stated (at [52] of the judgment) that the appellant must have been conversant in Mandarin since Xiu is from China and spoke to him in Mandarin. However, there is no evidence on the nature of the conversations between the appellant and Xiu or about the appellant\u2019s level of proficiency in Mandarin. Given the difficulty in eliciting symptoms of a major depressive disorder without clear communication, it would have been prudent for Dr Goh to have arranged for a Hokkien interpreter to be present for the interviews, something which could have been easily done. We note that in the course of cross-examination, Dr Goh acknowledged the possibility of miscommunication between the appellant\u2019s account of his mental health and Dr Goh\u2019s comprehension of the account given the lack of a common language.",
      "75": "In our view, Dr Goh\u2019s diagnostic process fell short of the requisite standard prescribed under the DSM-IV-TR. In response to our concerns about the above matters, the Prosecution submitted that while there are protocols which psychiatrists bear in mind when diagnosing patients, in some cases they nevertheless rely on their own experience in their assessments, this being one of those cases. We were not impressed by this attempt to paper over the obvious shortcomings. After all, this was the first case in which Dr Goh had testified as an expert witness on a murder charge. It would be a stretch to suggest that Dr Goh had any meaningful prior experience to fall back on. Equally significant, the submission misses the real point. Dr Goh\u2019s diagnostic process did not even meet his very own prescriptive methodology in examining patients on their mental capability, viz, interviewing persons regularly interacting with the appellant to determine if he had any impairment of social or occupational functioning at the material time.",
      "76": "Given the unsatisfactory nature of Dr Goh\u2019s assessment, it would be unsafe, in our view, to rely on his opinion that the appellant was not suffering from any form of mental illness.",
      "77": "We now turn to Dr Tan\u2019s evidence. The defence and Dr Tan cannot be faulted for the interviews taking place some ten months after the incident. It does not appear that there was any delay attributable to counsel or the appellant. The appointment processes took some time. Unlike Dr Goh, Dr Tan conducted his examination of the appellant using Hokkien as he recognised the need to establish rapport with the appellant. Dr Tan also noted the history of depression concerning Pang In, Tok May and the appellant\u2019s mother, although like Dr Goh, he was unsure of the exact nature of their mental ailments. Dr Tan\u2019s report, compared with both Dr Goh\u2019s first and second reports, contained a much more detailed account of the appellant\u2019s personal history. For example, he described the circumstances which led to the deterioration of his marriage and his subsequent divorce, such as the failed pregnancies, the opening of Xiu\u2019s massage shops, her change in dressing and their lack of communication due to their long working hours. According to the appellant, he worked long hours, as much as 15 to 17 hours on weekdays. Dr Tan also recorded the appellant\u2019s family members\u2019 descriptions of his character. According to Pang In, the appellant was quite hot-tempered but he became less so after his marriage in July 2002 at the age of 40 and he was very caring towards his family. Dr Tan further noted Pang In\u2019s and Sally\u2019s observations on the appellant\u2019s mood prior to the offence. Dr Tan\u2019s report stated:",
      "78": "In contrast, the information elucidated from the appellant\u2019s family members as recorded in Dr Goh\u2019s first report merely stated that:",
      "79": "Dr Tan\u2019s range of enquiries and diagnostic process were undoubtedly more comprehensive than Dr Goh\u2019s. The information provided by the appellant\u2019s family members would have enabled Dr Tan to have a better picture of the appellant\u2019s state of mind prior to the offence. However, Dr Tan\u2019s diagnosis also fell short of being thorough. Like Dr Goh, Dr Tan did not interview Xiu, GHK, Mr Loh or the appellant\u2019s friends. In fairness, we should mention that it would have been difficult for him (unlike Dr Goh) to have secured the assistance of Xiu (or GHK) as he was an expert for the defence. With regards to the appellant\u2019s employment history, Dr Tan\u2019s report merely recorded that he had \u201cworked for several transport companies\u201d without ascertaining the reasons for his departure from those companies. Although Dr Tan noted that the appellant has diabetes and hypertension, he did not, like Dr Goh, appear to have assessed the correlation between these medical conditions and a major depressive disorder. In addition, as noted above, both Dr Tan and Dr Goh were aware of the appellant\u2019s family history of depression but did not probe further into this. Deeper inquiries into the precise nature of their mental ailments ought to have been conducted in order to determine if they were hereditary in nature.",
      "80": "Hence, even though Dr Tan\u2019s diagnostic process was more detailed than Dr Goh\u2019s, it was not entirely satisfactory. More could and should have been done by both Dr Tan and Dr Goh (and counsel) to ensure that the trial judge was provided with detailed information of matters relevant to the appellant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the offence. This is especially important given the nature of the offence and the mandatory punishment that would follow a conviction. Bearing in mind the above concerns, we shall now analyse in greater detail Dr Tan\u2019s and Dr Goh\u2019s psychiatric diagnosis of the appellant.",
      "81": "The fundamental difference between Dr Tan\u2019s and Dr Goh\u2019s diagnosis lies in the number of symptoms listed under Criterion A of major depressive episode that was elicited from the appellant. Under the DSM-IV-TR, at least five of the nine listed symptoms must be present before a diagnosis of major depressive episode can be made. Dr Tan elicited eight symptoms from the appellant while Dr Goh could only elicit two. For ease of reference, we set out a comparison table of their findings below:",
      "82": "During the appellant\u2019s examination in chief, he affirmed various portions of his family members\u2019 accounts to Dr Tan (as recorded in Dr Tan\u2019s report):",
      "83": "The appellant also affirmed his own account as recorded in Dr Tan\u2019s report:",
      "84": "The above evidence, if unchallenged by the Prosecution, would have established, apart from Requirements (1) and (7), Requirements (3), (4), (5), (6) and (9) of Criterion A. There is an established rule of evidence that if what a witness says is not challenged, the evidence is deemed to have been admitted: the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67. The purpose of the rule is to secure procedural fairness in litigation (see Yeo Kwan Wee Kenneth v PP [2004] 2 SLR(R) 45 (at [3])). The rule requires that matters that are challenged be put to the witness during cross-examination to give the witness an opportunity to respond. Unchallenged testimony may be considered by the court to be undisputed by the opposing party and therefore accepted.",
      "85": "During the cross-examination of the appellant, the Prosecution, surprisingly, only briefly questioned a few aspects of the appellant\u2019s evidence without probing his testimony and or ultimately putting its case to the appellant. With regard to the appellant\u2019s purported weight loss, the cross-examination proceeded as follows:",
      "86": "Regrettably, there was no objective evidence produced by either party to show if and when the appellant had suffered from significant weight loss even though this fact could have been easily ascertained, in particular, by the Prosecution. While the appellant stated that he did not lose weight during the period of employment before the offence, this was contradicted by one of the Prosecution\u2019s witnesses, Mr Loh. He testified after examining a photograph taken on the day of the offence that the appellant appeared to have lost weight. Mr Loh\u2019s evidence on this point was not challenged by the Prosecution and the Prosecution did not dispute that the appellant used to weigh over 200 pounds. This underscores our concern that the appellant may not be the best person to provide information about his health. More crucially, the appellant\u2019s evidence was that he started losing weight because of the pressure from his marital problems in 2005. This point was not disputed by the Prosecution. It only asked if the appellant\u2019s weight remained constant during his period of employment with Mr Loh in 2007. Further, Oon Kim Lye, a friend of the appellant, stated that the appellant had lost \u201cquite a bit of weight after he divorced his wife\u201d. Dr Goh\u2019s evidence that the absence of significant weight loss without dieting was \u201cnot elicited\u201d from the appellant was rather remarkable. He did not ask anyone about the issue of weight loss and did not rely on any objective evidence in assessing this criterion. Accordingly, Requirement 3 of Criterion A must be taken to be established. Similarly, with regards to the appellant\u2019s reported problem of insomnia ie, Requirement 4 of Criterion A, the evidence that he was unable to sleep at night as he kept thinking of his son and about why his wife had \u201cbehaved in that way\u201d was not challenged by the Prosecution during cross-examination.",
      "87": "We note that the trial judge had found (at [51] of the judgment) that the appellant\u2019s weight loss was deliberate because of his diabetes and hypertension and that the appellant had said as much to Mr Loh. In our view, this finding is debatable considering that Mr Loh was not even aware of the actual health reason or that the appellant was diabetic. When asked specifically whether the appellant had told him the reason for his weight loss, Mr Loh could only state, \u201cEr, I think it\u2019s for health reason\u201d [emphasis added]. Further, with regard to the finding that the appellant\u2019s sleeping problem arose only after the incident based on his own account to Dr Goh, we have already pointed to the language barrier between the appellant and Dr Goh and the fact that he had conceded the possibility of miscommunication (see above at [71]). The appellant\u2019s consistent evidence was that his sleeping problem arose well before the incident.",
      "88": "In addition, the appellant verified Pang In\u2019s and Sally\u2019s observations (as recorded in Dr Tan\u2019s report) that the appellant had become very negative and was unresponsive when spoken to. He had also informed Dr Tan that he did not feel like working but had to work because he needed his job. These two nuggets of information provided the basis for Dr Tan\u2019s finding that the appellant had psychomotor retardation and was suffering from fatigue or loss of energy (Requirements 5 and 6 of Criterion A). Again, the Prosecution did not properly challenge the appellant\u2019s testimony on this point. All it asked was whether the appellant had complained to Mr Loh about his long working hours, and whether he had any problems coping with the demands of his work. Here we should pause to observe that the appellant ordinarily worked 15\u201317 hours a day on weekdays. He would certainly have been overstretched at work. Unfortunately, this aspect of his working conditions was not explored by counsel or by the psychiatrists. It is also worth noting that Pang In was a Prosecution\u2019s witness and yet the Prosecution did not consider it necessary to clarify whether what he had told Dr Tan about the appellant appearing depressed and worried as well as unresponsive when spoken to were true.",
      "89": "As for Requirement 9 of Criterion A, that is to say the appellant having suicidal thoughts, the Prosecution did briefly attempt to cross-examine him on this issue. The appellant had insisted that he had been entertaining suicidal thoughts even before the offence and that he had told Xiu that he found life to be tough-going and that he was a failure. All the Prosecution tepidly put to the appellant was that he was merely embellishing his evidence because if he had had suicidal thoughts before the offence, he would have mentioned it to Dr Goh during his examination. However, we have already explained why Dr Goh\u2019s investigative procedures were less than satisfactory. Many questions that should have been asked were not asked. Information that ought to have been obtained was not. In short, the fact that this information was not found in both of Dr Goh\u2019s reports certainly does not mean that the appellant did not have suicidal thoughts before the incident.",
      "90": "The appellant verified that even before the incident he was feeling very negative and had repeatedly told Pang In, in anguish, \u201cdie already\u201d. He had also told Pang In that he had a lot of worries and that life had no meaning. Although it was established during trial that Pang In had met the appellant only once within the period of six months preceding the offence, the Prosecution did not dispute that they often spoke to each other on the phone. If the Prosecution intended to contest the appellant\u2019s testimony on this issue, it ought to have recalled Pang In to ascertain the position. This was not done. In the circumstances, we find that Dr Tan\u2019s finding that the appellant was entertaining suicidal thoughts even prior to the incident should have been preferred by the trial judge. Accordingly, Requirement 9 of Criterion A was also satisfied.",
      "91": "Both Dr Tan and Dr Goh were of the opinion that Requirements 1 and 7 of Criterion A of a major depressive episode were displayed by the appellant. For the above reasons, we also prefer Dr Tan\u2019s opinion that Requirements 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 were also present. Since more than five of the listed requirements were present, Criterion A is satisfied. As for Criterion C, which requires impairment of social or occupational functioning, this point is related to Requirement 5 of Criterion A. Sally had observed that the appellant was sad-looking and was not lively when she met him at her daughter\u2019s birthday. Also, as stated, Pang In told Dr Tan that the appellant was unresponsive when spoken to. Both accounts were not challenged by the Prosecution. According to Dr Tan, this showed that there was a change in the appellant\u2019s behaviour and he was unable to enjoy pleasurable experiences.",
      "92": "In the circumstances, we find that Dr Tan\u2019s report, which opined that the criteria for making a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder had been satisfied, was preferable to Dr Goh\u2019s. We now turn to the non-medical evidence. The evidence (in particular, the appellant\u2019s conduct before, during and after the offence) compels us to arrive at the same conclusion.",
      "93": "Zhao Jing testified that when the appellant hit the deceased\u2019s head against the floor, he was very agitated and kept shouting \u201cWho am I\u201d. He refused to release his hands even when asked to do so by Zhao Jing (see above at [15]\u2013[16]). In his statement recorded by Sgt Chng, the appellant stated that when he was strangling the deceased, he kept on apologising to her and said that he was left with no choice but to kill her. The appellant\u2019s violence was not in keeping with his character and temperament. Xiu had testified that even when the appellant\u2019s temperament was bad, the appellant would only utter nasty words but would not resort to violence.",
      "94": "Zhao Jing had left Xiu\u2019s flat to go to the police post soon after she called Xiu to inform her of the situation. When she returned, the main gate was padlocked and the wooden door closed even though she did not lock or close them. Upon re-entry, she saw that the appellant was still sitting on the deceased even though the deceased had stopped moving. The appellant remained in the same position when she left the flat a second time and returned with the police officers. The appellant admitted during cross-examination that he had closed the main gate on both occasions but he could not explain why he did so. His actions were inexplicable; twice, he closed the main gate and wooden door and then went back to sit on the deceased. He must thus have sat on the deceased for about half an hour (from the time before Xiu made the first information report at 10.15pm to the time that the police arrived at about 10.35pm). There was no rational explanation for the appellant\u2019s behaviour.",
      "95": "One of the phone calls made by the appellant after he killed the deceased was to inform Mr Loh that he could no longer work for M/s Loh. He apologised for not being able to carry out his driving assignment the next day and told him that the key to the company\u2019s bus was at his home. It was curious why despite having committed such a serious offence, the appellant seemed unduly concerned by such an inconsequential matter. Rather than showing clarity of mind, as the trial judge seemed to have thought (see the judgment at [46]), we are of the view that this conduct was abnormal behaviour, unless he was a cold-blooded murderer; we, however, do not think he is one. This view is reinforced by the fact that the appellant was later observed to be laughing and crying when the police officers arrived at Xiu\u2019s flat. Later, he began banging his head against the wall in the temporary holding area (see above at [23]) while being interviewed.",
      "96": "The appellant\u2019s physical condition as a result of the drinking binge he had just before the incident is also an important consideration. As noted above, the appellant had a BAC of 84mg per 100ml of ethanol about three hours after the offence was committed. This is not an inconsiderable amount. Indeed, his BAC must have been much higher at the time of the offence (see http://alcoholism.about.com/cs/alerts/l/blnaa35.htm, accessed on 8 November 2010). That the effect of the alcohol could have exacerbated his depression at the time of the offence was recognised by both Dr Tan and Dr Goh. We recognise that self-induced intoxication is not a specified cause under limb (b) of the defence of diminished responsibility: see Tengku Jonaris Badlishah v PP [1999] 1 SLR(R) 800 (at [62]); Zailani bin Ahmad v PP [2005] 1 SLR(R) 356 (at [59]\u2013[61]). However, what we are concerned with is the correlation between alcohol dependence and major depressive disorder as provided by the DSM-IV-TR (see above at [44]). It is true that the appellant said in cross-examination that he was a good drinker and that his drinking habit had never previously affected his daily functions. However, we have to also consider the not unlikely possibility of a depressed patient downplaying his own symptoms. Dr Tan\u2019s report recorded that Pang In and Sally observed that the appellant had been drinking more as a result of his marital problems and that the appellant drank \u201c1 to 2 bottles of beer every night\u201d because he was depressed at being alone at home. He kept thinking of his son and had difficulty sleeping if he did not drink. This clearly revealed a serious drinking problem associated with a depressive state of mind.",
      "97": "Dr Goh\u2019s evidence on this issue in cross-examination is also revealing:",
      "98": "And:",
      "99": "Despite acknowledging that the appellant was behaving abnormally at the time of the killing, Dr Goh surprisingly maintained that the appellant suffered from no mental illness. When asked for an explanation for his abnormal behaviour, Dr Goh was unable to provide a convincing answer. While Dr Goh had quite correctly observed in his first report that:",
      "100": "(see above at [52]), he did not go on to properly analyse how the unhappy confluence of all these psycho-social pressures insidiously conspired to cause the appellant\u2019s dysfunctional conduct that night.",
      "101": "Dr Goh was plainly aware of the appellant\u2019s \u201csevere and longstanding\u201d marital problems, as well as other factors such as his family history of mental disorder and his diabetes and hypertension. He knew that the appellant had consumed a lot of alcohol and had a heated altercation with Xiu for not allowing him access to GHK just before the incident. He was even willing to accept that the appellant was behaving abnormally at the material time. The appellant\u2019s bizarre mood swings during the incident, banging the deceased\u2019s head intermittently on the floor, strangling her in the presence of a witness, laughing and crying simultaneously, apologising to the deceased while strangling her, banging his head against a wall had all been observed by Zhao Jing, Sgt Chng and SSgt Lee or documented. The phone calls to inform Mr Loh about his inability to work the next day and to inform Pang In that he was going to commit suicide by jumping from Xiu\u2019s flat and requesting Pang In to \u201ccremate [him] and throw the ashes to the sea\u201d further illustrated the abnormality of his mental state. We noted above (at [91]) that the appellant spent a long time kneeling next to or sitting on the deceased even after she had lost consciousness. When the paramedics arrived, they found the appellant still kneeling on the deceased. In addition, a photograph of the appellant taken some hours after the incident showed both his knees to be visibly red and sore. This is not an unimportant fact. Why did he spend such an inordinate amount of time kneeling on or next to the deceased even after she died?",
      "102": "Dr Goh had been informed by the appellant that his emotions were \u201cvery chaotic during [the] struggle\u201d. There was plainly objective evidence to support this assertion. Yet, Dr Goh adamantly maintained that the appellant had no mental illness at the material time. Given the unsatisfactory nature of his limited enquiries, his less than rigorous interviews with the appellant, his lack of experience in diagnosing persons charged with committing a capital crime and his failure to adequately analyse and holistically explain several aspects of the appellant\u2019s conduct that fateful night, we find Dr Goh\u2019s diagnosis of the appellant\u2019s mental condition at the material time less convincing than that of Dr Tan\u2019s.",
      "103": "Before we conclude our analysis, we ought to address a further finding of the trial judge that led him to convict the appellant of murder. He found that the several superficial incision and puncture wounds on the deceased\u2019s neck, limb and abdomen must have been inflicted by the appellant (see the judgment at [45]). The appellant had no recollection of this event and was adamant during trial that he did not touch the knife found at Xiu\u2019s flat. His fingerprints were not found on the knife or its handle. The trial judge found that it was not material whether the appellant inflicted them before or after the death of the deceased. In our view, this is a material fact. According to the pathologist, the superficiality of the wounds suggested that they were not inflicted during a struggle. The blade had been applied very lightly to the skin in a controlled manner. If this were not so, the incisions would have been deeper or less uniform. We note that counsel for the appellant, quite rightly, has not suggested that these wounds were self-inflicted. More importantly, there does not appear to have been serious blood loss as a consequence of those wounds. We therefore find that they were likely to have been inflicted after the deceased had died or lost consciousness. This further reinforces our view that the appellant was behaving abnormally at the time of the offence.",
      "104": "For all the above reasons, we find that on a balance of probabilities, the appellant has made out the defence of diminished responsibility. In the result, we set aside the conviction on the charge of murder and convict him on a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code and remit this case to the trial judge for sentencing."

      "1": "The accused, Astro bin Jakaria, is charged as follows:",
      "2": "The accused, Astro bin Jakaria (FIN No G8098952R) (\u201cthe Accused\u201d), is an East Malaysian who first came to Singapore on August 2007. He first met the deceased, Abdul Khalid bin Othman (NRIC No S2148066E) (\u201cthe Deceased\u201d), sometime in September 2007 while working as a cleaner for Sengent Company. The Accused referred to the Deceased as \u201cKak Mie\u201d and knew that the Deceased was a transvestite. In the course of the following one month, their relationship developed rapidly and they became closer.",
      "3": "In October 2007, due to poor job performance, Sengent Company terminated the Accused\u2019s employment. The Accused requested for the Deceased\u2019s assistance as he no longer had a place to stay. This led to the Deceased inviting the Accused to stay with him at his flat. Thereafter, the Accused resided at the Deceased\u2019s flat until he left for Malaysia on 6 November 2007.",
      "4": "The Accused returned to Singapore on several occasions and on each visit, he stayed at the Deceased\u2019s flat until his return to Malaysia. The Accused\u2019s passport (D4) showed that he had entered Singapore on 14 December 2007 and exited on 19 December 2007. He re-entered Singapore on 24 December 2007 and left on 29 December 2007.",
      "5": "On 9 January 2008, the Accused again returned to Singapore and visited the Deceased at his flat. The Deceased recommended a factory job in Tampines which was taken up by the Accused. Afterwhich, the Accused stayed at the company\u2019s accommodation until he left Singapore on 24 February 2008. This was the only period of time the Accused was employed in Singapore after his termination by Sengent Company.",
      "6": "For the duration of each stay in Singapore, the Accused had never contributed to the rent of the Deceased\u2019s flat. In other words, the Deceased provided free lodging to the Accused whenever the latter was in Singapore.",
      "7": "It was evident that the Deceased was deeply caring towards the Accused. Apart from providing him with shelter, the Deceased\u2019s generosity extended to buying him new clothes, cooking him meals and giving him money when he was short of it (and this was usually the case given the Accused\u2019s unemployment).",
      "8": "The Deceased lived in a one bedroom HDB flat. His flatmates, one Taher bin Ahmad and one Kak Timah, slept in the living room/hall of the flat. The Accused slept in the Deceased\u2019s bedroom and shared the same bed with the Deceased during his stay.",
      "9": "It was the Accused\u2019s evidence that from the first night he started sharing the bed with the Deceased, the latter would touch and caress him to arouse his sexual desires. The Accused, prior to 19 June 2008, had always warded off his sexual advances.",
      "10": "The Accused returned to Singapore again on Sunday 15 June 2008 and stayed at the Deceased\u2019s flat.",
      "11": "At about 6.00pm on 19 June 2008, the Accused met the Deceased at the latter\u2019s workplace at the SMRT Clubhouse. The Accused was told to wait until the Deceased was done with work. While waiting in the store room, the Accused drank one whole bottle of Royal Stout and one third of a bottle of Carlsberg.",
      "12": "At about 8.26pm, the Deceased and the Accused left for the Deceased\u2019s flat. They reached the flat at about 9.00pm, after which, the Deceased gave the Accused $20 to buy some drinks. The Accused then proceeded to a nearby coffee shop and bought a bottle of Carlsberg (P234) and a bottle of Guinness Stout (P235).",
      "13": "The Accused returned to the flat at about 9.05pm to 9.10pm. When he reached the flat, he saw the Deceased clad in a red towel and was applying lotion to his thighs and hands. The Accused then placed the drinks he purchased aside and sat on the bed.",
      "14": "The Deceased got up and sat next to the Accused. He started to caress the Accused\u2019s hands and thighs and attempted to touch his penis. The Accused pushed the Deceased\u2019s hand away and told him \u201cNanti\u201d, which means \u201cwait\u201d in Malay.",
      "15": "The Accused then requested for a bottle opener and a glass on two separate occasions. The Deceased obliged and went back and forth twice to get the requested items from the kitchen. After opening and pouring his drink into the glass, the Accused placed the glass on the floor and then removed his T-shirt as he felt warm.",
      "16": "The Deceased left the room again and brought back a bottle of Drambuie (a type of whisky liquor) (P236). The Accused declined the Deceased\u2019s offer to have the liquor as it was too strong for him. The Deceased then took a sip of the said liquor and sat beside the Accused. The Accused drank the whole bottle of Guinness Stout (P235).",
      "17": "The Accused then put on a concert CD into the VCD player. The Deceased, within a few minutes, changed the concert CD to a \u201cblue\u201d VCD which showed man-on-man pornography and proceeded to fondle the Accused. He removed the Accused\u2019s jeans, pulled down his boxers and started performing fellatio on the Accused. All the while, the Accused lay on his back and imagined that it was a woman who was performing fellatio on him. He became sexually aroused and sustained an erection.",
      "18": "The Deceased then stopped. The Accused then realised that the Deceased was sitting next to him. When the Accused asked \u201cWhy?\u201d, the Deceased propositioned to him and said, \u201cCome play my backside\u201d. The Accused flatly declined, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want, I\u2019m not used to this\u201d and pulled up his boxers. He then went to take his pair of jeans that was hung behind the bedroom door.",
      "19": "The Deceased tried to cajole the Accused. He also mentioned that he had given the Accused what he wanted and provided him with lodging. As he started caressing the Accused, the Accused pushed him and he fell backwards into the cupboard and let out a scream. As the Deceased tried to stand up, the Accused saw the Deceased gripping something in his hand and was looking angrily at him.",
      "20": "The Accused then punched the Deceased\u2019s face. The Deceased fell again and covered his face with his hand while mumbling something and trying to stand up. The Accused pounced on him again and gripped the Deceased from the back of his neck. The Deceased\u2019s head was positioned under the Accused\u2019s right armpit and the Deceased was then pushed onto the bed.",
      "21": "The Accused went up on to the bed, held the Deceased\u2019s right shoulder, crossed over the Deceased\u2019s body and positioned himself to the right side of the Deceased. He gripped the Deceased\u2019s neck using his left arm and punched the Deceased again. His grip was released as the Deceased was struggling. The Deceased then used his right elbow to strike the Accused\u2019s chest region while struggling at the same time. The Accused fell backwards and tried to grab hold of the Deceased. The Deceased scratched the Accused\u2019s left cheek, left arm and left hand.",
      "22": "The Accused then punched the Deceased\u2019s chest. The Deceased fell backwards onto the mattress. He tried to sit up and the Accused pushed the Deceased again causing him to fall on the floor beside the bed with one foot on the bed. The Deceased groaned in pain.",
      "23": "During the course of the scuffle, the Deceased let out a shriek which alerted his neighbours, one Madam Sua Joo Eng (PW13) and one Madam Sarah bte Aman (PW21). The Deceased\u2019s denture was also dislodged from his mouth at some point of the scuffle. The Accused, in his attempt to prevent the Deceased from calling the police, grabbed a long-sleeved brown striped T-shirt and tied up the Deceased. The details of how this was done and how it caused the Deceased\u2019s death will be dealt with below.",
      "24": "After tying up and immobilising the Deceased, the Accused removed the Deceased\u2019s gold bracelet (P154) from his wrist, took his own jacket (P243), and placed it into a black sling bag (P242). He then gathered the clutter of clothes that had been strewn on the floor in the course of the scuffle and hurriedly placed them into the wardrobe. While doing so, the Accused found a gold chain (P162) belonging to the Deceased and took it. He also appropriated the Deceased\u2019s handphone (P146).",
      "25": "As the Accused exited the bedroom, he switched off the lights and locked the bedroom door by pressing the lock and shutting the door behind him. He later hailed a cab and went to Geylang. There, he checked into Hotel 12 Pte Ltd under the name of one Lawrence Anak Nyuak and stayed there from 19 June 2008 until the time of his arrest. All the while, the Accused had his passport in his possession.",
      "26": "After being told by the Deceased\u2019s flatmate Taher bin Ahmad (\u201cTaher\u201d) (PW26) that the Deceased was not seen inside the flat since 19 June 2008 and being informed by the Deceased\u2019s sister, one Norita bte Abdul Latiff that the Deceased was not contactable on 20 June 2008, the Deceased\u2019s adopted daughter, Aini bte Karim (\u201cAini\u201d) (PW29) made several attempts to contact the Deceased by calling his mobile phone and residential number.",
      "27": "On 21 June 2008 at around 2.00pm, Aini decided to lodge a missing person report with the police. Her boyfriend, Ishak bin Mohamed (\u201cIshak\u201d) (PW24) however suggested that they should first inspect the Deceased\u2019s flat before lodging the report.",
      "28": "At about 5.45pm, Aini and Ishak arrived at the Deceased\u2019s flat and let themselves in using Taher\u2019s keys. As Taher had earlier informed them that he did not have the keys to the Deceased\u2019s bedroom door, they brought along with them two screwdrivers. Ishak then unsuccessfully tried to pry open the Deceased\u2019s bedroom door using the two screwdrivers, a chopper and a pair of scissors which were found in the Deceased\u2019s kitchen. After his failed attempts, he decided to force his way in by kicking down the bedroom door.",
      "29": "Upon entering the bedroom, Aini switched on the lights. Ishak spotted a blue bag (P233) on the floor. He placed it on the bed and checked the contents of the said bag. The bag contained a silver metal box (P231), a black box (P232) with a \u201cHeineken\u201d watch inside and some male garments.",
      "30": "Aini, on the other hand, opened the Deceased\u2019s wardrobe and found that it was in a state of disarray. This was unusual as the Deceased\u2019s clothing were normally hung neatly inside the wardrobe. The metal rod which was used to hang the Deceased\u2019s clothing had fallen off and a pile of clothing was cluttered up at the base of the wardrobe.",
      "31": "Aini then looked around the Deceased\u2019s bedroom and caught a glimpse of a portion of hair on the floor next to the bed. She immediately pointed it out to Ishak and asked if that was the Deceased. Aini became hysterical and Ishak quickly brought her to the corridor to calm her down.",
      "32": "Ishak then returned to the Deceased\u2019s bedroom. He removed a red blanket (P199) and a small yellow cushion (P200) and found a human body lying face-down. Ishak placed the items he had removed back to their respective positions and swiftly exited the Deceased\u2019s bedroom. He called the police at about 6.15pm.",
      "33": "Staff Sergeant Mohammad Ridzwan bin Taib (\u201cSSgt Ridzwan\u201d) (PW12) and Corporal Ryan Lim Chong Jen (\u201cCpl Lim\u201d) (PW15) were dispatched to the Deceased\u2019s flat. Ishak led SSgt Ridzwan and Cpl Lim to the Deceased\u2019s bedroom. Ishak removed the same items, which he had removed earlier, that were on top of the body. SSgt Ridzwan and Cpl Lim then saw a body, clad in a brassiere, lying motionless in a prone position. They observed that both of the Deceased\u2019s hands were tied to his back with a long-sleeved brown striped T-shirt. Ishak then replaced the items in the same order as he had found them.",
      "34": "As foul play was suspected, SSgt Ridzwan instructed Ishak and Cpl Lim to leave the flat to prevent the contamination of the scene. He then contacted duty Senior Investigation Officer, Station Inspector Goh Tia Eng (PW17) and informed him of their findings. The scene was immediately cordoned off.",
      "35": "Sergeant Mohamed Nasir bin Mohaideen Arabi Noordin (\u201cSgt Nasir\u201d) (PW16), a paramedic, arrived at the Deceased\u2019s flat at about 6.25pm. As a long-sleeved brown striped T-shirt was tied around the circumference of the Deceased\u2019s neck, Sgt Nasir was unable to take the carotid pulse and had to look for an arterial pulse from the Deceased\u2019s hands instead. Sgt Nasir removed some of the materials covering the Deceased\u2019s lower body which exposed the Deceased\u2019s hands, bound together by the said T-shirt, and took the Deceased\u2019s pulse. No pulse was detected and the Deceased was pronounced dead at 6.30pm.",
      "36": "At about 10.00pm, Assoc Prof Gilbert Lau (\u201cA/P Gilbert Lau\u201d), (PW25) a Senior Consultant Forensic Pathologist attached to the Centre for Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d), arrived at the flat and proceeded to examine the scene. At about 11.05pm, he conducted an external examination of the Deceased\u2019s body at the scene. The estimated post-mortem interval was pronounced to be within the region of 1\u20132 days.",
      "37": "On 22 June 2008 at about 9.45am, the Accused was arrested at Hotel 12 Pte Ltd by Senior Station Inspector Zainal Abidin Ismail (\u201cSSI Zainal Abidin\u201d) (PW33), Assistant Superintendent Christopher Jacob (PW18) and some other officers. After his arrest, the Accused gave the following statements to the police:",
      "38": "It was the Prosecution\u2019s case that during the scuffle, the Accused used a long-sleeved brown striped T-shirt and tied it around the Deceased\u2019s neck. In doing so, the Accused had committed murder by way of strangulation and was therefore liable for the offence under s 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) which stipulates that:",
      "39": "The Prosecution submitted that it had discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had committed the offence of murder under s 300(c) of the Penal Code:",
      "40": "The Prosecution based their case, inter alia, on:",
      "41": "A/P Gilbert Lau conducted the autopsy on the Deceased and testified that the cause of death was strangulation by ligature. He observed that the ligature was a long-sleeved, crew neck T-shirt that was applied circumferentially to the Deceased\u2019s neck in a single loop and was secured by a partial slip knot tightly applied at the back of the neck.",
      "42": "It was found that the ligature was tightly constricting:",
      "43": "A/P Gilbert Lau testified that the severe force that had caused such structural damage would certainly have closed off the airways and blood vessels around the Deceased\u2019s neck completely, thus depriving the Deceased\u2019s brain, heart and vital organs of oxygen. He opined that strangulation by ligature of this nature was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.",
      "44": "Dr Leong Hsiao Tung (\u201cDr Leong\u201d) (PW5) prepared the Toxicology Report (P132) in which it was found that, inter alia, the concentration of ethanol in the Deceased\u2019s blood was 9mg/100ml. Dr Leong\u2019s evidence was that the amount of ethanol was not significant and was likely a result of consumption of alcohol before death or post-mortem production of ethanol. Based on this post-mortem toxicology report, A/P Gilbert Lau was able to rule out the possibility that the Deceased might have been in some way incapacitated before he was set upon by the assailant. This finding combined with the absence of typical defensive injuries on the Deceased\u2019s body suggested that the Deceased was taken by surprise or overpowered very quickly by the assailant.",
      "45": "The following HSA Reports confirm that there was contact transfer between the Deceased and the Accused.",
      "46": "Dr Christopher K C Syn (\u201cDr Syn\u201d) (PW11), a forensic scientist, gave evidence based on his Laboratory Report DN-2008-00755 (P133) that the DNA of the Accused was found on the nail clippings (P225) of the Deceased marked \u201cL1\u201d to \u201cL5\u201d and \u201cR5\u201d. The Accused\u2019s blood was also detected (albeit of trace amount) on the said nail clippings marked \u201cR5\u201d and \u201cL4\u201d.",
      "47": "Ms Kee Koh Kheng (\u201cMs Kee\u201d) (PW28), a Forensic Scientist attached to the Forensic Science Division of the HSA, compiled the Laboratory Report No CR-2008-00119 (P137) which revealed the following findings:",
      "48": "Thus, the HSA Reports read with A/P Gilbert Lau\u2019s evidence show that the Accused was the person present at the scene and was the one who had applied the ligature onto the Deceased. The Defence does not dispute this.",
      "49": "The Prosecution maintained that the Accused was sober when he committed the alleged offence in the sense that he was not so intoxicated that he was not aware of what he was doing or that what he was doing was wrong. The Accused was also not so intoxicated that he could not have formed the necessary intention to cause bodily injury to the Deceased.",
      "50": "The Defence conceded this point and did not rely on the defences of ss 85(2)(b) or 86(2) of the Penal Code, ie, insane intoxication and intoxication negating intention respectively. In other words, the Defence conceded that the Accused had the intention of applying and tying up the ligature on the Deceased. The main issue which divides the Prosecution and Defence is: where the Accused intended to apply and tie the ligature.",
      "51": "The fatal injury in this case was strangulation caused by the ligature found on the Deceased\u2019s neck. Considerable force was used in tying the ligature such that acute compression led to the fracture of the laryngeal structures located in the neck.",
      "52": "A/P Gilbert Lau\u2019s evidence was that the said injury was sufficient, in the normal course of nature, to cause death. He was able to comment, with reasonable confidence, that the application of a ligature of this nature would in all likelihood caused the Deceased to have lost consciousness within a matter of seconds and death would have taken place in a matter of minutes.",
      "53": "The Prosecution submitted that: the tying of ligature was not unintentional; the tying of the partial knot was not unintentional; the winding of the remaining part of the T-shirt around the Deceased\u2019s forearms and wrists was not unintentional.",
      "54": "Three possible scenarios as to what might have happened on the night of 19 June 2008 were presented to the court:",
      "55": "It was the Prosecution\u2019s case that the Accused had knowingly tied the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck, thereby suggesting that the Accused\u2019s evidence that he only intended to tie the Deceased\u2019s mouth and that he might have accidentally tied it around the Deceased\u2019s neck was untrue. The Prosecution found it pertinent to note that when A/P Gilbert Lau was being cross-examined by the Defence, the Defence had adopted possibility (b). It was only after A/P Gilbert Lau raised the possibility of scenario (c) that the Defence sought to build their case on it.",
      "56": "The Prosecution also submitted that the Accused\u2019s inconsistent statements (those recorded during investigative stages and those made in court) formed the bulk of lies which were conjured in order to exculpate himself and escape the death penalty.",
      "57": "Given the inherent inconsistencies of the Accused\u2019s statements, it was thus the Prosecution\u2019s position that the Accused\u2019s statements should be disregarded, and the court should therefore base its decision on the evidence of A/P Gilbert Lau and the objective evidence presented before the court. On such a basis, the Prosecution submitted that it has discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had committed murder under s 300(c) of the Penal Code against the Deceased.",
      "58": "It was the Defence\u2019s case that:",
      "59": "During cross-examination, defence counsel suggested to A/P Gilbert Lau a possible scenario of the tightening of ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck: that the Deceased had in the course of struggling, suffered the misfortune of killing himself by tightening the ligature (initially applied around the mouth) that had slipped around his neck.",
      "60": "A/P Gilbert Lau rejected Counsel\u2019s suggestion, reasoning that:",
      "61": "The suggestion that the Accused saw the Deceased shaking and frothing at the mouth when the latter had fallen backwards and hit himself against the wardrobe in the course of the scuffle was also refuted by A/P Gilbert Lau. He opined that the Deceased did not suffer from any natural disease that could have accounted for such a reaction. Furthermore, such reaction could not have come from a person suffering from a mild state of shock.",
      "62": "A/P Gilbert Lau, however, opined that he would not dispel the possibility that the Accused might have thought that he had applied the ligature to the mouth with the intention of applying a gag, when it had actually been applied to the neck instead.",
      "63": "The Defence submitted that the Accused did not have the intention to tie the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck. The following statements recorded from the Accused supported this position:",
      "64": "The locus classicus of s 300(c) of the Penal Code is the decision of the Indian Supreme Court in Virsa Singh v State of Punjab AIR (45) 1958 SC 465 (\u201cVirsa Singh\u201d) where it was held at [12] that four elements must be proved to establish murder under s 300(c):",
      "65": "In further explaining the third element, which is the element in dispute in the present case, Bose J at [16] held that:",
      "66": "In the case of PP v Lim Poh Lye [2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (\u201cLim Poh Lye\u201d) the accused was found to have intended to stab the victim\u2019s thigh to prevent him from struggling and escaping. Although it was true that the fatal stab wound was caused to a body part which was not commonly known to be a vulnerable region of the body, that was not a consideration that affected the operation of s 300(c). The crucial question to ask is whether the wounds that were caused were in fact wounds which the accused intended to cause. As the court in Tan Chee Wee v PP [2004] 1 SLR(R) 479 (\u201cTan Chee Wee\u201d) at [42] stated:",
      "67": "The Defence rigorously sought to demonstrate that the Accused did not have the intention to cause the injury which caused the death of the Deceased, ie, his intention was to tie the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s mouth and such a tying over the mouth does not, in the ordinary course of nature, cause death. Hence, the Defence\u2019s position was that the applying and tightening of ligature around the neck was accidental or unintentional.",
      "68": "Chao Hick Tin JA at [22] of Lim Poh Lye, emphasised that the third limb of Virsa Singh ([64] supra), ie, whether a particular injury was accidental or unintended is a question of fact which has to be determined by the court in light of the evidence adduced and taking into account all the surrounding circumstances of the case. If the court should at the end of the day find that the accused only intended to cause a particular \u201cminor injury\u201d, to use the term of the court in Tan Joo Cheng v PP [1992] 1 SLR(R) 219, which injury would not, in the normal course of nature, cause death, but in fact caused a different injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, s 300(c) would not be attracted. Thus, it is incumbent upon this court to decide on the totality of the evidence having regard to all the surrounding circumstances, whether the requisite intention in s 300(c) had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt by the Prosecution.",
      "69": "Notably, the Prosecution strongly urged the court to disregard the Accused\u2019s statements.",
      "70": "In relation to the mixed statements of an accused containing incriminating as well as exculpatory parts, the decision of Tan Chee Hwee v PP [1993] 2 SLR(R) 493 (\u201cTan Chee Hwee\u201d) is instructive: the court had to approach the incriminating portion with the exculpatory or explanatory parts of the accused\u2019s statements together with all the surrounding circumstances to decide where the truth lay.",
      "71": "The Accused was depicted by the Prosecution as a conniving liar who was capable of lying unabashedly even in the face of a statutory warning. His ability to breathe life into two wholly fictitious, non-existent characters (ie, Zulkarnian and Khairul) and to vividly recount a robbery (filled with titillating details from its conception to execution) that had never taken place were tell-tale signs of a master of fabrication. In his first investigation statement (D3) and cautioned statement (P144), Zulkarnian and Khairul were seen as the masterminds behind the plot whereas he was just an accessory, a mere passive look-out. He then confessed to SSI Zainal Abidin that he had lied to relieve himself from shouldering the burden or responsibility of having caused the death of the Deceased.",
      "72": "With regard to the Accused\u2019s other statements, ie, P159, P160 and P161, the Prosecution submitted that these were mixed statements. Although the Accused, at this juncture, admitted to being the sole assailant, he had however sought to exonerate himself by claiming that he had merely tied the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s mouth and not the neck. The Accused also stressed in court, numerous times, that the Deceased was still alive when he left the bedroom.",
      "73": "Furthermore, the Accused, during his examination-in-chief had adopted different stances as to what happened during the act of tying up the Deceased:",
      "74": "The Accused\u2019s constant change in stance before the court was, according to the Prosecution, a clear illustration of how he would subtly tailor his evidence in order to convince the court that he did not kill the Deceased as he \u201cintended to only cover the Deceased\u2019s mouth\u201d.",
      "75": "The Prosecution\u2019s impeachment of the Accused\u2019s credibility and veracity was based on the fact that all his lies, from the start of investigation to the proceedings in court, pertained to one of the most crucial aspects of the case: how did the Accused apply the ligature on the Deceased. Was it merely coincidental that the Accused had, throughout the case, conveniently invented characters and varied his statements as to how and where the ligature was applied at the most critical junctures?",
      "76": "The Prosecution submitted that it was trite law that lies could be corroborative of guilt. Adverse inference should be drawn against the Accused as warranted under s 123 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) in respect of his lie in his s 122(6) cautioned statement (P144). Thus, the court should not accept the Accused\u2019s defence that he had only intended to tie the Deceased\u2019s mouth and not the neck.",
      "77": "The Defence, on the other hand, proffered some explanations for the Accused\u2019s reason for lying and giving inconsistent statements:",
      "78": "Although SSI Zainal Abidin was under the impression that the Accused knew that the Deceased had died when he was being interviewed and D3 was being recorded, the Defence, however, maintained its stance that upon arrest, the Accused thought that it was in relation to the theft of the Deceased\u2019s jewellery. Therefore when he was informed of the death, it was natural that he was very shocked.",
      "79": "Furthermore, the Defence also submitted that the Accused was not someone who had plotted the whole story over a period of time in order to lie to the police as there was only a 3-day interval between the Deceased\u2019s death and the Accused\u2019s arrest. His emotions on hearing the news of the death led to his imagination taking control over him.",
      "80": "As to why the Accused lied twice in a day, his explanation was that he was very frightened when the first statement (D3) and cautioned statement (P144) were taken. The Accused later decided to come clean and relate the true story to Inspector Kwok after SSI Zainal Abidin told him that he did not believe in his story about Zulkarnian and Khairul.",
      "81": "The Defence submitted that the Accused was forthcoming during his examination-in-chief in which he admitted to his own lies. Moreover, the Accused furnished a plausible explanation as to why he had lied: he had never had any run in with the law prior to this case and therefore, it must have been alarming and shocking for him to be apprehended for such a serious and grave offence. The Accused had lied under those circumstances as he was in a state of shock, despair and confusion, causing him to be \u201cnot in a proper state of mind\u201d.",
      "82": "The Court of Criminal Appeal in Chan Kin Choi v PP [1991] 1 SLR(R) 111 (\u201cChan Kin Choi\u201d) held that once the defence was called (as it was in this case), the trial judges who were performing the role of deciders of fact must consider the whole statement, both the incriminating parts and excuses or explanations, in deciding where the truth lay. Thus, this court should consider the incriminating portion of the Accused\u2019s statements and the lies, having regard to the exculpatory or explanatory parts of his statements, his evidence in court and all the surrounding circumstances in its endeavour to determine what the true facts are.",
      "83": "In the case of Tan Chee Hwee v PP ([70] supra), there were inconsistencies between the appellants\u2019 police statements and their evidence in court. Tan, the first appellant, had in his police statement stated that he and Soon (the second appellant) had strangled the maid with the cord of an electric iron as opposed to using his bare hands. His explanation for the discrepancy was that at the time he gave the confession statement, his grandfather had passed away and he was confused. In his oral evidence, Tan also admitted that some parts of his statements to the police were lies.",
      "84": "As for the second appellant, he admitted during cross-examination that his statements to the police made no mention of Tan rendering the maid unconscious with his bare hands because he was scared, confused and disorientated at the time of interrogation. Soon maintained throughout his evidence that his intention that day was to \u201ctake the money\u201d and that he had no intention whatsoever of killing the maid. He also admitted to lying to the police when he had said that he only learnt of the maid\u2019s death from the newspapers the next morning.",
      "85": "Karthigesu J at [46] noted that far from being overwhelming, it would be totally unsafe (as the judicial commissioner below had done) to disregard the s 122(6) statement of Tan as well as the explanation given in his long statement and conclude that, when Tan with the help of Soon placed the cord of the electric iron around the body of the violently struggling maid, it was not to tie her up around the waist but to strangle her with it around the neck.",
      "86": "Karthigesu J opined that taken as a whole and giving such weight to the exculpatory portions of the statements, short of disregarding them altogether, the evidence was equally consistent with an intention to tie the maid up without any intention of causing her bodily injury. The fact that the first appellant did not hit the maid with the iron and instead used it to tie her up strongly suggested that even at the critical moment the first appellant could not have formed an intention to strangle the maid with the cord of the electric iron as a means of silencing her forever. In those circumstances, the court in Tan Chee Hwee was driven to conclude that the injury which was in fact caused to the maid around her neck, in all probability, was not intentionally but accidentally or unintentionally caused. See [46].",
      "87": "I note that in the application of the Virsa Singh test to the factual matrix of the present case, there are no difficulties in meeting the requirements of the first, second and fourth limb of the said test. The third test, being as contentious and vexing as it is, forms the critical dividing point between the Prosecution and the Defence. In order to determine whether the Accused had intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck, it would be prudent to assess all the Accused\u2019s statements, both incriminating and exculpatory, and his oral evidence in court together with the objective evidence.",
      "88": "The forensic evidence, especially those provided by A/P Gilbert Lau, can offer only so much assistance as to establish the degree of force used in applying the ligature, the internal injuries caused and whether they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Although A/P Gilbert Lau was not in a position to assist on the question of the intention of the Accused at the time the ligature was applied, he nevertheless said that he would not rule out that the Accused might have mistakenly applied the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck when he had only intended to tie up the Deceased\u2019s mouth. At this point, it must be emphasised that it was very clear from the evidence (in particular from the position of the knot being at the back of the Deceased\u2019s neck) that when the Accused applied the ligature, the Accused was positioned at the back of the Deceased, who was lying face down on the floor. It was not as if the Accused was lying with his face upwards when the Accused was tying the knot and the Accused could obviously see that he was not applying the ligature to the mouth but to the neck.",
      "89": "The Accused had, at several junctures, repeated that he had no intention to kill the Deceased and that when he left the flat, the Deceased was still alive (or so he thought). He also later admitted in his statement and in court that he had invented two fictional characters when he was interrogated because he was in a state of shock, fear and confusion. As contemplated by MPH Rubin J in PP v Sundarti Supriyanto [2004] 4 SLR(R) 622 at [144], to hold the falsified statements or lies out of court against the accused to corroborate his guilt or to discredit him as a witness would mean disregarding perfectly acceptable portions of his testimony in court. This would be a disproportionate reaction, especially in a trial where capital punishment was involved.",
      "90": "It is also poignant to note that there are evidential gaps in the Prosecution\u2019s case. The Prosecution is faced with the daunting task of proving that the Accused in fact had the intention to apply the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck. That the ligature eventually ended up around the Deceased\u2019s neck was supported by forensic evidence and that the Accused was the only person present at the scene was never disputed. However, the specific intent of the Accused in so applying and tying the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck and not the mouth must still be proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "91": "I find it compelling to note that the Deceased, when he exited the Deceased\u2019s flat on the night of 19 June 2008, had left his blue canvas bag behind. If the Prosecution was correct in describing the Accused as a careful and meticulous murderer, his act of forgetting his blue bag would have been a devastating miscalculation on his part. If the Accused had intentionally tied the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck thereby causing his death, it would be odd to find that having taken the Deceased\u2019s jewellery to ensure that he would be financially secured for at least the next few days (if not weeks) thus giving him sufficient time to make his escape possibly out of Singapore, the Accused would be so perplexingly careless as to leave his belongings as a voluntary lead for police investigations to track him down. Leaving the bag behind also showed to some extent that he intended to return to the flat, which lends some weight to his evidence that he did not know at the time he left the flat that the Deceased had died. If he knew the Deceased had died, he probably would not have left his blue canvas bag behind.",
      "92": "Moreover, the act of pawning the Deceased\u2019s gold bracelet (P154) at Tekka Enterprises on 20 June 2008 at around 10.30am using the Deceased\u2019s identity card further lends credence to the Accused\u2019s evidence that he did not know that the Deceased had passed away until he was informed by SSI Zainal Abidin. If the Prosecution was right that the Accused had intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck and had thereby caused his death, it would be an act which baffles and defies common sense to use the Deceased\u2019s identity card for transactional or even any purpose at all. The Prosecution emphasised that the Accused was no simpleton and was wary not to use his passport to register for a room in Hotel 12, possibly for the avoidance of police detection. If this were the logic that had occupied the Accused\u2019s mind after he left the Deceased\u2019s flat, would it not be contradictory and futile to his efforts of self-preservation to use the Deceased\u2019s identity card which would expose himself, sooner or later, to the authorities?",
      "93": "The Accused also had in his possession his Malaysian passport throughout the period when he left the Deceased\u2019s flat up until his arrest. After he had pawned the Deceased\u2019s gold bracelet (P154) raising a sum of $1,900, would it not have been the most prudent decision to leave Singapore immediately and escape the accompanying death penalty once and for all? His actions of lingering around the streets of Singapore, from pawning a gold chain with a key-shaped pendant (P167) for $150 at Tekka Enterprises, to later engaging the services of a prostitute on the 21 June 2008, showed no intention to flee the country or even cover up his trail and are therefore at odds with the Prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "94": "I now consider whether the Accused had intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck to strangle him in order to rob the Deceased of the jewelleries that the he was wearing at that time. Although motive is not to be equated with mens rea per se, motive can be a helpful instrument in pointing us to the right direction as to whether the requisite mens rea for the offence was in fact present. In my view, a motive of robbery on the Accused\u2019s part would be highly unlikely. Given that the Deceased had always been obliging in respect of the Accused\u2019s needs and requests for money, a fact substantiated by the evidence given by Taher and the Accused himself, the Accused could have just asked for more money from the Deceased rather than murder the Deceased in order to steal his gold bracelet, gold chain and hand phone.",
      "95": "It was held in Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [61] that while the Prosecution does not have to dispel all conceivable doubts, the doctrine that the Prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt mandates that, at the very least, those doubts for which there is a reason that is relatable to and supported by the evidence presented must be excluded so that no reasonable doubt remains. I am of view that the doubts raised above are not merely fanciful doubts but those which are reasonable. The lack of an \u201cunbreakable and credible chain of evidence\u201d (in the words of XP v PP [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at [98]) seem to indicate that there are decidedly reasonable doubts concerning the Accused\u2019s intention in inflicting the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck in order to strangle the Deceased to death.",
      "96": "Thus, following the approach in Chan Kin Choi ([81] supra) and Tan Chee Hwee ([70] supra), it would be prudent to take into account both incriminating and exculpating statements of the Accused, assigning them with appropriate weights as such, short of disregarding the exculpating/explanatory portions altogether. The Accused\u2019s explanation that he did not intend to tie the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck and that he was of the belief that the Deceased was still alive seem to be, on balance of probabilities, truthful as it is corroborated by objective circumstantial evidence in the aforementioned [90] to [93]. In any case, at the very least I am of the view that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the Accused had in fact intended to apply the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck. I therefore find that the Prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of tying the ligature around the Deceased\u2019s neck was one that was intentional and not accidental. Accordingly, the Accused is not guilty of murder under s 300(c) of the Penal Code.",
      "97": "The Accused, however, at the point of application of the ligature, must have known that his act of tying the knot at the back of the Deceased\u2019s head and tightening the ligature was likely to cause death given the proximity between the mouth and neck region. This inherent risk was elevated by the fact that the Deceased was lying face down. As the Deceased was in a prone position and was struggling when the ligature was applied, the Accused was not given a clear view of the exact position of the ligature beneath, ie, whether it was at the mouth, chin or neck area, at the time he tightened the ligature with a considerable amount of force whilst he was positioned at the back of the Deceased. As this was the case, the Accused is therefore guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 299 and is therefore punishable under s 304(b) of the Penal Code:",
      "98": "Even if murder under s 300(c) were to be successfully proven by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, this court finds that the defence of provocation is made out on the evidence and the offence of murder must in any event be reduced to one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 299 of the Penal Code.",
      "99": "The relationship between the Deceased and the Accused becomes critical in determining whether the defence of provocation would operate in this present case. If they were in fact lovers to the extent that the Accused had been regularly penetrating the anus of the Deceased, then perhaps I may not regard the alleged provocation, ie, the proposition for anal intercourse, as grave and sudden under the circumstances. It may not even amount to a provocation at all.",
      "100": "The Prosecution maintained that the Accused and Deceased were in fact lovers. This was based on the oral testimonies of the Prosecution\u2019s witnesses Taher, Aini and one Mr Seet Seng Hai (\u201cMr Seet\u201d) (PW20). However, the extent of their sexual relationship prior to the incident, in particular whether it included anal sex, was not clear from the evidence relied on by the Prosecution.",
      "101": "Taher had known the Deceased since 1978 and lived together since 1986. Their relationship was platonic and they were like siblings. It was Taher\u2019s evidence that the Deceased and the Accused were lovers. In fact, he himself was against their relationship as he suspected that the Accused was financially draining the Deceased. His conclusion that the two were lovers was based on the following observations:",
      "102": "Mr Seet, on the other hand, was the Deceased\u2019s supervisor/employer at Sengent Company. During cross-examination, Mr Seet was asked whether the \u201clover\u201d mentioned by the Deceased was in fact the Accused or possibly someone else. Mr Seet\u2019s reply was the Deceased had told him that the lover was his \u201cEast Malaysian former employee\u201d. In addition to that, the name \u201cAstro\u201d was also mentioned.",
      "103": "The Defence, on the other hand, denied any romantic relationship between the Deceased and the Accused. Instead, their relationship was akin to mother and son. The Accused had always felt beholden to the Deceased and described the Deceased as his \u201cadopted family\u201d in Singapore.",
      "104": "With regard to the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses that the Deceased and Accused were lovers, the Defence submitted that some Prosecution witnesses, especially Taher, lacked credibility. The Defence disputed Taher\u2019s observations as mere personal assumptions. His dislike towards the Accused stemmed from his belief that the latter was taking advantage of the Deceased from the very moment the Deceased met the Accused.",
      "105": "Most significantly, Taher\u2019s evidence on the physical intimacy between the Deceased and Accused was inconsistent. In his evidence, Taher first said that he had never seen them kissing or holding hands and admitted that it was his assumption that they were lovers. However, in the latter part of his evidence, he then testified that he had witnessed them holding hands and leaning against the railing near the MRT station.",
      "106": "The Defence relied on the close-circuit television (\u201cCCTV\u201d) footage taken outside the SMRT Clubhouse (P156) which showed the Deceased and Accused leaving the premises of the clubhouse together. Notably, they were not walking next to each other. There was, in fact, quite a clear distance between them. The interaction between the two as captured by the CCTV suggested that the Deceased and the Accused were just friends and not lovers. This was also corroborated by the evidence of Sarah bte Aman who had seen the two walking near the car park of their HDB flat and that their interaction seemed \u201cnormal\u201d without any exchange of romantic gestures.",
      "107": "Aini\u2019s evidence in relation to the Accused being the Deceased\u2019s lover was speculative in the sense that she knew about the relationship from her aunt and Taher. This is hearsay. She herself was not able to confirm that the Deceased and the Accused shared a romantic relationship as a matter of fact. Although her adopted father admitted to being in a relationship with a man and had promised that he would break off the relationship, the identity of the man remained a mystery to her.",
      "108": "Witnesses who were told directly that the Deceased and the Accused were lovers were Taher and Mr Seet. Mr Seet had only heard from the Deceased that his lover was Astro but had never seen them in any intimate or romantic embrace. It was his evidence that before he was told about the romantic relationship, he once saw the Accused visit the Deceased at the SMRT Clubhouse and thought they were just friends. As for Taher, his evidence of the intimacy between the Deceased and Accused had been flickering and bordered on prejudice.",
      "109": "The Accused\u2019s sexual history as established in court revealed that since the age of 16, he had been involved in several romantic relationships with girls of his age. He only engaged in vaginal sex but never had anal sex with any of these girls. He also expressed his dislike and discomfort from unwanted attention that was showered upon him by homosexual men. I believe this evidence of the Accused. Thus, this court is inclined to find that, at the highest, this was a case of unrequited love on the part of the Deceased. This will not be too surprising if one were to look at the photographs of the Deceased and take into account the huge age difference between the Accused and the Deceased. From the totality of the evidence, I do not believe that the Accused and the Deceased had engaged in anal sex prior to the incident.",
      "110": "The defence of provocation is encapsulated in Exception 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code:",
      "111": "Chao Hick Tin JA in the case of Seah Kok Meng v PP [2001] 2 SLR(R) 24 at [21] (\u201cSeah Kok Meng\u201d) (in turn citing PP v Kwan Cin Cheng [1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 and Lau Lee Peng v PP [2000] 1 SLR(R) 448) held that there are two distinct requirements which must be satisfied before the defence of provocation can be successfully raised. First, is the subjective requirement that the accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation. Second, is the objective requirement that the provocation must have been \u201cgrave and sudden\u201d which involved the application of the \u201creasonable man\u201d test. The question involves considering whether an ordinary person of the same sex and age as the Accused, sharing such characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation, would have been so provoked as to lose his self-control.",
      "112": "It was held in Seah Kok Meng that the accused did not, in fact, lose his self-control due to provocation. The Court of Appeal was minded that after being informed by his girlfriend that she was molested by the victim, the accused had the presence of mind to do the only proper thing: to go there to \u201crescue\u201d her. On arrival, there was no altercation although the victim was standing close by. After the accused asked his girlfriend to hang up the phone and leave, there was some staring between the accused and the victim whereupon the appellant went to the back lane and came back armed with a wooden stick. It opined that every move of the accused was very deliberate and that he knew what he wanted to do, ie, he found his implement and took the offensive against the victim, literally to teach the latter a lesson.",
      "113": "The Prosecution also relied heavily on the case of Lim Chin Chong v PP [1998] 2 SLR(R) 278 (\u201cLim Chin Chong\u201d) owing to the factual similarities with the present case. In Lim Chin Chong, the appellant was a 19-year-old Malaysian who worked as a free lance male prostitute whereas the victim was his employer. After being propositioned for anal intercourse and forcefully kissed, the appellant killed the victim. The Court of Appeal found that on evidence, the subjective element had not been satisfied as the evidence showed beyond doubt that the appellant went about killing the deceased in a cool, calm and methodical way: after the accused had subdued the deceased with a punch on his nose, he went out of the room, found some electrical wire and tied the deceased\u2019s arms and legs. The appellant also gagged the deceased who was lying in bed calling for help. He then left the room again and found a long wooden pestle in the kitchen which he decided to use to bludgeon the deceased. At this juncture, he was interrupted by the return of another male prostitute and his customer. The appellant calmly went to the bedroom door and told them that he and the deceased were having sexual intercourse and were not to be disturbed. These acts, in the court\u2019s view, were not acts of a man who had lost control of himself and was in a frenzy. They were calculated and premeditated acts.",
      "114": "It was the Defence\u2019s case that the court should take into account the level of intoxication of the Accused on the night of 19 June 2008. Although the Accused had admitted to Dr Kenneth Koh (\u201cDr Koh\u201d) (PW27) that he usually drinks six bottles of alcohol over a day, the Accused\u2019s evidence was he had consumed 21\u20443 bottles of alcohol within a span of three hours on the night of the incident. During cross-examination, the Accused testified that the maximum amount of bottles of alcohol that he could take \u201cin one go\u201d was two to three bottles and that after two bottles, he would be half-drunk and would not be able to perform his normal functions.",
      "115": "Thus, the Defence submitted that as a result of this, the Accused was not able to retain his self-control when the Deceased repeatedly blackmailed him and insisted on having anal sex:",
      "116": "The Prosecution, on the other hand, submitted that the Accused\u2019s acts suggested that he was not half-conscious or drunk as he had claimed, ie, his evidence which downplayed his sobriety was contradicted by his actions which demonstrated that his mental faculties were functional and were not affected by alcohol:",
      "117": "In light of the above evidence, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused was not drunk, or even half-drunk as he had claimed, but was fully conscious of all his actions at the time of incident.",
      "118": "In the case of Seah Kok Meng ([110] supra), the court did not take into account the level of intoxication of the accused in its consideration of whether the accused had lost his self-control. However, I find that the facts in Seah Kok Meng are different from the present case. The accused in Seah Kok Meng had committed murder some seven hours after drinking. The Accused in the instant case was, on the other hand, inebriated in the sense that prior to the scuffle, he had just finished a bottle of Guinness Stout. The Prosecution further tendered its argument that even if the Accused had lost his self-control, in between the scuffle to his fleeing from the flat, he in fact regained self-control.",
      "119": "I note that counsel has not cited any authorities that dealt directly with the issue of whether the effects (if any) of intoxication may be taken into account as a factor in determining the Accused\u2019s loss of self-control when a defence of provocation is raised to a murder charge. In PP v Tharema Vejayan s/o Govindasamy [2009] SGHC 144, the two expert witnesses engaged by the Prosecution and Defence respectively were in agreement that the accused was intoxicated. Their disagreement was over whether the accused was so intoxicated that he was unable to form the requisite intention for the commission of the offence. However, when it came to the assessment of whether the accused actually lost self-control, the court was silent on the point of intoxication or the effects thereof.",
      "120": "There are significant authorities which have been and still are being raised by various courts across the Commonwealth in relation to the effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation. Lord Goff in the case of R v Morhall [1996] AC 90 (House of Lords) at 99 held that a diminished capacity for self-control arising from drunkenness (as an altered mental state affecting capacity for control) is an attribute that is not properly imputable to the reasonable person based on the general policy not to allow such an accused person to benefit from voluntary intoxication by drink or drug.",
      "121": "This court takes the view that the subjective assessment of whether the accused lost his self-control is essentially a finding of fact. Such a finding of fact would only adhere to and reflect reality if the accused\u2019s state of intoxication (or lack thereof) is taken into account. Any concern that an intoxicated man would be able to exonerate himself from an offence solely because he was intoxicated could be alleviated as intoxication, at this stage, is taken as one of the factors in determining whether he was in fact deprived of his self-control. A finding of intoxication does not automatically in itself warrant the operation of the defence of provocation, bearing in mind the need for the semi-objective test that has to be satisfied for this defence as a whole. See Seah Kok Meng.",
      "122": "Moreover, taking into account the state of intoxication of an accused in the subjective determination of loss of self-control would not detract from public policy in ensuring that no one, by his own volition of taking intoxicating substances (ie, drink or drug) could be excused of his lack of self-restraint, short of being completely incapable of controlling himself. It is important to note that the accused\u2019s state of intoxication is not attributed to the reasonable man. Hence, the reasonable man is one who is of the same age and sex of the accused, who shares the peculiar characteristics (which form the subject of provocation) as the accused but is one who is sober. The effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation relates only to the subjective element and the assessment of its effect should be determined on a case-by case basis, depending on the factual matrix of each case.",
      "123": "Notably, the Canadian courts have been applying the aforementioned approach. In the case of Wright v The Queen [1969] SCR 335, Fauteux J held that in determining whether the accused acted actually upon the provocation (applying a subjective test), the character, background, temperament, idiosyncrasies or the drunkenness of the accused are matters to be considered. However, they are excluded from the objective test as to hold otherwise would denude of any sense the objective test. I agree with this approach.",
      "124": "Social consumption of alcohol is almost universal in many societies. The physiological and psychological effects of alcohol vary from one individual to another. It is regrettable that this court is not assisted by any expert opinion on this matter pertaining to the effect of alcohol on a person\u2019s level of self-control and more particularly, whether the Accused had indeed lost his self-control on that day, having regard to his physical condition and ability to hold alcohol. This is especially so given that he had actually consumed a fairly large quantity of alcohol, which was not long before the scuffle and the subsequent application of the ligature. Even in the absence of expert opinion, this court, however, finds it proper to take into account and consider with some weight the effect of alcohol as another factor in the subjective determination of whether or not the Accused had in fact lost his self-control. I cannot disregard the oral testimony of the Accused that he had drunk alcohol and so he was not able to control his anger as well as himself, and that he had become angry pretty fast because of his alcohol consumption. I find that this part of the Accused\u2019s oral testimony on the effect of alcohol on his ability to control himself (viewed subjectively) is not something fanciful but evidence that I do give some weight to. The Prosecution wisely did not challenge this evidence on the basis that alcohol has absolutely no effect on a person\u2019s ability to control himself as it is common knowledge that it does have some effect, a fact which I can take judicial notice of even in the absence of expert evidence.",
      "125": "As Rubin J in PP v Sundarti Supriyanto ([88] supra) at [154] observed:",
      "126": "Although the Prosecution highlighted the fact that the Accused was likely to have tidied up the bed prior to leaving the room, this does not in itself warrant an inference that the Accused had, throughout the alleged crime, acted under a clear state of mind. The Accused\u2019s acts (by his own admission and supported by Aini and Ishak\u2019s evidence) of hastily throwing some clothing back into the wardrobe and some in the direction where the Accused was tied up before he left the flat were in contradiction with those of a person who was sober enough to clean up the aftermath of his crime.",
      "127": "This court is therefore inclined to find, on a balance of probabilities, that on the facts of the case the Accused had lost his self-control. In contrast with the accused persons in Seah Kok Meng ([110] supra) and Lim Chin Chong ([112] supra), the time lapse between the scuffle and the Accused\u2019s fleeing the flat was relatively short, ie, an approximate 30 minutes. Thus it could be inferred that the Accused\u2019s acts were committed in a state of frenzy without pre-meditation or any cooling-off period. The appellant in Lim Chin Chong was found not to have his lost self-control as he had ample time to search for a deadly weapon and even present himself in a cool and calm manner in the face of queries by the suspecting male prostitute who \u201cinterrupted\u201d his slaying of the victim. Thus the factual circumstances between Lim Chin Chong and the present case are quite different.",
      "128": "The Court of Appeal in Lim Chin Chong also did not find that the provocation was grave and sudden. The alleged provocation was the deceased propositioning the appellant to engage in anal intercourse and pulling the appellant onto the bed and kissing him. There was also the threat of setting secret society members onto the appellant. The court at [31] found that the propositioning and the kissing taken together could hardly be said to be provocative or was so disgusting and abhorrent as to have aroused revulsion in a person who, on his own admission, made a living by prostituting himself to other men even if he was to be believed that his service did not include kissing or anal intercourse.",
      "129": "If it did, then the immediate and spontaneous reaction was the punch on the nose which immobilised the deceased to such an extent that appellant was able to leave the room, find the electrical wire and return to tie the deceased and gag him. The court in Lim Chin Chong opined that on any objective test the provocation of being sodomised had simply evaporated and the threat of being got at by secret members was just a hollow threat. Thus, the Court of Appeal was of view that there was no grave and sudden provocation which posed an immediate threat to the appellant.",
      "130": "The Defence submitted that the Deceased\u2019s proposition for anal sex and taunt about how the Accused was being \u201ccultivated\u201d by the Deceased all the while amounted to grave and sudden provocation.",
      "131": "In determining whether there was \u201csudden\u201d provocation, the Defence submitted that an analogy should be drawn with the case of PP v Sundarti Supriyanto ([88] supra) whereby a series of abuse with no break in time that provided the accused with a cooling-off period was found to satisfy the requirement of suddenness (at see [155] to [165]).",
      "132": "The Accused had allegedly been suffering from a \u201cseries of abuse\u201d, as coined by the Defence. The \u201cseries of abuse\u201d took the form of caressing and touching by the Deceased. It was the Accused\u2019s evidence that from the first time he stayed at the Deceased flat (sometime around November 2007), the Deceased had started caressing him when they were in bed. The series of touching became more serious when the Deceased started to grope the Accused\u2019s buttocks on the 18 June 2008. The Accused, although growing increasingly uncomfortable with these touching, protested in silence as he did not want to offend the Deceased, his sole source of dependence in Singapore.",
      "133": "The Accused testified that on the night of 19 June 2008, he had \u201cgiven up his dignity\u201d and allowed the Deceased to perform fellatio on him. Thus, the account of events, from the touching and caressing up to the point of fellatio should be viewed as part of an ongoing process in the context of provocation. When the Deceased further requested for anal sex and taunted the Accused for being \u201ccultivated\u201d by him, the Accused having earlier succumbed to the Deceased\u2019s harassment, had had enough and I accept that the Accused suddenly erupted in rage and lost control of himself.",
      "134": "The Prosecution further submitted that during the scuffle, there were moments when the Accused had time to leave the flat. When the Deceased was lying on the floor groaning in pain, the \u201cprovocation\u201d (if any) had evaporated. The Defence, on the other hand, submitted that the scuffle and incidents between the Deceased and Accused were part and parcel of an ongoing process.",
      "135": "Although there was an estimated time lapse of 30 seconds when the Accused just stared at the Deceased who was lying on the floor, it would be artificial in my view to carve up the time frame into intervals of seconds and analyse them rationally. One should be mindful not to expect a man who had acted in the heat of passion to be able to weigh the golden scales of reaction as one can in a calm court room. The relatively short interval between the act of fellatio to the scuffle indicates to me a lack of cooling-off period. Moreover, there was no evidence of any premeditation on the part of the Accused. Hence, objectively assessed, the requirement of suddenness is satisfied.",
      "136": "As to whether a proposition of anal sex was \u201cgrave\u201d, it was found in DPP v Camplin [1978] AC 705 that the deceased\u2019s acts of committing buggery and later taunting at the accused, a 15-year-old boy, was sufficiently grave provocation.",
      "137": "In the Australian case of Green v R (1997) 148 ALR 659 the accused had been drinking one night with the deceased who was some twenty years older than him, but whom he viewed as a long-standing and trusted friend. The deceased made a sexual advance which the accused brushed off, saying that he was not interested. The accused then went to bed but was followed by the deceased who came into his room naked, got into bed with him, grabbed hold of the accused and touched his groin. The accused responded by repeatedly punching the deceased approximately fifteen times, stabbing him ten times with scissors and banging the deceased\u2019s head into the bedroom wall.",
      "138": "On appeal, Brennan CJ, sitting in the Australian High Court (in a 3:2 decision) held that the \u201creal sting\u201d of the provocation lay in the deceased\u2019s attempts to \u201cviolate the sexual integrity of a man who had trusted him as a friend and a father figure\u201d and also in \u201chis persistent homosexual advances\u201d.",
      "139": "The classic justification for the existence of the provocation defence is that it provides a concession to human frailty. The extension of this defence to \u201cnon-violent homosexual advances\u2019 as per the instant case would rest in the recognition of the fact that most heterosexual men would view such homosexual advances as sufficiently provocative. The more intrusive the advances, the more grave and provocative they would be.",
      "140": "The Accused in the instant case was outraged, disappointed and sickened by the Deceased\u2019s proposition for anal intercourse as it was disgusting to him. The Accused found it inconceivable to engage in anal intercourse, even with women, and described the act as \u201ca dirty channel\u201d due to its unhygienic nature. Objectively viewed, an unwanted proposition for anal intercourse in the circumstances of this case does amount to a grave provocation.",
      "141": "In his examination-in-chief, the Accused expressed his despair when the Deceased reminded him of all the good deeds he had done for the Accused and that he had secured a roof over the Accused\u2019s head. The case of DPP v Camplin ([133] supra) at 726 noted that:",
      "142": "As Jeremy Horder in Provocation and Responsibility (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992) at pp 138\u2013139 pointed out:",
      "143": "Thus, the Deceased\u2019s emotional blackmail translated the Accused\u2019s subservience into anger and outrage. Such a taunt on the Accused\u2019s financial and even livelihood dependence on the Deceased was arguably the sting of the provocation which had added to the gravity of it.",
      "144": "This court therefore finds, on balance of probabilities, that the Accused had lost his self-control in the face of a sudden and grave provocation and that he had applied the ligature while still being deprived of his power of self-control.",
      "145": "The Defence also sought to rely on Exception 4 to s 300 of the Penal Code:",
      "146": "The three requirements to be met for the defence to operate are:",
      "147": "The case of Tan Chee Wee ([66] supra) at [60] held that the word \u201cfight\u201d implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. It is not sufficient merely for there to be \u201can offer of violence on both sides\u201d in the words of the court in Jusab Usman v State (1983) XXIV Guj LR 1148. Worth noting is that the wording of Exception 4 states \u201ca sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel\u201d. As such, this clearly indicates that it must have been the intention of Legislature that \u201cfight\u201d must mean something more than just a mere quarrel.",
      "148": "There cannot be a fight if the victim keeps quiet and does nothing as that is simply a one-sided attack. See Tan Chee Wee at [61]. In Tan Chee Wee, the appellant had struck the deceased on the head with a hammer. It was doubtful that this attack could be regarded as a fight as there was no evidence that there was an exchange of blows even though the attack had supposedly arisen after the victim had grabbed a knife.",
      "149": "The forensic evidence before this court suggests that there is a lack of fight between the Deceased and Accused. It was A/P Gilbert Lau\u2019s observation that there were no typical defensive injuries found on the Deceased\u2019s body.",
      "150": "The Defence suggested that the congealed blood found on the floor beneath the Deceased\u2019s head had resulted from an injury caused by the scuffle, in the form of abrasion, to the lips or face. A/P Gilbert Lau\u2019s reply was that although he was unable to exclude that possibility entirely, he was of view that it was very unlikely for the following reasons:",
      "151": "Even if I were to characterise the brief struggle as a fight, there is nothing to show that the ligature was applied during the sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel. The Deceased\u2019s act of cajoling the Accused and the Accused\u2019s brushing his advances off cannot in any way be seen as quarrel. This is crucial because the operation of the exception requires that there must be a killing whilst both parties are gripped by the inflammation of passions caused by a sudden quarrel. See Tan Chee Wee at [63].",
      "152": "Given that there is a lack of quarrel and/or fight from the objective evidence, the first limb of the defence is not made out and this court therefore takes the view that the defence of sudden fight does not apply to the present case.",
      "153": "In light of the foregoing, I find the Accused not guilty of the charge of murder under s 300 of the Penal Code. However, I made a finding in [96] above that Accused is guilty of the offence of culpable homicide under s 299 of the Penal Code. As it was done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, it is punishable under s 304(b) of the Penal Code. Accordingly I convict him of the offence of culpable homicide under s 299 and punish him under s 304(b) of the Penal Code. I shall adjourn for the Prosecution and the Defence to prepare their submissions on sentence."

Whilst they were making their way peacefully, they were set upon by the two accused persons, Galing Anak Kujat (\u201cGaling\u201d) and Jabing Kho (\u201cJabing\u201d).",
      "2": "Cao Ruyin (\u201cthe deceased\u201d) suffered severe head injuries, which led to his death on 23 February 2008, and was also robbed of his handphone. Wu Jun escaped with minor injuries.",

      "4": "Galing and Jabing were not arrested for several days after the assault. The records of the deceased\u2019s handphone enabled the police to conduct investigations and arrest the two accused persons and their friends.",
      "5": "There were only three persons who gave direct evidence of the attack, namely, Wu Jun, and the two accused persons. At the trial, the prosecution tendered in evidence seven statements taken from Galing and six statements from Jabing. All these statements were admitted in evidence without objection.",
      "6": "The first statement recorded from Galing was recorded by Senior Station Inspector Razali bin Razak (\u201cSSI Razali\u201d). In this statement[note: 1] Galing recounted that:",
      "7": "(The person referred to as \u201cVincent\u201d is also referred to as \u201cVencent\u201d, and his full name is Vencent Anak Anding.)",
      "8": "A cautioned statement was recorded from Galing later on the same day in response to a charge that he, Vencent Anak Anding and three other persons had murdered the deceased. The statement[note: 2] reads:",
      "9": "The Investigation Officer of the case, Senior Station Inspector Zainal Abidin Ismail (\u201cSSI Zainal\u201d) recorded investigation statements from Galing on 3, 4 and 6 March 2008 with the service of a Malay interpreter, Marriana. In these statements Galing recounted that on 17 February 2008, Vencent had proposed to him that they rob two Bangladeshi persons. Galing agreed, and went to Tiong Bahru where the robbery was to take place. Other persons, namely, Jabing and Anthony Anak Jaban also agreed to join them in the scheme. The robbery was aborted because the group could not find the two targets. Another person, Alan Anak Ajan, joined the group, and they consumed liquor known as \u201cNarcissus Ginseng Wine Tonic\u201d.",
      "10": "Eventually they left Tiong Bahru and went to Geylang. Galing stated that his intention was to meet some friends there and to drink with them. Galing\u2019s account of the events that followed merits reproduction:",
      "11": "Galing went on to state that Vencent paid him $300 for the stolen handphone, and he distributed $50 of that to each member of the group and used the remaining $50 to pay for their food and drinks. (Subsequently, Vencent sold the handphone to a dealer, and that enabled the police to trace and apprehend him, Jabing and the others.)",
      "12": "Galing added in his statement:",
      "13": "When he was questioned by the recording officer about the targeting of the two victims at Geylang, Galing explained:",
      "14": "The first statement of Jabing was recorded on 26 February 2008[note: 4] by SSI Zainal. In the statement, Jabing recounted that Galing, Vencent, Anthony and Alan were planning to rob two Bangladeshi persons in Tiong Bahru, but were unable to carry that out because they could not find the two men.",

      "19": "Jabing recounted that when the robbery at Tiong Bahru was aborted, Anthony suggested to the rest of the group that they go to Geylang to rob because there was an open field opposite Lorong 4 which was an ideal place for a robbery as it was dark and secluded.",
      "20": "Jabing then referred to the events leading to the attack. He stated:",
      "21": "Wu Jun was a construction worker from China. The deceased was from his same village in China. On 17 February 2008, the deceased had visited him. They had dinner, and when it was time for the deceased to return to his lodging, Wu Jun accompanied him to the Kallang MRT station.",
      "22": "As they were walking along a paved pathway at the open field, he was hit at the back of his head by something hard like a metal object. (He was subsequently brought to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for treatment and was found to have a left ear laceration and abrasions in the temporal region of his head.) He ran a few steps forward, turned round and saw a male person wearing a cap coming towards him in a menacing manner with a clenched fist, and he carried on running as fast as he could. He heard the deceased groaning in pain. However, he did not know whether he or the deceased was attacked first, how the deceased was attacked or who attacked the deceased.",
      "23": "After running about forty steps he stopped. He called for the police on his handphone and retraced his steps along the pavement. He found the deceased lying unconscious on the grass alone. The deceased had blood on his face and was vomiting blood. Wu Jun noticed that the deceased\u2019s handphone which was usually kept in his waist pouch was missing.",
      "24": "The deceased was brought from the scene of the attack to the Accident and Emergency Department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Dr Ho Chi Long (\u201cDr Ho\u201d), the physician who saw the deceased and operated on him certified that on admission, the deceased was in a deep coma and had facial injuries. The deceased had sustained life threatening injuries. CT scans revealed several depressed skull fractures including multiple comminuted, displaced and depressed fractures involving the frontal, bilateral parietal and occipital bones with fractured ethmoid septae, and swelling of the brain. He underwent surgery on that day, and further surgery on the following day, but he did not recover and died on 23 February 2008. Dr Ho was of the view that the primary cause of death was the severe head injuries.",
      "25": "Dr Ho was unable to tell if the head fractures were caused by a blunt or a sharp instrument, but they were caused by a huge force that could have come from several blows. In answer to a question from Mr Chandra Mohan, counsel for Galing, Dr Ho stated that it was impossible for the injuries to have been sustained from a fall from a standing position. In response to a question from Mr Johan, counsel for Jabing, Dr Ho could not say whether the head injuries could have been sustained by the deceased falling forwards after being hit from behind.",
      "26": "Pathologist Dr Teo Eng Swee (\u201cDr Teo\u201d) performed the autopsy on the deceased. In his autopsy report[note: 5] he noted that there were fourteen fractures of the skull with three areas of severe haemorrhage, and that the brain was soft and severely oedematous (swollen). Dr Teo certified the cause of death to be severe head injury.",
      "27": "Dr Teo explained that the severe head injury recorded in his autopsy report did not refer to the fractures of the skull. The fractures by themselves were not the fatal injury. The fatal injury was the injury to the brain. The brain was very swollen, and the swelling decreased the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain. The lack of oxygen supply to the brain is known as hypoxia. The swelling of the brain also caused it to shift position in the skull, and that is known as herniation. The hypoxia and the herniation together with brain contusions and brain haemorrhage made up the severe head injury, and the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.",
      "28": "Dr Teo was of the opinion that the skull fractures could have been caused by five impacts or more, and that one fracture could have resulted from a blow or a fall on the back of the head, and that the initial fragmentation of the skull required severe force, but when the skull was fractured, the further fractures could be caused by less severe force.",
      "29": "The prosecutor showed Dr Teo the belt and buckle that Galing used in the assault, and sought Dr Teo\u2019s assistance to make connections between the buckle and the deceased\u2019s injuries, but Dr Teo was cautious and declined to draw any conclusions.",
      "30": "When Dr Teo was informed of Galing\u2019s account in his statement that a severed tree branch about two feet long was used by Jabing to strike at the deceased, Dr Teo agreed that such a weapon was capable of causing the injuries that were found on the deceased\u2019s skull.",
      "31": "When Mr Johan sought to get Dr Teo to develop on his conclusion that one of the fractures may have been the result of a fall, Dr Teo put the matter into context and explained that:",
      "32": "and he clarified in re-examination that a fall could not cause all the fractures that were sustained.",
      "33": "The accused persons\u2019 statements and the medical evidence was the core of the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "34": "Neither counsel submitted that there was no case for his client to answer. When I called on both accused persons to enter their defence both of them gave evidence, but did not call any witnesses.",
      "35": "Galing is 25 years old and he had come to Singapore to work. He helped to load oil onto ships.",
      "36": "He relied on his statements as his defence. His defence was that he did not cause the death of the deceased and that the death was not caused in the furtherance of the common intention of him and Jabing. He began his evidence saying that he had borrowed the belt that he wore and used from Anthony on the morning of 17 February 2008.",
      "37": "He then recounted that Vencent had proposed robbing two Bangladeshis who had just received their salary. He agreed, and went to Tiong Bahru with Anthony. At Tiong Bahru they met up with Vencent, and subsequently Jabing and Alan joined them. The five of them had bought and drank ginseng liquor after the robbery was called off. After they had their drinks, he told the others that he was going to continue drinking with his friends in Geylang, and the others agreed to go to Geylang with him.",
      "38": "They went from Tiong Bahru by the MRT to the Kallang MRT station. Upon arrival at the Kallang MRT station, they proceeded to Lorong 4 Geylang. He first went to a hotel, the Yunnan Hotel, to change into fresh clothes that were kept there. He then rejoined the group and told the others that he was going to Lorong 12 to have drinks with friends there, and they went on together towards Lorong 12. Along the way, they split into two groups. He and Jabing were walking along a higher stretch of the road, and the other three were walking along a lower stretch.",
      "39": "After he and Jabing passed an overhead bridge, Jabing crossed the road. He followed Jabing, and when they were on the middle road divider, he asked Jabing where he was going, and Jabing told him that he wanted to rob two Chinese men who were on the other side of the road. He told Jabing not to do that, but Jabing ignored him and continued to cross the road.",
      "40": "Galing was still on the road divider when he saw Jabing pick up something from the ground and went towards the two Chinese men, and hit one of them. The other Chinese man wanted to fight with Jabing. Galing took off his belt and went to Jabing\u2019s assistance. He rolled up the belt in his left hand, and hit one of the Chinese men once at the back part of his body, and that man ran away and Galing chased him. (Galing confirmed in court that that person was Wu Jun). When Galing failed to catch up with Wu Jun, he retraced his steps. As he came to the deceased who was seated and was getting up, he hit the deceased on the area of the chest but he did not think that it could cause serious injury or death to the deceased. After hitting him, he noticed the deceased\u2019s handphone and he took it. In the meantime, Jabing was chasing after Wu Jun who had apparently returned to the scene.",
      "41": "He went on to Lorong 12 to look for the friends he intended to meet, but did not find them. Subsequently, he joined the other members of the group at a coffee shop at Lorong 24. He showed the handphone to the others, and Vencent paid him $300 for it. With the $300, he paid $50 to each member of the group and left the remaining $50 to pay for the food and drinks they were having.",
      "42": "During cross-examination he qualified parts of his statements relating to his taking of the deceased\u2019s handphone and Jabing\u2019s assault on the deceased. When Mr Johan questioned him on his cautioned statement where he stated \u201c... I saw him [Jabing] hitting the Chinese man several times and his head cracked open\u201d he gave inconsistent answers. He said \u201cAs far as I can recall, I did not say that\u201d[note: 7] and \u201cThe IO told me that the person was already dead. I was frightened ... so I said all these things.\u201d[note: 8]",
      "43": "More inconsistencies were to follow when he was cross-examined by the prosecutor. He admitted that he took the deceased\u2019s handphone but said that it was on the ground. When it was pointed out to him that he had stated in his cautioned statement \u201cWhile the Chinese man was holding his head, I took a handphone from his waist pouch\u201d his explanation was \u201c... I was frightened and I was told by the officer that I must cooperate. That is why I said this in my statement\u201d and \u201cIt was a suggestion made by the IO. I merely agreed to the suggestion.\u201d[note: 9]",
      "44": "Galing had stated on three occasions in his statements that he had taken the handphone from the deceased\u2019s waist or waist pouch.[note: 10] He did not offer any reason for insisting in court that it was on the ground when he took it. In any event, the legal character of his action was similar whether the handphone was taken from the deceased\u2019s waist, or from the ground after the deceased dropped it during the assault.",
      "45": "When Galing persisted that he had seen Jabing hit the deceased once, the prosecutor referred him to his first statement[note: 11] where he had stated \u201c... Jabing used the wood to hit on the male Chinese who has a bigger built on his head\u201d and \u201c... I saw the bigger size male Chinese try to run but Jabing continue to beat him\u201d and to his cautioned statement which recorded that \u201cI saw him hitting the Chinese man several times and his head cracked open\u201d and his investigation statement[note: 12] that \u201cJabing who was hitting the other Chinese with the wood in his hands repeatedly ...\u201d.",
      "46": "Galing\u2019s explanation was that:",
      "47": "When the prosecutor also referred him to another part of his investigation statement[note: 14] where it was recorded \u201cI gave up the Chinese and turned back towards Jabing who was hitting the other Chinese with the wood in his hands repeatedly ...\u201d he gave a similar explanation that \u201c... I did say this in my statement but I also remember the IO saying that it must be several blows. But I recall ... seeing Jabing hitting only once.\u201d[note: 15]",
      "48": "In the course of cross-examination by the prosecution, Galing agreed that he should proceed along the side of Sims Way that he was on to go to Lorong 12, and that when he crossed Sims Way and went onto the open ground as he did, he was going out of the way.[note: 16]",
      "49": "In re-examination by his counsel, Galing added confusion to the matters. He stated that no one had suggested the use of \u201ccontinue\u201d in his first statement[note: 17] and that the recording officer SSI Razali was not involved in the use of the word.[note: 18]",
      "50": "No issue on the accuracy of the recording and interpretation of the statements were raised when the statements were admitted into evidence during the prosecution\u2019s case. After they were raised in the course of defence case, Mr Chandra Mohan applied for three officers SSI Razali, who recorded the first statement, SSI Zainal, who recorded the investigation statements and Marriana, the Malay interpreter who assisted SSI Zainal in the recording of the investigation statements, to be recalled for further examination, and they were recalled.",
      "51": "Counsel put to them Galing\u2019s allegations on the recording of the statements, but they rejected each allegation and maintained that the statements faithfully and accurately recorded what Galing had said. I accepted their evidence.",
      "52": "Jabing is 24 years old and is from Sarawak. He was working in Singapore for a karung guni company.",
      "53": "He did not dispute the admissibility and the accuracy of his statements which were admitted in evidence. When he gave his evidence in chief, he kept to his statements and elaborated on parts of his account of the events. Notably, he said that after he consumed the ginseng liquor with his friends at Tiong Bahru, he was \u2018high\u2019. Nevertheless, he confirmed that the group had gone to Geylang to rob and that he and Galing had trailed the two Chinese (i.e. Wu Jun and the deceased) because they wanted to rob them. He confirmed that he had picked up a tree branch about a foot long, but he could not explain why he did that.",
      "54": "His evidence on his assault of the deceased was that he hit the deceased on the head, but he did not know the force he used, or the part of the head he hit because he was drunk. He also said that he had not aimed for the deceased\u2019s head because his mind was blank and it just happened that he hit the head. He recalled that when the deceased fell, and turned his body to face upwards, he hit the deceased again, but he cannot remember where the second hit landed. Jabing maintained that he had no intention to hit the deceased on the head, and did not intend to kill him. Mr Chandra Mohan questioned him on the involvement between him and Galing in the assault. Jabing agreed that there was no planning on the execution of the robbery, no agreement on the location of the robbery or the division of functions, no common intention on the use of weapons, and no common intention to assault or kill.",
      "55": "When the prosecutor cross-examined him, Jabing was unable to explain why he followed Galing when he crossed the road. He acknowledged when he trailed the victims, he intended to rob them. He claimed that his intention was to punch the victims, but when he saw the branch, he \u201cjust took it\u201d. He also agreed that he did not gave the deceased any forewarning of his approach, and had not issued any threats before he hit him. He also maintained that he did not aim for the deceased\u2019s head when he struck, and it was only when the deceased fell to the ground holding his head that he realised he had struck the deceased\u2019s head.",
      "56": "In every case, there will be disputes over some facts. The disputes may arise between the prosecution and the accused persons or between the accused persons themselves. Some areas of disputes could be material, and others less so, depending on the circumstances of the case. In this case, there are two areas of dispute that are material and have to be addressed.",
      "57": "Jabing admitted that he and Galing had spotted Wu Jun and the deceased and they had intended to rob them, but Galing denied that he had any intention to rob. He admitted that he had intended to rob the two Bangladeshis in Tiong Bahru. When that was aborted, he went with his friends to Geylang with the intention to seek out other friends in Lorong 12 and to drink with them. He did not want to rob the two Chinese men, and had told Jabing not to do it, but was nevertheless drawn into the events that followed.",
      "58": "I did not accept Galing\u2019s explanation because:\n(i)     he was prepared to rob, and had intended to do that in Tiong Bahru;\n(ii)     his claim that he was on the way to Lorong 12 was inconsistent with his action because he should not have crossed Sims Way and gone onto the open field if he wanted to proceed to Lorong 12;\n(iii)     he knew that Jabing was going to rob, and he stayed on with Jabing and assisted him in attacking the victims;\n(iv)     he completed the robbery by taking the deceased\u2019s handphone; and\n(v)     he shared the proceeds on the sale of the handphone with Jabing and the others.",
      "59": "These facts showed that he was a willing participant in the robbery with Jabing.",
      "60": "The evidence of Dr Teo indicated that the deceased\u2019s death resulted from the head injuries. Although Galing did not inflict those injuries, he saw Jabing picking up the tree branch. He also armed himself with the belt buckle which he used as a weapon. It was clear that Galing and Jabing intended to use their weapons in the robbery because they did not seek to obtain the victims\u2019 possessions by demand or the threat of violence, but had proceeded immediately to use their weapons on them. Their intention was to rob their victims by the use of force. It was telling that Galing had not said in his statements and his evidence that he was surprised when Jabing held the branch in both hands and struck the deceased with it. I find that Galing knew that when he and Jabing robbed the deceased, the deceased would be assaulted and serious injuries might be inflicted on him.",
      "61": "In the case of Jabing, he admitted in his first statement of 26 February 2008[note: 19] that he swung the branch towards the head of the deceased. He also recalled in his investigation statement[note: 20] that the single blow caused the deceased to fall onto the ground. Galing, his accomplice, recalled in his cautioned statement[note: 21] that the deceased\u2019s head cracked open when Jabing hit him on the head. In his investigation statement, Galing had also narrated that Jabing had beaten the deceased so badly that he could have died.[note: 22]",
      "62": "Jabing\u2019s narration of the events showed that he was not so drunk that he did not know or remember his actions, and he knew what he was doing. In any event, he could not plead drunkenness as a defence because s 85(2) of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed) stipulates that:",
      "63": "and he had not satisfied conditions (a) or (b).",
      "64": "Against this background, I find that:\n(i)     the two accused persons had the common intention to commit robbery;\n(ii)     each of them knew that it was likely that serious injury might be inflicted on the victims in the course of the robbery;\n(iii)     that Jabing intentionally inflicted head injuries on the deceased; and\n(iv)     the injuries inflicted were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and did cause the deceased\u2019s death.",
      "65": "The law relating to common intention and s 34 was thoroughly reviewed by the Court of Appeal in Lee Chez Kee v PP [2008] 3 SLR(R) 447. In the leading judgment, V K Rajah JA concluded in the \u201cSummary of the correct interpretation of section 34 of the Penal Code\u201d that:",
      "66": "While the common intention of Galing and Jabing was to rob, and not to kill, they knew that there was the likelihood that serious injury might be inflicted.",
      "67": "Was the common intention sufficient to support a charge of murder? Section 300 of the Penal Code states that:",
      "68": "The intention to cause death specified in limb (a) and the knowledge of the likelihood of death specified in limb (b) are not there.",
      "69": "However, the prosecution was putting its case under limb (c). This effect of s 300(c) of the Penal Code is settled law. The locus classicus is the decision of the Supreme Court of India in Virsa Singh v State of Punjab AIR 1958 SC 464 where Bose J reviewed the elements of the provision and declared at [12]:",
      "70": "and at [16] that:",
      "71": "His analysis has been affirmed and applied by our Court of Appeal in a succession of cases, the most recent being PP v Lim Poh Lye [2005] 4 SLR(R) 582.",
      "72": "Jabing had struck the deceased on the head in order to rob him. Jabing held the branch in both hands and swung it at the deceased\u2019s head with such force that Galing saw his head crack open. Dr Teo found that the head injuries inflicted on the deceased were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and he certified the injuries to be the cause of death. Jabing\u2019s actions fell within s 300(c).",
      "73": "I find Galing and Jabing to be guilty of the charge against them. They are convicted and sentenced to suffer the mandatory death penalty."

      "1": "The deceased, described as a lively girl with a penchant for mischief and who cried very loudly, died on 6 January 2009 \u2013 22 days short of her second birthday. The cause of death was certified as \u201chaemopericardium, due to ruptured inferior vena cava\u201d. The inferior vena cava (\u201cIVC\u201d) is the large vein that carries de-oxygenated blood from the lower half of the body into the right atrium of the heart. It had ruptured and the severe bleeding that followed caused her heart to fail. The deceased died within minutes of the rupture. Her father, [AFR], stands charged before me for murder. The charge states as follows:",
      "2": "At 8.06pm on 6 January 2009, Sergeant Francis Wong (\u201cSgt Wong\u201d) and his ambulance crew (comprising of Corporal Hairil Izuan Bin Fadzil, Sri Nurul Hatta Bte Sa\u2019Don and driver Sergeant Shamsul Jalala B Sahdan) were directed to attend a case where \u201cmedical assistance was required at the void deck of [address redacted] near to a temple\u201d. Sgt Wong had some problem locating the caller at Blk [xxx], but after making several calls to the mobile number provided, the crew managed to find the location. There, they found [AFR] and his wife, [B]; she was carrying the deceased. Sgt Wong said that when he saw the deceased, she was already blue and showed no signs of life: there was no respiration, pulse or blood pressure. He applied cardiac pulmonary resuscitation on the deceased and also used a defibrillator. But it was to no avail \u2013 the deceased did not show any heartbeat throughout. Sgt Wong observed that the deceased had multiple bruises on her face, neck, arms, legs and back, and blood was oozing from her nose. On the way to the [V] Hospital, Sgt Wong recorded that [B] had informed him that [AFR] had kicked the deceased\u2019s back and punched her on various parts of her body because she had played with his cigarettes. [B] also said that [AFR] had beaten the deceased on many other occasions. Sgt Wong\u2019s evidence is, in large measure, corroborated by the testimonies of the rest of his crew.",
      "3": "Upon arrival at [V] Hospital, the deceased was immediately attended to by Dr [W]. Dr [W] testified that the deceased showed no signs of life: she was unresponsive and without heartbeat. Resuscitation efforts continued, but were stopped after about 30 minutes. Dr [W] pronounced the deceased dead at 9.28pm on 6 January 2009. He then conducted a visual examination of the deceased and observed multiple bruises on various parts of her body, as well as a bleeding nose and patulous anus (meaning that the anus was loose) with bloody ooze which suggested an anal tear.",
      "4": "Sergeant Keegan Goh (\u201cSgt Goh\u201d) and Sergeant Nur Hazlina Bte Abdul Rahman (\u201cSgt Nur Hazlina\u201d) were on duty at the [V] Hospital Police Post that night. They went up to [AFR] who was in the waiting area of the Accident and Emergency department where the deceased was being attended to. Sgt Goh asked [AFR] what had happened and he replied that he had slapped and punched the deceased as he was upset with her for playing with and eating his cigarettes. Sgt Goh asked [AFR] to go over to the Police Post for further questioning. At the Police Post, [AFR] told Sgt Goh that the deceased had been naughty and played with his cigarettes. He had slapped her three to four times, punched her in the back three to four times and punched her left arm twice. Sgt Goh said that a short while afterwards, [AFR] received a call on his mobile phone as a result of which he started crying and collapsed on the floor. It turned out that the call was from [B] and she told [AFR] that the deceased had died. Sgt Goh and Sgt Nur Hazlina helped [AFR] back up to the chair and eventually calmed him down. They then placed [AFR] under arrest for murder of the deceased.",
      "5": "The only two eye-witnesses to the events leading to the death of the deceased were her mother ([B]) and father ([AFR]). Their evidence was that on 6 January 2009, [AFR] had awakened late, at around 2.00pm. By that time [B] had bathed and dressed their three daughters. The deceased was the eldest; the other two, [C] and [D], were a year old and two months old respectively at the time. [AFR] went out and bought lunch for the family \u2013 nasi briyani for himself, chicken rice for [B] and chicken porridge for the deceased and [C]. He went home and after eating his lunch he fed [C] and the deceased. At about 6.30pm, [AFR] and [B] left the three children asleep in the Boon Lay flat and went to the nearby NTUC Supermarket to buy groceries. [AFR] saw some dolls for sale and suggested to [B] that they should buy one for the deceased as her birthday was approaching and he was afraid that he might not have another opportunity to buy something in time. [AFR] decided to buy two dolls in order to be fair to [C]. They paid for the items and returned to the [address redacted] flat at about 7.30pm.",
      "6": "[B] testified that [AFR] entered the flat first and while she was still outside, she heard him shout at the deceased in Malay, saying that he had previously told her not to be stubborn and asking why she was playing with the cigarettes. He told the deceased that she had other toys and again asked why did she not play with those instead. [B] went in and saw several broken sticks of cigarettes on the living room floor as well as on the sofa and mattress. She saw [AFR] shouting at the deceased in the kitchen and he slapped the deceased on her face and arms several times. The deceased, who was seated on the floor of the kitchen and crying loudly, turned away. [B] went to the living room and used a broom to sweep up the cigarettes. She then heard [C] and [D] crying in the bedroom, so she stopped and went into the bedroom to attend to them. This took a few minutes, and she then returned to the kitchen. As she walked in, she saw [AFR] kick and step on the deceased\u2019s back several times. The deceased was in a seated position on the floor but with her upper body bent forward so that her chest and face were touching the floor. [B] demonstrated with a mannequin how [AFR] had used his feet to stamp on the deceased\u2019s back, and how he had kicked her on the left side of her back several times with the upper part of his foot. She went to [AFR] and stopped him from hitting the deceased further. The deceased was on the floor and crying away, but her cries grew weaker and she started gasping for breath. [B] picked the deceased up and held her; she berated [AFR] and asked if he had beaten the deceased hard. He replied that he did not know. [B] saw blood flowing out from the deceased\u2019s nose, which she cleaned with water. She told [AFR] to fill a milk bottle with water and she then tried to make the deceased drink it. But the deceased only groaned in pain and did not drink. [B] tried to gave her some chocolate but she could not eat. [B] then noticed that the deceased\u2019s lips had turned pale and that the groans had grown weaker. She passed the deceased to [AFR] and said that they should send her to a hospital.",
      "7": "According to [AFR], when he entered the flat, he was going to give the doll to the deceased. But when he saw her playing with and chewing on his cigarettes, he became upset. He claimed that the deceased had, only two days earlier, been caught eating his cigarettes. On that occasion he had scolded her and warned her not to do it again. This time, [AFR] took the deceased by the hand and pulled her into the kitchen. There he asked her if she had eaten the cigarettes. He said that if she wanted anything, he could have bought it for her. The deceased started crying and [AFR] noticed that she was still holding on to some cigarettes in her left hand. He slapped her hand and this made the deceased cry even louder. [AFR] said that he felt stressed by this. This is an excerpt from his testimony, as interpreted into English:",
      "8": "[AFR] went on to describe how he slapped the deceased on the face, after which she fell into a kneeling position. Her cries grew louder. [AFR] said that he then punched her on her upper right arm and upper left arm. The deceased turned away to avoid his punches. He then pulled both her ears when her back was turned to him and punched her on the back three to four times. The deceased fell on the floor. At this point, [B] came into the kitchen and used the handle of a broom to hit the deceased\u2019s back twice as she lay face down on the floor. Both [AFR] and [B] then went into the living room. From there [AFR] saw the deceased stand up and then fall to the floor face downwards.",
      "9": "The evidence of [B] and [AFR] contradict each other in two main ways. Firstly, [AFR] claimed he did not use his feet on the deceased but [B] said she saw him kick and step on the deceased while she was face down on the floor of the kitchen. According to [AFR], he had only slapped and punched the deceased. Secondly, [AFR] claimed that [B] had used a broomstick to hit the deceased on the back twice. The defence pointed out two linear bruises on the deceased\u2019s back that could only have come from a blow from a straight object like a stick. This issue will be covered in greater detail when the pathologist\u2019s evidence is considered at [12] below. [B] strenuously denied that she had used the broomstick on the deceased. I note that when asked for a demonstration, [AFR]\u2019s re-enactment showed that the blow was only a light one \u2013 which is consistent with the linear bruises.",
      "10": "According to [B], both she and [AFR] left the flat and tried to hail a taxi when they realized that all was not well with the deceased. But they were unable to flag one. At around 8.00pm, [B] used her mobile phone to call for an ambulance. She gave their location as the \u201cmain road of [address redacted], beside the Chinese temple\u201d. After a while, she received a call from the ambulance officer asking for her exact location. This confusion led to a significant delay \u2013 from the ambulance case record, [B]\u2019s call was received at 8.06pm and the ambulance arrived at the vicinity at 8.15pm. However, they were located only at 8.24pm.",
      "11": "On 7 January 2009, Senior Consultant Forensic Pathologist Dr [X] performed the post-mortem examination on the deceased. He certified the cause of death to be haemopericardium due to a ruptured IVC. Dr [X] opined that the rupture of the IVC sustained by the deceased was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and that, based on [B]\u2019s account of events, it was due to the mechanism of kicking, stamping, punching of the deceased by the accused. When asked how certain he was as to when the rupture of the IVC occurred Dr [X] testified that the rupture of the IVC had occurred during the time of the kicking and stamping, as otherwise \u201cno reason why [the deceased] should be becoming weaker and then losing consciousness, unless there were some injury to the brain, for example, there is a head injury. In this case, there was none\u201d. Dr [X] also gave evidence of the numerous external scars and external and internal injuries found on the deceased. He found 22 scars on the ears, face, arm, chest, hip and thighs of the deceased. The multiplicity and pairing of some of these scars, suggested that they could have been caused by pinching. Pinch marks were also found over the right and left labia majora of the vulva (shown in photograph P37) and similar radially oriented lacerations were found on the deceased\u2019s anal rim. Dr [X] opined that the injuries were likely caused on the day the deceased died as the vulva abrasions looked fresh, and the anus was still oozing with blood at the emergency department of the hospital. However these did not contribute to the cause of death. In all, Dr [X] found 58 external injuries \u2013 consisting of bruises and abrasions \u2013 on the deceased. These were distributed all over her body: her scalp, face, ears, neck, arms, chest, back, abdomen, external genitalia, anus, hip, buttocks and thigh. When the deceased\u2019s skin was flayed from her face, it was found that one of the bruises to the deceased\u2019s left cheek corresponded to a large amount of bleeding beneath the skin. \u201cThe soft tissue underneath showed quite severe bruising\u201d and, according to Dr [X], this indicated that the injury was more likely to have been caused by a punch rather than a slap: the extent of the bruising on her left cheek suggested that \u201cthere must have been some blunt force of perhaps more than mild force applied to the face\u201d. The most significant injuries, however, were those on the deceased\u2019s back, where Dr [X] noted extensive bruising of the soft tissues. The extent of the trauma suffered by the deceased is captured in photographs P17 and P42, which are of the extensive injuries to the back of the deceased. Dr [X] also noted the internal injuries occasioned to the victim\u2019s vital organs. He found contusion (ie, bleeding) in the deceased\u2019s caecum and lungs, more on the left lung. The bleeding in the lung explained the nose bleed observed in the deceased shortly before she passed out. The pericardial cavity, which refers to the cavity in the chest where the heart sits, was found to contain 40ml of blood. The flow of blood into the pericardial cavity came about as a result of a tear found on the IVC. It was this 40ml of blood in the pericardial cavity that prevented the deceased\u2019s heart from contracting and expanding \u2013 resulting in a life-threatening medical condition known as cardiac tamponade.",
      "12": "I set out in [9] above [AFR]\u2019s allegation that [B] had used a broomstick to hit the deceased\u2019s back twice. There were two linear bruises on the deceased\u2019s back where [AFR] said the broomstick had struck. Counsel for the Defence submitted that these blows had either caused the rupture or, at the very least, raised a reasonable doubt as to whether [AFR]\u2019s blows had caused the rupture. Dr [X], however, opined that those bruises were not caused by a heavy blow because there was no bruising found in the underlying muscle. Dr [X] also said that the two linear marks showed that there had been only one blow \u2013 the characteristic result of a blow by a rod to the body being a \u201ctramline\u201d haemorrhage that would form as a result of the blood being forced outwards from the line of impact. The bruises were petechial haemorrhages, ie, multiple dots forming a line. A heavy blow would result in two continuous lines rather than a series of dots. Further, a heavy blow would have caused the deeper blood vessels at impact site to bleed and a bruise would have also been evident between the tramlines and laceration. Dr [X] concluded that the bruises on the deceased\u2019s back did not constitute evidence of a heavy blow from a rod. Instead, it showed that the blow had been a light one and as the force had been a dissipated rather than concentrated one, it could not have caused the rupture to the IVC. He also said that if there had been a second blow with the rod, it had not been hard enough to leave a mark. I accept Dr [X]\u2019s evidence in this respect. Even if [B] had delivered the blows to the deceased\u2019s back as described by [AFR], they did not cause or contribute to the rupture to the IVC. I should add that it was [AFR]\u2019s own evidence that [B] had inflicted only light blows with the broomstick and this accorded with Dr [X]\u2019s finding.",
      "13": "[AFR] testified that he had been stressed at that time. He narrated the following facts as background to the incident. He first met [B] in 2005. She was a divorcee with an 8-year-old son. In 2005, the two began cohabiting and they married on 26 December 2007. [B] bore three children out of their union: the deceased, born 28 January 2007; [C], born 27 December 2007; and [D], born 6 November 2008. In September 2008, the family moved into [address redacted] (\u201cthe flat\u201d). At the material time, [AFR] was working in a cleaning company called [name redacted], having been employed there since December 2007, with a break in October and November 2008. He worked the night shift as a cleaner, from 11.30pm to 5.30am. As he worked through the night, [AFR] said that he would try to sleep in the day; however, this was difficult on account of his young children and the small flat they occupied. His monthly pay was about $800. He would hand this sum to [B] who would use it to meet the family\u2019s expenses. $180 was used for rent, conservancy and utilities and $240 was needed for milk powder and disposable diapers for the children, leaving some $380 to see to the family\u2019s remaining needs. This included necessities such as their meals and his transport expenses. As this was quite insufficient, the family was constantly under financial pressure. [B]\u2019s father would chip in to help them whenever it was possible.",
      "14": "It was clear from the evidence, therefore, that in January 2009 [AFR] was facing a difficult time. He had a wife and three very young children to support on a monthly income of $800 that was not sufficient to make ends meet. He had limited his cigarette consumption to eight sticks a day and had switched to a cheap Indonesian brand. The family relied on handouts from [B]\u2019s father. Her mother was unable to help care for the children and the couple had to look after their three girls themselves. [AFR] had difficulty sleeping during the day with three screaming children sharing the flat and it affected his performance at work to such an extent that he was given a warning by his supervisor. He was also looked down upon by [B]\u2019s mother, stepfather and brother as not much of a breadwinner. [AFR] said that [B]\u2019s younger brother, [G], had advised her to marry a more capable person. [G] himself said that there was no love lost between the accused and himself after an incident when he stopped [AFR] from slapping the deceased. There was also evidence of marital discord \u2013 the couple had quarrelled over short messaging services (SMSes) and phone calls that [B] received on her mobile phone from a man called [H]. In one instance, [AFR] had answered the phone and told [H] that he should not be going after a married woman who had four children. I should add that [AFR] is a rather ordinary looking man, of medium height and slight build. [B] on the other hand is tall for a woman. She came to court dressed and made-up attractively. Add to this [AFR]\u2019s inability to support his family and we had the seeds of marital discord \u2013 certainly, [AFR] faced severe pressure on his perceived manhood.",
      "15": "[AFR] underwent an intellectual assessment by Clinical Psychologist Dr [Y]. Dr [Y] testified that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very effortful\u201d during testing, and she felt that he had under-performed on the intellectual assessment as a result. The test, therefore, would not have been fully reflective of his cognitive functioning. Dr [Y] noted in her report that:",
      "16": "When asked in cross-examination to comment on [AFR]\u2019s claim that, during the assessment, he was mentally disturbed by the murder charge against him, Dr [Y] testified that she did not notice any signs of distress during the assessment. Dr [Y] also noted that his adaptive functioning clearly illustrated that he could function independently without supervision. As such, although his overall intellectual function as indicated by the Full Scale Intellectual Quotient is 69 \u2013 ie, between the Mild Mental Retardation and Borderline range \u2013 [AFR] did not in fact show signs of being in that range. As a result of her clinical impressions and observation that [AFR]\u2019s performance during the intellectual assessment was inconsistent with his adaptive functioning, Dr [Y] concluded that his intellectual assessment performance underestimated his current cognitive functioning.",
      "17": "A psychiatric assessment was also conducted of [AFR] by Senior Consultant Psychiatrist Dr [Z] from 15 January to 19 February 2009. Dr [Z] was of the view that [AFR] was not of unsound mind at the time of the offence. In his report, Dr [Z] noted that \u201c[c]linically, it was evident that [AFR] was functional in the various domains of life, and nimble of mind\u201d. In court, Dr [Z] confirmed that, in his opinion, the accused\u2019s adaptive functioning was good by general standards and that the latter was therefore very unlikely to be intellectually disabled or retarded, notwithstanding his Intellectual Quotient (\u201cIQ\u201d) test results. Dr [Z] testified as follows:",
      "18": "In Dr [Z]\u2019s opinion, [AFR]\u2019s actions were the result of a build-up of pent-up emotions and stresses. He had already been riled by the deceased\u2019s first incident involving his cigarettes. On the day itself, the situation brought all of [AFR]\u2019s emotions to a boil and he released it on the deceased. I should add that Dr [Z] was not asked to consider the other stressors \u2013 such as his inadequacy as a breadwinner and loss of face as well as his suspicion about his wife \u2013 disclosed by [AFR]. But I have no doubt that the good doctor\u2019s conclusions would have been the same as they were consistent with his view that [AFR] had pent-up emotions.",
      "19": "The picture that emerges from the above is of a man who is at the low end of the normal IQ range. He is capable of managing his own life, but his ability and drive did not enable him to support a wife and three young children. By all accounts, [AFR] was a loving father to the deceased and other two daughters. He involved himself in the upbringing of the girls and had brought the deceased to the polyclinic for her immunisation treatments. [B] said that he was a loving father to all three girls. Indeed it was [AFR] who had wanted to buy one doll for the deceased and, wanting to be fair to the younger child [C], a second for the latter as well. [B] said that the deceased would run to him when he got home and he would pick her up and play with her. [AFR] often brought the deceased and [C] to the playground. This view was shared by [B]\u2019s mother, [E] \u2013 who also testified that [AFR] was a loving father to all his daughters. [F], [B]\u2019s stepfather, also agreed with this observation. Even though his financial situation was parlous, [AFR] took pains to buy a present for the deceased when her birthday came around. In 2007 he bought the deceased a doll. He also bought a bicycle for her. Although the deceased was observed to have a bite mark on her arm on 5 January 2009, [B] explained that this was due to [AFR]\u2019s playful antics and did not think much of it. Certainly, no one observed any signs that the deceased was distressed by it.",
      "20": "But I should add that there was also evidence that [AFR] had been physically abusive towards the deceased. [G] gave evidence of one occasion in late 2008 when [AFR] and the deceased were at his home. [G] said that [AFR] was playing on his PSP (a computer game device) when the deceased started crying. This caused [AFR] to become angry and he shouted at the deceased to be quiet. He then went up to her and dragged her into a bedroom. [G] heard [AFR] slap the deceased and he went to the bedroom to intervene. They got into an argument over this and thereafter their relationship was strained. It is clear that [AFR] had a tendency of physically abusing the deceased.",
      "21": "The first finding of fact I have to make pertains to causation. I find that [AFR] had caused the death of the deceased. Specifically I find that his acts of beating the deceased had caused the IVC to rupture and this resulted in her death. My reasons for making this finding are as follows. It is clear from the evidence that the deceased was dead by the time the ambulance arrived as she had no heartbeat, no respiration and no blood pressure. Dr [X] had found a 0.5cm rupture to the intra-pericardial portion of the IVC (the part of the IVC inside the cardiac chamber), 0.7cm from its junction with the right atrium. He explained that when the rupture occurred, blood would have leaked into the pericardium \u2013 the sac within which the heart is contained. As blood filled the pericardium, the pressure built up would impede the ability of the heart to pump blood. This, combined with the loss of blood pressure due to the leak and the corresponding lack of blood flowing to the heart, would have caused the heart to fail within seconds. This is consistent with [B]\u2019s account of what happened to the deceased after she collapsed. Dr [X] found many bruises all over the deceased\u2019s body, in particular a set of bruises of about the same vintage on her face, arms and back. The worst blows were to her lower left back. More importantly Dr [X] found that her lungs were contused posteriorly \u2013 ie, there was bleeding from the back \u2013 and that the left lung was more severely damaged than the right. This is consistent with the bruises found on the deceased and indicated that the worst blows were to the left side of her torso. Dr [X] also found that a 5cm length of the deceased\u2019s caecum had been severely contused circumferentially. This would also indicate the amount of force in the blows sustained by the deceased. [AFR] had admitted to slapping and punching the deceased that night; he said that he had slapped the deceased about four times and punched her in a similar fashion. [B] had said that she saw him slap, punch and kick the deceased. It was not disputed that the deceased was quite normal right up to that incident and that, apart from [B] and [AFR], there was no one else present who could have inflicted the injuries found on the deceased. Therefore the only conclusion to be drawn is that [AFR] had not admitted to the full extent of violence he inflicted on the deceased, and that the fresh injuries on the deceased were due to the beating that [AFR] inflicted on her on the night of 6 January 2009.",
      "22": "There was some dispute as to whether [AFR] had used his feet on the deceased \u2013 as [B] had testified \u2013 or, as he claimed, whether he had only used his hands. In my opinion, this dispute was not really relevant. What is material is the degree of force used, although it is arguably easier to inflict a strong blow with one\u2019s foot than with one\u2019s hand. The evidence of Dr [X] on the severity of the bruises provided an idea of the amount of force in each blow.",
      "23": "The Prosecution submitted that under those circumstances, [AFR] is guilty of murder under s 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Act\u201d). It provides as follows:",
      "24": "As the definition of murder encompasses the offence of culpable homicide, it is necessary to first deal with its definition in s 299 of the Act. That section, along with Explanation 2, provides as follows:",
      "25": "There is no evidence that [AFR] had intended to cause the death of the deceased when he beat her up in that manner. Indeed as a father who loved the deceased, he could not have had such an intention. But he did cause multiple bodily injuries to the deceased and there is no question that those bodily injuries, given their quantity and severity, were likely to cause death. I find that when [AFR] inflicted those injuries, he knew or ought reasonably to know that it is likely to cause death. [AFR] had therefore committed the offence of culpable homicide. The issue that I have to decide is whether it falls under limb (c) of s 300 of the Act, ie, it was done \u201cwith the intention of causing bodily injury to [the deceased], and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\u201d.",
      "26": "The primary authority for cases under s 300(c) of the Act is the decision of the Supreme Court of India in Virsa Singh v State of Punjab AIR 1958 SC 465 (\u201cVirsa Singh\u201d). This has been described by the Court of Appeal in PP v Lim Poh Lye [2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (\u201cLim Poh Lye\u201d) as the \u201ctime-honoured pronouncement on s 300(c)\u201d (at [17]) and reaffirmed in Mohammed Ali bin Johari v PP [2008] 4 SLR(R) 1058 (\u201cJohari\u201d). In particular, the following passages from the judgment of Bose J in Virsa Singh were cited by the court in Johari (at [61]) as authoritative on this issue:",
      "27": "The Court of Appeal in Johari summarised the law in the following manner at [62]:",
      "28": "While the analytical basis for s 300(c) of the Act has been clearly set out, the devil, as they say, is in the details, or rather, the facts, as it is not possible to consider any case in the absence of its facts. The facts in Virsa Singh were these. The appellant was about 21 years of age and part of a group of persons whose common intention was to cause grievous hurt only to the deceased. However, by a \u201crash and silly act\u201d he had delivered a forceful blow with a spear that plunged into \u201cthe left side of the abdominal wall in the lower part of the iliac region just above the inguinal canal\u201d and penetrated the whole thickness of the abdominal wall. The puncture wound on the belly measured two inches by half an inch and three coils of intestines had come out. The intestines were cut in six places with digested food flowing out of three of those cuts. The injuries were found to be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The defence in Virsa Singh contended that the Indian Penal Code equivalent to our s 300(c) of the Act required proof that the appellant had the \u201cintention to inflict a bodily injury that was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature\u201d. The Supreme Court of India held that the true question was whether the appellant had the intention to inflict the particular injury on the deceased and that such analysis must be broad-based and founded on commonsense. The following words of Bose J at [11] of Virsa Singh bear repeating:",
      "29": "I do not see those words as imputing to every accused person such a detailed knowledge of every part of the human anatomy that every injury resulting in death, no matter how remote the likelihood or how esoteric the mechanism, would fall within s 300(c) of the Act. What is meant by the use of \u201cbroad-based\u201d and \u201ccommonsense\u201d and \u201ctwelve good men and true\u201d must be that which an ordinary person would view as the intention of the accused person in the circumstances of the case. If the death caused by the injury were within the realm of ordinary human experience, a jury would surely make a finding that there was such an intention. But if the act causing the injury was so remote, so little known or there existed some other circumstances under which it would be impossible to impute such intention to an accused person (such as his mental state), then it could not be said that in inflicting the harm on the deceased, an assailant had the intention to cause that injury. However, as I stated at [26] above, it is impossible to consider this question and the authorities in the absence of the facts in each of those cases. I now proceed to consider them in this case.",
      "30": "In Johari ([24] supra), there was some evidence that the appellant had sexually molested the deceased, who was his stepdaughter aged two years and ten months. But the appellant denied this and the court considered the matter in the absence of molestation. The appellant said, in his statements to the police, that the deceased had refused to stop crying and in order to make her stop he brought her to the toilet and pushed her head into a pail of water until it touched the bottom and held it there for a while. However when she came up, she continued to cry and started struggling. So he pushed her head in the pail again in the same manner. He did this about two or three times. On the last occasion, his mobile phone rang while her head was in the water. He got up and went over to his phone which was connected to the charger at the table. After spending a short time answering the call, he returned to the toilet and found the deceased motionless with her head in the pail. The Prosecution tendered phone records to show that there was no incoming call at the time, and therefore his story about answering the phone could not have been true. In the event, the Court of Appeal did not believe the appellant\u2019s claim that the dunking had only been perfunctory. It found that he had immersed the deceased\u2019s head in water for a considerable period of time resulting in her death by drowning. The Court of Appeal found that it was manifestly clear that such serious injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.",
      "31": "In Lim Poh Lye ([24] supra), the two respondents had, along with a third person, planned to rob the deceased. However, the attempt went awry. They kidnapped the deceased, hijacked his car and forced him to write cheques for one of them cash at the bank. Two of them remained in the car with the deceased while the third went to the bank. When the deceased tried to run away from the car, he was brought back and beaten. He attempted a second escape and they beat him again. This time, though, they not only kicked and punched him but repeatedly slammed the car door against his leg. The deceased continued to put up a violent struggle as the trio drove the car and he was repeatedly punched by the respondents. They drove into a car park and brought the deceased out of the car and put him in the boot. They also applied some chemical on his eyes so that he would not be able to identify them. In the course of the beatings and struggle, the deceased sustained five stab wounds on his right leg and two on the left leg. One of the wounds on the right leg was eight to ten centimetres in depth and penetrated the right femoral vein. This is a major blood vessel and the resultant uncontrolled and continuous bleeding caused the death of the deceased.",
      "32": "The other major cases on s 300(c) of the Act are PP v Visuvanathan [1977\u20131978] SLR(R) 27 (\u201cVisuvanathan\u201d), Tan Cheow Bock v PP [1991] 2 SLR(R) 608 (\u201cTan Cheow Bock\u201d), Tan Joo Cheng v PP [1992] 1 SLR(R) 219 (\u201cTan Joo Cheng\u201d) and Tan Chee Wee v PP [2004] 1 SLR(R) 479 (\u201cTan Chee Wee\u201d). In Visuvanathan, the accused got into a fight with the deceased after a quarrel. The accused had used a vegetable knife and inflicted two stab wounds on the deceased. The fatal stab was on the chest below the left clavicle. The knife had plunged 8cm into the body, cutting through the third and fourth ribs and penetrating the left lung, resulting in a 2cm cut at the anterior surface of the heart. Put simply, the accused had stabbed the deceased in the heart. Tan Cheow Bock also involved a fatal stab with a kitchen knife \u2013 into the deceased\u2019s mouth. The 14cm blade had been plunged all the way in, leaving only the handle outside. The deceased died from haemorrhage. The appellant then made away with jewellery on the deceased\u2019s body and from her bedroom. In Tan Joo Cheng, the appellant and two others attempted to rob the deceased. The appellant used a knife to confront the deceased, but the latter resisted. In the ensuing struggle, the appellant stabbed the deceased on the neck, causing a wound which turned out to be fatal. The stab wound was 5 to 6cm deep and it had incised the right innominate vein. The court found that the stab wound was inflicted intentionally and not accidentally in the course of the struggle. In Tan Chee Wee, the appellant had broken into the deceased\u2019s flat to rob her. In the course of the struggle, the appellant had used a knife to inflict a stab wound on the neck of the deceased and a hammer to hit her on the head many times. One of the hammer blows caused a \u201cgaping, deep stellate laceration measuring 6 x 4cm\u201d on the head which turned out to be the fatal injury.",
      "33": "It is appropriate at this point to consider the decision of the Privy Council in Ike Mohamed Yasin bin Hussin v PP [1974\u20131976] SLR(R) 596 (\u201cMohamed Yasin\u201d). The appellant there had set out with an accomplice to rob the deceased, a 58-year-old woman who was 147cm tall and weighed 51kg. In the course of the robbery, the appellant was overcome with sexual desire and raped the deceased. However after he was done, he discovered that she was dead and dumped her body in the sea. She was found to have fractures of the second to fifth ribs on the left and second to sixth ribs on the right. These fractures had caused congestion of her lungs which resulted in cardiac arrest. The appellant had caused these fractures by sitting forcibly on the deceased\u2019s chest in the course of a violent struggle when she was resisting rape. The High Court and Court of Appeal found him guilty under s 300(c) of the Act. However the Privy Council allowed the appeal. There was some controversy as to the ratio of that case and the High Court in Visuvanathan decided that it was not inconsistent with Virsa Singh ([24] supra). Mohamed Yasin has largely been ignored since, and the Court of Appeal in Tan Cheow Bock made the following comments at [29]\u2013[30]:",
      "34": "It is worthwhile re-examining Mohamed Yasin in the light of the present case. The question arises: can [AFR] be held to have intended to cause the injury (the rupture of the IVC) that resulted in death? The relevant parts of the speech of Lord Diplock in Mohamed Yasin are as follows:",
      "35": "From the passages emphasised above, it can be seen that Lord Diplock entered into the very same inquiry as I have done in the present case, which was to ask to what extent an accused person might be imputed with the knowledge that, by carrying out the acts on the deceased, he would cause injury that would result in death? Clearly, in Mohamed Yasin, the Privy Council took the position that it was necessary for the Prosecution to prove that the appellant knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that by sitting on the deceased in that manner, he would cause her ribs to fracture because, in their Lordships\u2019 view, it was unusual for those injuries to result from such acts. In my view, the finding in Mohamed Yasin was that the injuries on the deceased were such a remote outcome from the point of view of the appellant that it was not sufficient just to prove that he intended to sit on her forcefully to justify the inference that he intended to cause the fractures. In those circumstances, the Prosecution would have to prove that it was within the reasonable contemplation of the appellant that such injuries could be the result of his act of sitting on her.",
      "36": "This issue may be better understood if the concept of \u201cinjury\u201d in s 300(c) of the Act were clarified. Section 300(c) provides that culpable homicide is murder \u201cif it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\u201d [emphasis added]. An accused person commits a physical act which results in \u201cbodily injury\u201d to his victim. The act may be a direct blow on the victim\u2019s body with part of the accused\u2019s body (such as a foot or a fist) or with a weapon. It may also be a non-violent physical act \u2013 such as inducing the victim to ingest a poison. These acts result in bodily injury to the victim: ranging from bruises in the case of a blunt force, to cuts in the case of a stab with a knife, to bodily reaction to the poison. A person is deemed to intend the ordinary and natural consequences of his acts, and so if a person takes a large kitchen knife and stabs the victim in a vulnerable part of his body, then he will be taken to have intended to cause the injuries to whatever vital organs that such an act would be likely to result in. But the thin skull rule cannot apply in the criminal law and a person cannot be imputed to intend all consequences, no matter how remote, of an act done by him on another. Illustrations (b) and (c) in s 300 of the Act support this interpretation. They provide as follows:",
      "37": "The true question therefore is whether the accused intended to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased. In the absence of an admission, the Prosecution must prove such intention from the circumstances of the act. As Bose J had said in Virsa Singh ([24] supra) at [13]:",
      "38": "In the parts emphasised above, there is a clear dichotomy between the act carried out by the accused and the intention to cause bodily injury actually found to be present. There must be evidence that in carrying out the act proved against him, the accused had the intention to cause the injuries that caused the death of the deceased.",
      "39": "Thus in Virsa Singh, the appellant used a spear and pushed it in the region of the abdomen of the deceased with such force that it went in and cut the intestines in six places. Under those circumstances, the law would infer an intention on the part of the appellant to cause the fatal injuries as such injuries would be the ordinary and natural consequences of that act and well within the contemplation of any normal person. In Visuvanathan ([30] supra), Tan Joo Cheng ([30] supra), Tan Cheow Bock ([30] supra), and Lim Poh Lye ([24] supra), the accused persons there had stabbed the deceased persons with knives. The stab wounds were also in particularly vulnerable parts of the body; in Visuvanathan it was aimed at the heart region of the chest, in Tan Joo Cheng it was at the neck. Or they were particularly deep as in Tan Cheow Bock and Lim Poh Lye. In the latter, it was deep enough to cut the femoral vein in the leg. In Tan Chee Wee, multiple blows with a hammer were visited upon the head of the deceased and one of these caused a large crack in her skull. In Johari ([24] supra), the appellant had repeatedly pushed the deceased\u2019s head in the pail of water right to the bottom and held it there for a while before pulling her out. It is certainly obvious to anyone that a person whose head is held under water in that manner is likely to drown. There is no question that in such circumstances, unless the appellants could produce evidence to the contrary, the inference would be that those fatal injuries were intended to be inflicted on the victims as they would clearly be the outcome of such actions. The situations in these cases accord with everyday human experiences and conform with the words of Bose J in Virsa Singh where he said (at [11]) that the analysis should be \u201cbroad-based and simple and based on commonsense: the kind of inquiry that \u2018twelve good men and true\u2019 could readily appreciate and understand\u201d.",
      "40": "Those situations contrast starkly with the present case. [AFR] had used his fist and feet on the deceased. He had hit her until there was severe bruising below the skin in several instances. Indeed, the total effect of the blows was so severe that, although no bones were broken, they caused a haemorrhage in the deceased\u2019s caecum and lungs. [AFR] had rained blows with sufficient intensity to cause a haemorrhage in her caecum and lungs, short of breaking any bones (although it must be noted that the bones of a young child are very flexible). However the cause of death was not the haemorrhage in the caecum or lungs. The cause of death was the rupture to the IVC \u2013 an injury which Dr [X] said was very rare. Dr [X] testified that it was not really known how this kind of injury occurred. He said that injuries of this sort were generally caused by direct penetrative injuries to the IVC, but they could also be caused by blunt force applied externally without penetration. The force would be transmitted into the chest and thereby causing a rupture. Dr [X] explained that the part of the IVC which passes through the diaphragm, a large muscle, is relatively fixed. The portions of the IVC which have entered the pericardium and the right atrium of the heart are, on the other hand, much more mobile. When sudden acceleration and deceleration takes place, the intra-pericardial portion of the IVC may be pulled away from the portion of IVC held down by the diaphragm and it is this relative movement which, if severe enough, may cause a rupture. Dr [X] said that such ruptures are found in motor accidents or falls from heights. He volunteered a figure of 40G as the acceleration that would cause rupture. This would arise in a car crash at 30 to 35km/h. He also raised the possibility of blunt force trauma to the abdomen which would increase pressure in the IVC and as the blood is forced upward, the hydraulic effect concentrated in the intra-pericardial IVC could cause a rupture. From Dr [X]\u2019s testimony, I can only conclude that he could not say exactly how a rupture of this nature, which to his knowledge has only been known to occur in car crashes or falls from heights, could occur in the present case where the deceased was only punched and kicked without any bones being broken. Even though Dr [X] explained that young children had very flexible bones that could not be easily broken, the degree of force used could be seen from the extent of the bruises on the deceased. It was therefore not a case where Dr [X] could easily explain how the rupture had taken place. This is not to say that [AFR] did not cause the rupture; there could not be any other cause as such rupture required considerable force to be applied on the deceased and he was the only source of such force at the material time. The point is the extent to which [AFR] could reasonably have known that the beating he was unleashing on the deceased could have caused the rupture. Even an experienced pathologist with expert training could not be certain as to how it happened in this case. This is quite unlike the cases considered in [36] above, in which the consequences of injuries by stabbing with knives or spears, or drowning in water, are well within ordinary human knowledge or experience.",
      "41": "In deducing intention, the knowledge and intellect of [AFR] were relevant considerations. If, for instance, he was medically trained with knowledge of human anatomy like Dr [X], it might not be possible for him to say he could not have foreseen that his blows could have caused a rupture to the IVC. But he was a poorly educated young man, and \u2013 from the evidence of Dr [Z] and Dr [Y], with, at best, average, but more likely below average, intelligence. This certainly accords with the impression I had from his performance in the witness box. He was someone who needed help to support his family. Therefore his case is rather different from the circumstances in the authorities above which involved injuries that were well within the realm of knowledge and experience of the accused persons there.",
      "42": "One feature of the present case is the disparity in size between [AFR] and his victim. [AFR] weighed 62.4kg; the deceased only about 10kg. Dr [X] had commented that the beating received by the deceased would have been akin to an average adult, weighing 60kg, being beaten by a 360kg person. The Prosecution submitted that this was an aggravating factor on the part of [AFR]. With respect, I do not agree with this contention. This factor explains why a seemingly small blow from [AFR] would cause such severe injury to the deceased. But whether it is an aggravating factor would depend on whether [AFR] was aware that the disparity in size compounded the injury. Indeed, I confess that while it is intuitive that a small child would suffer more when beaten by an adult due to the much larger weight of the latter, the imagery of being beaten by a 360kg person was certainly a revelation to me. I therefore cannot form the view that [AFR] would have appreciated this at the time; indeed, this makes less likely that he was aware of the degree of harm he was inflicting on the deceased.",
      "43": "Another feature of the authorities cited earlier pertains to the motive of the accused. Although it is not necessary to establish motive in proving intention, as the Court of Appeal had said in Johari ([24] supra), it can \u201cbolster the inference\u201d (at [58]). In that case, the Court of Appeal said at [53]\u2013[58]:",
      "44": "Just as motive may be relevant in determining whether a person had the intention to do an act, it must equally be relevant in determining if he did not have any such intention. The deceased was [AFR]\u2019s natural daughter. All of the witnesses who knew the family said that he loved the deceased, even though he had a violent streak and had physically abused her. On the day in question, up to the moment he entered the flat upon returning from his shopping trip, he felt nothing but love for the deceased. He was thinking of her upcoming birthday and had felt that he should buy her a present as he might not have another opportunity to do so. As he entered the flat, he was feeling rather pleased with himself for buying the doll and was keen to hand it to the deceased. This may be contrasted to the circumstances of the cases considered above. In Virsa Singh ([24] supra) and Visuvanathan ([30] supra), there was a quarrel and a fight between the parties. Robbery was the object in Lim Poh Lye ([24] supra), Tan Cheow Bock ([30] supra), Tan Joo Cheng ([30] supra) and Tan Chee Wee ([30] supra). In Johari, the Court of Appeal found that the appellant had sexually molested the deceased.",
      "45": "The question is whether \u2013 in the circumstances of this case \u2013 [AFR] had the intention, when he subjected the deceased to that beating on the night of 6 January 2009, of doing it to the extent of rupturing her IVC. The relevant circumstances may be summarised as follows: on the night of 6 January 2009 when [AFR] entered his flat, he was pleased with himself for having bought a present for the deceased; he was looking forward to giving it to her there and then. Instead, he was confronted with the sight of the deceased playing with his cigarettes, making a mess, and \u2013 above all \u2013 chewing on his tobacco. Only two days earlier, she had done something similar and he had given her a scolding and warned her not to do it again. That warning had not worked; thus, on 6 January 2009, he wanted to teach her a lesson so that she would not do it again. He brought her into the kitchen so that they were less likely to be overheard by the neighbours. He did not start out by hitting her. But when he scolded the deceased, she started to cry and her cries only grew louder. This caused [AFR] to be stressed. He began hitting her. It started with slaps; then, as the deceased\u2019s cries grew more intense with each blow, [AFR] became even more stressed and his blows increased in intensity. His emotions boiled over \u2013 all his frustrations ranging from his inability to support his family (manifested in the deceased eating his cigarettes), the lack of respect shown to him by his wife\u2019s relatives, his insecurities about her infidelity and the reflection on his own manhood, even the prospect of losing face before his neighbours \u2013 and found an outlet in his violence. The blows and cries escalated until [AFR], in Dr [Z]\u2019s words, \u201cfinally tipped over\u201d. It must be remembered that [AFR] was young and poorly educated; he was 27 years old at the time. He had no idea that the blows he inflicted in those moments of frenzy were, relative to the deceased, the equivalent of a 360kg person hitting someone of his own stature. He thought he was beating her to teach her a lesson but lost control in the heat of the moment and went well beyond what was justified. He caused so much injury to the deceased that, apart from the bruises to skin and muscle, her lungs and caecum were contused. Yet, no bones were broken. His unfortunate combination of blows caused a rupture to the IVC in a manner that Dr [X] found unusual. In such circumstances, could a father who loved the deceased, had set out to teach her a lesson, but got carried away in the heat of passion and caused an unusual injury that resulted in her death, be said to have intended to cause that injury when he hit her?",
      "46": "As laid out in Virsa Singh, any enquiry into this question must be broad-based, simple, and founded on commonsense. In the time-honoured words of Bose J, would \u201ctwelve good men and true\u201d form the view that [AFR] had the intention to cause bodily injury, where that bodily injury intended to be inflicted would be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death? I think that a jury would not come to that conclusion; and neither do I.",
      "47": "The finding above would be sufficient to dispose of the matter. However since the defence of grave and sudden provocation (under Exception 1 to s 300 of the Act) was raised by the defence, I shall deal briefly with it. Exception 1 provides is as follows:",
      "48": "The first limb of this exception pertains to whether [AFR] had been deprived of his self-control. The test is a subjective one and the evidence clearly supports a finding that he was so deprived at the time. This comes from the evidence of Dr [Z] as well as from the events leading to the death of the deceased. It is safe to say that no father could have done what [AFR] had done in these circumstances unless he had been deprived of his self-control.",
      "49": "The next issue is whether the acts of the deceased amount to grave and sudden provocation under Exception 1 to s 300 of the Act. This is an objective test. The Prosecution referred me to Johari ([24] supra) in which the Court of Appeal held that the cries from the child victim in that case could not amount to grave provocation. I agree that in the circumstances of this case, the cries of the deceased would not have amounted to grave and sudden provocation under Exception 1 of s 300 of the Act.",
      "50": "In light of the foregoing, I find [AFR] not guilty of the charge of murder under s 300 of the Act. However, I made a finding in [23] above that [AFR] is guilty of the offence of culpable homicide under s 299 of the Act. As it was done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, it is punishable under s 304(b) of the Act. I find that it would be appropriate to exercise my power under s 175(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) to convict the accused under s 299 of the Act. Accordingly I convict him of the offence of culpable homicide under s 299 and punishable under s 304(b) of the Act. I will hear the submissions of counsel for both sides on the issue of sentencing."

      "1": "This is a tragic case of a young couple who had a bittersweet relationship that culminated in a homicide. The appellant, Pathip Selvan s/o Sugumaran (\u201cthe accused\u201d), caused the death of Jeevitha d/o Panippan (\u201cthe deceased\u201d) on 7 July 2008 by stabbing her repeatedly all over her body. The multiple injuries caused were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. He now appeals against the decision of the trial judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d), who found him guilty of murder. The Judge rejected all the accused\u2019s defences, found that he had committed an offence under s 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cPenal Code\u201d) and imposed the mandatory death penalty.",
      "2": "The accused was 22 years old at the time of the offence. He has three siblings; an older brother, a younger brother and a younger sister. His parents were divorced when he was only five years old. After the divorce, the accused and his two brothers lived at the Sri Ramakrishna Mission Boys\u2019 Home from 1992 to 1996. Thereafter, he lived with his maternal grandmother when he was young. He has lived at different points of time with his mother, stepfather and maternal grandparents during the past few years. After completing his \u201cN\u201d Levels he studied electrical engineering at the Institute of Technical Education, but dropped out from his course in his second year. He was then enlisted as a fireman in the Singapore Civil Defence Force and concluded his National Service (\u201cNS\u201d) in January 2007. Prior to his arrest, he was working for his uncle as a movement operator at WeiShen Trading & Services Co Ltd. ",
      "3": "The deceased was 18 years old at the time of her death. She used to work as a kindergarten teacher. At the time of her demise, she was studying for her GCE \u201cO\u201d Levels as a private candidate.",
      "4": "The accused gave the following account of his relationship with the deceased. They met in November or December 2007 through Suresh, a mutual friend. According to the accused, she had up to 16 boyfriends at that time. They became friends but their relationship eventually grew closer. On 10 April 2008, the deceased met the accused\u2019s family members, and later the accused brought her to his sister\u2019s bedroom where they became intimate. This led the deceased to say in Tamil, \u201cNow you have done everything to me, so you are my boyfriend. I hope you will not leave me.\u201d The accused replied \u201c[y]a, obviously you are my girl\u201d. The accused\u2019s family, however, disapproved of their relationship. According to the accused\u2019s mother, the deceased would often ask for money from the accused and the accused\u2019s relationship with his family became strained because of this.",
      "5": "Their relationship hit a difficult patch in May 2008, when the deceased began to meet a male friend, one Kesh, frequently. The accused became suspicious about her relationship with Kesh and obtained Kesh\u2019s telephone number to call him and ascertain the nature of the relationship. Kesh, who said that the deceased had never told him about the accused, claimed that the deceased was interested in him although he already had a girlfriend. He stated that he kissed the deceased and fondled her at a void deck. Immediately after calling Kesh, the accused called the deceased and told her that he hoped that she did not hide anything from him. She replied that she had never hidden anything from him. The accused then told her that he had spoken with Kesh and asked her to meet him at the study corner at Blk 155 Ang Mo Kio, which was near her house.",
      "6": "When they met, the deceased immediately hugged him and started tearing. She admitted that she had lied about her relationship with Kesh and that they had kissed and fondled each other. She then promised him that she would refrain from having any further contact with Kesh. The accused then hugged and kissed her. He forgave her and told her that she was not to repeat the same conduct.",
      "7": "After they made up, the accused and the deceased met regularly and were often intimate. In May 2008, the accused wanted to take up a part-time course in Petroleum and Chemical Process Technology at ITE College East, but he deferred his application because the deceased wanted to retake her GCE \u201cO\u201d Level examination but lacked the financial means to do so. He obtained money purportedly for his own school fees from his grandmother and gave the money to the deceased for her examination fees.",
      "8": "On 25 May 2008, the accused and the deceased quarrelled over an incident, the details of which the former was unable to recollect. On 27 May 2008, the two quarrelled again as the deceased said that the accused only wanted her body and not her heart. On 28 May 2008, the deceased called the accused to inform him that she wanted to visit her sworn brother at Choa Chu Kang and that she did not have any money. The accused then decided to meet her. However, he knew that if he had said that he wanted to meet her, the deceased would not have agreed to this. Hence, he lied to her saying that he would transfer some money into his friend\u2019s account and that she could collect the money from his friend at Admiralty MRT station. He then went to Admiralty MRT station so that he could meet her. At the station, he saw her with her sworn bother, went up to her, grabbed her hand and told her sworn brother to leave. While the deceased was being pulled along, she made a call on her handphone claiming, \u201c[h]ello, hello Police, my boyfriend just kidnapped me\u201d. The accused grabbed her handphone and cut off the line. He pulled her into a taxi and went to his uncle\u2019s house.",
      "9": "After they alighted from the taxi and were walking towards the accused\u2019s uncle\u2019s house, the accused noticed that the deceased\u2019s handphone was ringing and that the caller was her ex-boyfriend, Uthiswaran s/o Hendry A (\u201cUthish\u201d), who lived at Choa Chu Kang. He answered the call, put the phone to her ear and asked her to speak to Uthish. However, the deceased refused. The accused then asked her whether she was going to Choa Chu Kang to meet Uthish. The deceased cried and asked the accused to trust her. She said that if he did not trust her, he could call Uthish himself. The accused then called Uthish and said in Tamil, \u201c[w]hy the fuck you call my girlfriend for\u201d. Uthish replied that he had called the deceased to find out her mother\u2019s handphone number. The accused told Uthish not to call the deceased anymore. He added that Uthish should call him first if the latter wanted anything from the deceased.",
      "10": "Subsequently, the accused and the deceased reconciled at the accused\u2019s uncle\u2019s house and became intimate. While they were having sex, the accused ejaculated into her vagina despite the latter\u2019s protests. The deceased cried and asked the accused whether he would really be responsible for the baby if she became pregnant. The accused said that he would. The deceased also asked the accused if he would eventually abandon her. The accused replied that if he had intended to abandon her, he would not have ejaculated thus and he had done so to show that he really loved her.",
      "11": "Later that day, the deceased made a police report that the accused had raped her. When the accused returned home that night, he saw police officers inside his house and decided not to enter his house in case they were looking for him. He called his friend, Kartigesan s/o Yanamani (\u201cKathik\u201d), and asked him where the deceased was. Kathik informed him that the deceased had attempted to commit suicide. The accused decided not to return home until he found out what was going on. ",
      "12": "Around two or three days later, the accused called his mother, who informed him that the deceased had reported to the police that he had raped her. The accused called Kathik a number of times to find out how the deceased was doing. On one occasion, Kathik passed his handphone to the deceased so that the accused could speak with her. When the accused asked the deceased why she had lodged a police report against him, she cried and said that she was confused and did not know why she had done so. The deceased then promised to withdraw the complaint.",
      "13": "Subsequently, the accused met the deceased\u2019s father, Panippan s/o Sinnappan (\u201cMr Panippan\u201d), and told the latter that he wanted to marry her. Mr Pannipan asked him why he had suddenly decided to marry his daughter. The accused replied that the deceased was pregnant and had lodged a police report against him for raping her. Mr Pannipan responded saying that he would call the deceased and talk to her.",
      "14": "The next day, the accused had a phone conversation with the deceased, who was unhappy that he had seen her father without her. She told him to surrender himself to the Police. On the following day, the accused surrendered himself to the Police and was released on station bail. He was warned not to see or talk to the deceased until the case was concluded. ",
      "15": "Around four days after the accused was released on bail, the deceased called him to find out how he was doing and told him that she needed to go for an appointment on 30 June 2008 for a pregnancy test. They reconciled and started dating again. On 29 June 2008, the accused went clubbing with some friends. However, as he felt guilty about clubbing without her consent, he went to the deceased\u2019s home to apologise to her. On 5 July 2008, they went to Sentosa and spent the night in a tent, where they had sex. ",
      "16": "On 6 July 2008, the accused spoke to the deceased over the telephone and learnt from her that she had influenza and was coughing. The next day, he pretended to be sick so as to be able to take leave and take her to see a doctor. He went to the deceased\u2019s flat on the second floor of Block 157, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5. Instead of entering her house, he decided to check if the deceased was still asleep. He took a chair, climbed onto it and looked into the deceased\u2019s bedroom from the common corridor. To his horror, the accused saw the deceased lying on her bed and kissing a man wearing a red tee shirt and long pants. He was shocked and very angry. He went to the main door, kicked it very hard, and shouted three times in Tamil, \u201c[f]aster open the door\u201d. The deceased came to the door but refused to let him into her flat. He asked her if she was hiding anything from him, but she denied this, and said \u201cwhy do you always have to suspect me?\u201d She also told him that she would call him after her medical appointment at Kandang Kerbau Hospital at 3.40pm.",
      "17": "The accused waited at the staircase of the deceased\u2019s block of flats, hoping to meet her before she went for her medical appointment. However, he fell asleep while waiting. Subsequently, he learnt from the deceased\u2019s friend, Hemavathy d/o V Moganaval (\u201cHema\u201d) that the deceased and her mother would be returning to the flat in over an hour\u2019s time.",
      "18": "While waiting for the deceased to return, the accused called his friend, Balasubramaniam s/o Tangavelu (\u201cBala\u201d) to accompany him. He also decided to buy a knife to force the deceased to tell him the truth about the man in the red tee shirt. In his statement to the police dated 11 July 2008, he recounted:",
      "19": "After buying the knife, the accused bought a \u201cWinnie the Pooh\u201d correction pen for the deceased as he knew that she liked such items.",
      "20": "The accused then met up with Bala, Bala\u2019s girlfriend and Viknesh s/o Rajandren (\u201cVicky\u201d) at a nearby coffeeshop and waited for the deceased. At around 8.00pm, he received a call from the deceased, who asked him to meet her at the void deck of Blk 155 Ang Mo Kio. He told his friends that he was going to meet the deceased and that he would return with her later.",
      "21": "The accused proceeded to Block 155 and met the deceased and her mother. According to the deceased\u2019s mother, the accused asked her for permission to marry the deceased. He promised to give the deceased a good life and said that he wanted to see the deceased\u2019s face every day. He disclosed that he used to be a gang member but had changed after meeting the deceased. He told her that he had started attending church every Saturday because of the deceased. After talking to the accused for a while, the deceased\u2019s mother left him and the deceased alone. ",
      "22": "The events that followed are now set out in the accused\u2019s own words:",
      "23": "The accused testified that when he heard the deceased\u2019s remark ridiculing him he had \u201cnever been this sad\u201d and became \u201cvery, very angry\u201d. [emphasis added] After stabbing the deceased, the accused walked away from the scene. As he left the scene, he picked up some brochures on the floor of the void deck of Blk 154 Ang Mo Kio to wrap the knife. He then boarded a taxi and headed for Woodlands. Along the way, he got out of the taxi and threw the knife into a drain.",
      "24": "The accused telephoned his mother and told her that he wanted to do some shopping in Malaysia. He asked her to bring him a pair of jeans and a tee shirt. After meeting his mother, the accused put on the clothes that his mother had brought and both of them went by taxi to the Woodlands Checkpoint, where he applied for and obtained a document of identity, which enabled him to enter Malaysia. While they were both in Johor Bahru, he left his mother alone at a restaurant, and took a taxi to Danga Bay and spent the night there. His mother eventually returned to Singapore alone. The next afternoon, he made a telephone call to his home and told his mother and other members of his family to take care of themselves and that they would not be hearing from him again because he was going to die. His mother told him to return home because the police, who were at the house, would take her to the police station if he did not return. On hearing that, he asked her to pass the phone to the police officer, and told the latter not to do anything to his family as he would immediately surrender himself.",
      "25": "The accused then went to the Woodlands Checkpoint and surrendered himself to Inspector Mohamad Raffi bin Mohamad of the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. He said to the latter, \u201cSir, yesterday I wanted to run away. I killed my girlfriend because of jealousy.\u201d In his cautioned statement recorded on 9 July 2008, the day after his arrest, the accused stated in response to a charge of murdering the deceased:",
      "26": "Dr George Paul (\u201cDr Paul\u201d), a Consultant Forensic Pathologist, undertook a post mortem examination of the deceased. In his autopsy report, he listed 15 external injuries including bruises, abrasions, and eight stab wounds (of which three were fatal, namely an incised gaping larynx-deep wound (injury no 1), an oblique incised stab wound on the lower part of the left shoulder extending inwards and downwards to the upper outer part of the left side chest (injury no 14), and an oblique incised stab wound in the middle front and outer aspect of left side of the chest (injury no 15)). The other stab wounds were spread out in various regions of the deceased\u2019s body, including her neck, elbow, chest, lower back, and abdomen. The deceased had bruises on her thumbs and abrasions on her thigh, forearm, elbows and chest.",
      "27": "Dr Paul testified that the three fatal wounds were directed wounds, in that they were inflicted with the intent to wound, and were not accidental injuries. Injury no 1 was inflicted with \u201cquite a bit of force\u201d and injuries nos 14 and 15 were \u201cvery forceful injuries\u201d.",
      "28": "The accused admitted to killing the deceased and was charged under s 300(c) of the Penal Code. He relied on the partial defences of provocation in Exception 1 and diminished responsibility in Exception 7 of s 300 of the Penal Code. ",
      "29": "With regard to provocation, the accused claimed that he was in a greatly agitated and vulnerable state of mind and the deceased\u2019s callous utterance that the other man was better than he in bed caused him to lose his self-control. The accused\u2019s counsel, Mr Subhas Anandan, contends that the provocation was grave and sudden such that a reasonable man sharing his characteristics would have reacted the same way. In relation to diminished responsibility, the accused relied on the evidence of Dr Tommy Tan (\u201cDr Tan\u201d), a senior psychiatrist in private practice. Dr Tan said that the accused suffered from attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d) which was as an abnormality of mind induced by a disease of the mind. Dr Tan opined that this made the accused prone to rage outbursts, and that substantially impaired his mental responsibility for causing the deceased\u2019s death.",
      "30": "The Prosecution submitted that both the provocation and diminished responsibility defences were inapplicable. It submitted that the accused was deliberate in his attack and had not lost his self control. Furthermore, it contended that the alleged provocation was neither grave nor sudden. The Prosecution asserted that Dr Tan\u2019s opinion was not credible and relied instead on the psychiatric report of its psychiatrist, Dr Joshua Kua (\u201cDr Kua\u201d), a consultant psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health, who found that the accused did not suffer from any abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility. As such, the Prosecution submitted that the accused should be convicted of murder, punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code.",
      "31": "The High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d), who found the accused guilty of the s 300(c) charge, made the following findings of fact in his grounds of decision, PP v Pathip Selvan s/o Sugumaran [2011] 2 SLR 329 (\u201cthe GD\u201d):\n(a)     The evidence showed that the accused never had any significant functional impairment. He made unremarkable progress through school and NS, and at the time of the offence he had a normal working life. Hence, the defence of diminished responsibility was not made out: at [32].\n(b)     The deceased\u2019s words had an impact on the accused. A reasonable person in the accused\u2019s position would be hurt by her words, but would not be so enraged that he would lose his power of self control: at [36].\n(c)     The accused did not lose his self control as a result of the provocation. While he told Dr Tan that his mind went blank, this was more than a year after the event. He had not said this in his previous statements to the police or in his interview with Dr Kua. In addition, his mental processes did not cease during the attack. While he closed his eyes, he felt the deceased holding onto his hands, he knew that he continued to wield the knife and that she scratched his right hand when he pulled the knife out of her body. He had heard her protestations of love for him. He remembered that he knelt to kiss the deceased, and that he decided to remove her necklace or \u201cthali\u201d which was a symbol of their relationship: at [38] and [39].",
      "32": "The issues in this appeal are whether the accused can rely on the partial defences of provocation or diminished responsibility.",
      "33": "The Penal Code, as a concession to human frailty and weakness, recognises some partial defences to the offence of homicide. The partial defence of provocation, which reduces the offence committed from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, is found in Exception 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code (\u201cException 1\u201d):",
      "34": "It is instructive when considering the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation to bear in mind the views of Lord Macaulay, the draftsman of the Indian Penal Code, on the need to mitigate the consequences of homicide committed in the sudden heat of passion on great provocation; see Notes on the Indian Penal Code, The Works of Lord Macaulay; Speeches Poems & Miscellaneous Writings, Vol 1 (Longmans Green and Co, 1898) at p 120:",
      "35": "This partial defence recognises that individuals can in limited situations be emotionally overwhelmed and offend under conditions of extreme fear, sadness, depression or even jealousy. This is a difficult area of the law that requires the courts to balance contemporary standards and the societal mores of the day with the need to deter violent conduct emanating from rage. It is now trite that there are two distinct requirements for the defence of provocation to apply (see Mohammed Ali bin Johari v PP [2008] 4 SLR(R) 1058 (\u201cJohari\u201d) at [101], citing Seah Kok Meng v PP [2001] 2 SLR(R) 24 at [21]). First, it must be shown that the accused was deprived of self-control by the provocation (\u201cthe subjective test\u201d). Secondly, the provocation must be grave and sudden, and it has to be determined whether an ordinary person of the same sex and age as the accused, sharing his characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, would have been so provoked as to lose self control (\u201cthe objective test\u201d).",
      "36": "To be able to rely on provocation as a partial defence, the accused must first show that he was in fact deprived of self-control by the provocation. The classic direction on what constitutes loss of self-control was given in R v Duffy [1949] 1 All ER 932 where the Court of Criminal Appeal approved of the following formulation by Devlin J in the court below as \u201cimpeccable\u201d (at 932):",
      "37": "Where a killing is premeditated, the question of loss of self-control is, without more, quite irrelevant. In the present case, there was absolutely no evidence that the killing was premeditated. In this regard, it is noteworthy that at the hearing of the appeal, Deputy Public Prosecutor David Khoo (\u201cMr Khoo\u201d) stated that the Prosecution\u2019s case was not that the killing was premeditated but that the accused had brought the knife to the meeting in order to threaten the deceased and use the knife to hurt her if she did not give him a satisfactory answer. This is a significant concession. The accused, who had consistently maintained that he brought the knife to threaten and not to harm the deceased, had previously threatened her with a knife. He explained that in May 2008, when the deceased was staying over at the house of her friend, Kathik, he had threatened her with a knife so that she would not return home late. He testified:",
      "38": "The accused\u2019s evidence that the knife was only intended for threatening the deceased is credibly supported by the facts. To begin with, the accused had arranged to meet the deceased in a public place, which militates against the argument that he had planned to hurt the deceased with the knife. In addition, two of the accused\u2019s friends, Vicky and Bala, testified confirming that the accused was supposed to return with the deceased to meet them after he had spoken to her. Crucially, prior to his meeting with the deceased, the accused had spoken to the deceased\u2019s mother regarding his plan to marry her. According to the deceased\u2019s mother, the accused spoke very softly and politely and promised to take good care of her daughter. In our view, there was no reason to doubt that the accused passionately loved the deceased, and had arranged for the meeting to reconcile with rather than to harm, let alone kill, her.",
      "39": "Having determined that the killing of the deceased was not premeditated, the next question which arises is whether the accused had experienced \u201csudden and temporary loss of self control\u201d as a result of the provocation, which made him no longer a \u201cmaster of his mind\u201d (see [35] above). A close analysis of the accused\u2019s mental state during the killing is necessary to determine both why and whether he had lost self-control. In this context, it is plain that the Judge had erroneously found that the accused\u2019s claim about his \u201cmind going blank\u201d was only made to Dr Tan more than a year after the killing (GD ([31] supra) at [39]). In fact, from the outset, in his statement to the police given soon after he surrendered dated 14 July 2008, the accused had stated that his mind went blank at the material time:",
      "40": "In the same statement, the accused said that when the deceased\u2019s friend, Hema, asked him why he had killed the deceased, he replied \u201cI do not know myself. My mind went blank.\u201d Thus, it appears that the accused\u2019s claim that his mind went blank was not, as the Prosecution initially submitted, and the Judge found, an afterthought. Although the accused explained that \u201cwhat was going through my mind at that time were images of [the deceased] in bed with another man and the other things she had done to me previously\u201d, this does not preclude him from relying on the partial defence of provocation. There is no need for his mind to be completely blank or for there to be automatism when the deceased was stabbed to establish this partial defence. In this regard, the Judge correctly determined that the accused\u2019s mental processes did not cease during the killing (GD at [39]):",
      "41": "However, while the accused appeared at some level of consciousness to be aware of what was happening during the killing, this did not, without more, mean that he did not lose self-control. The human mind has several levels and streams of consciousness.",
      "42": "The crucial question is whether the accused had suddenly lost self-control at the material time, ie, when he wildly stabbed her (see [26] and [42]) due to the perceived provocation to the extent that he was no longer in control of his mind. In our view, the facts strongly suggested that this was the case. The accused had been deeply in love and obsessed with the deceased. Despite a tumultuous relationship that included severe bouts of distrust and recurring episodes of intense jealousy, they invariably reconciled. We accept that the accused had intensely passionate feelings for her. As mentioned earlier, he had again expected to reconcile with her after talking to her despite the distress he felt about the latest perceived indiscretion. He had expected her to beg for his forgiveness as she had done on a previous occasion when he confronted her about her infidelity (see [6]). However, unfortunately, events did not unfold the way the accused had hoped. The deceased was not only unrepentant, but also uttered the taunting remark that the man in the red tee shirt was a better lover than he. Against the backdrop of the prevailing unhappy circumstances, it is plausible that this remark then immediately precipitated the loss of his self-control. It should not be overlooked that the accused was already crying when the taunt was uttered. This heightened emotional state probably made him even more emotional and vulnerable to loss of self\u2010control.",
      "43": "The fact that multiple injuries were inflicted in an entirely random and frenzied manner all over the deceased\u2019s body also suggests that the accused had suddenly lost self-control. As mentioned earlier (see [26] above), there were 15 external injuries over various parts of her body. In his statement to the police dated 14 July 2008, the accused stated thus: ",
      "44": "Much had been made of the accused\u2019s meticulous post-killing conduct. The Judge stated that the accused should have been very alarmed and concerned when he saw the deceased lying on the ground bleeding if his mind really \u201cwent blank\u201d (GD at [22]). However, the approach adopted in PP v Sundarti Supriyanto [2004] 4 SLR(R) 622 at [154], quite correctly indicates that whether post-killing conduct can be taken into account depends on the facts of each case. The conduct of different individuals after they recover their composure (partially or completely) after momentarily losing it can vary infinitely and is contingent upon the existence of incalculable imponderables. It would not be correct to place undue weight on conduct after the offending act in a case such as this. Admittedly, the accused\u2019s actions indicate that he had regained at least part of his composure. After the deceased had fallen unconscious to the ground, he bent down to kiss her once on her cheek and pulled a gold chain, which he had given to the deceased as a symbol of marriage, off her neck as he felt she did not deserve it. However, this does not decisively indicate that he had not been deprived of self-control when he had earlier suddenly in a frenzied manner randomly stabbed the deceased all over her body. Rather, the history of their turbulent relationship indicated that he appeared prone to lose self-control very easily and regain it just as quickly. In response to a query from us, the Prosecution stated that it was not in a position to dispute this view of the accused. It would be recalled that earlier that fateful day, upon seeing the deceased behaving intimately with the man in the red tee shirt, the accused went to the front door of the deceased\u2019s house and impulsively kicked it very hard. Nonetheless, he was able to quickly regain his composure and asked the deceased to let him enter the house. In our view, the circumstances pointed to the conclusion that the accused had likely lost self-control as a result of the provocation and that he committed a crime of passion in the heat of the moment.",
      "45": "To satisfy the objective test, the accused must establish on a balance of probabilities (Vijayan v PP [1974\u20131976] SLR(R) 373 at [31]) that an ordinary person of the same sex and age as the accused, sharing his characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, would have been so provoked as to suddenly lose his self control.",
      "46": "There has been some controversy regarding the nature and application of the objective test. While the provocation must of course be grave and sudden, there is no settled definition of the terms \u201cgrave and sudden\u201d in the Penal Code. In PP v Kwan Cin Cheng [1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 (\u201cKwan Cin Cheng\u201d), this court held (at [72]) that what constitutes grave and sudden provocation will depend on the facts of each case. Bearing in mind that the Penal Code is derived from the Indian Penal Code, Indian authorities continue to be useful to Singapore court in assessing whether a particular provocation is grave and sudden.",
      "47": "As for what is \u201csudden\u201d, a leading treatise, Dr Sri Hari Singh Gour\u2019s Penal Law of India vol 3 (Law Publishers (India) Pvt Ltd, 11th Ed Revised, 2011) (\u201cGour\u201d), declares as follows (at p 2498):",
      "48": "What amounts to \u201csudden\u201d provocation was elaborated on in K M Nanavati v State of Maharashtra AIR 1962 SC 605 (\u201cNanavati\u201d) by the Indian Supreme Court, which stated (at 630):",
      "49": "In Mahmood v State AIR 1961 All 538 (\u201cMahmood\u201d), Oak J had perceptively noted (at 538\u2013539):",
      "50": "We note that the Judge had not made any specific finding on the absence of a sudden provocation. However, in our view, the present case, the requirement of a \u201csudden\u201d provocation had been met. As mentioned earlier, the accused had fully expected to reconcile with the deceased and cement their relationship through marriage. The fact that he earnestly disclosed to the deceased\u2019s mother shortly before the incident his intention to marry her, as well as informed his friends that he was proceeding to meet the deceased and would later join them with her, are significant considerations that militate against premeditation. We pause to note that Mr Khoo acknowledged in the course of argument that the accused had created \u201ca very good impression on the [deceased\u2019s] mother\u201d and that the deceased\u2019s mother testified that she felt the accused was a \u201cfine gentleman and ... she trusted him\u201d. Further, the Prosecution did not question his evidence that he had believed that she would ask for forgiveness like she did on a previous occasion when she was confronted with her infidelity with Kesh. Indeed, Kathik, a witness for the Prosecution, also confirmed that the accused had previously threatened the deceased similarly without any untoward consequences. There was at most only a brief time interval between the provocation and killing as the accused stabbed the deceased immediately after her scornful taunt. Evidently, the deceased\u2019s utterance about the accused\u2019s unsatisfactory sexual prowess was sudden and totally unexpected.",
      "51": "It is clear that both ocular and verbal conduct can constitute provocation. The more vexing question is whether the provocation was grave enough such that an ordinary person of the same sex and age as the accused, sharing his characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, would have been so provoked as to lose self control. Can words of this nature amount to a grave provocation? In determining what is grave, a number of authorities helpfully illuminate the position. In Gour, it is noted (at p 2498):",
      "52": "In Dhanno Khan v The State AIR 1957 All 317, the Allahabad High Court explained:",
      "53": "Who is a reasonable man for the purposes of the objective test? The concept of a reasonable person losing self-control was not clearly articulated by the framers of the Penal Code. When the Indian courts first began applying the concept found in the English common law at the time, they realised that a purely objective test would be inoperable and would create injustice if applied to a multi-cultural, multi-religious, and multi-class structured society like the one in India: see Nanavati at [82] and Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan and Chan Wing Cheong, Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2012) at para 29.42. In Ithinin bin Kamari v PP [1993] 1 SLR(R) 547 (\u201cIthinin\u201d), this court held (at [38]\u2013[39]):",
      "54": "It seems obvious to us that the conduct of the accused must be assessed by reference to the reasonable person with a broadly similar background rather than some imaginary individual travelling on some means of public transport. No single abstract standard of reasonableness can be laid down. This is a fact-centric assessment that has to be made in the context of the established facts. It is now settled that there are at least two types of characteristics which the court can take into account in assessing whether the objective test has been met, namely characteristics affecting a similarly placed reasonable man\u2019s level of self-control and characteristics affecting the gravity of the provocation. However, an accused\u2019s exceptional hot temper alone should not be taken to exonerate an exceedingly violent response. In Director of Public Prosecutions v Camplin [1978] AC 705, Lord Diplock with his customary acuity explained the rationale for this (at 716F):",
      "55": "In similar vein, in Mahmood ([46] supra), Dhavan J penetratingly observed (at 542):",
      "56": "However, with regard to the gravity of the provocation, the court can take into account any of the accused\u2019s personal characteristics which affect the gravity of the provocation. In his seminal article on The Doctrine of Provocation [1976] CLJ 292, Prof Andrew Ashworth clarified the position (at 299\u2013300):",
      "57": "In Attorney General for Jersey v Holley [2005] 2 AC 580 (\u201cHolley\u201d), Lord Nicholls observed as follows (at [11]):",
      "58": "In Holley, the Privy Council also approved of an earlier decision in Luc Thiet Thuan v R [1996] 2 All ER 1033, where it was held that the accused\u2019s mental abnormality, unless it formed the subject of the taunts, is not a relevant characteristic for the purposes of the objective test. In Johari ([34] supra), this court made it clear (at [94]) that the Holley approach is part of Singapore law. At this juncture, it bears mention for completeness that Holley is no longer the cornerstone of the law on provocation in England following the introduction of the partial defence of loss of self-control by s 54 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (c 25) (UK). These changes appear to have been precipitated by long-standing problems with provocation, including the criticism that the defence is not underpinned by any clear rationale and problems with the concept of loss of control in relation to the \u201cslow burn\u201d type of cases (see UK Law Commission, Partial Defences to Murder (6 August 2004); see also UK Ministry of Justice, Murder, manslaughter and infanticide: proposals for reform of the law (Consultation Paper CP 19/08) (2008) at paras 17\u201320). ",
      "59": "In the present case, the accused\u2019s counsel asserted that the fact that he suffered from ADHD, which made him more easily provoked and prone to rage outbursts, should be taken into account in assessing the gravity of the provocation. This argument is untenable as this deficiency had, on the basis of the evidence, no apparent nexus whatsoever to the subject matter of the provocation. Besides this, his satisfactory work history appeared to militate against the likelihood of this being a significant consideration.",
      "60": "We accept, however, that the accused\u2019s mental background may to an extent be taken into account in assessing the gravity of the provocation. In Nanavati ([46] supra), the Indian Supreme Court held at 628 and 630:",
      "61": "In Kwan Cin Cheng ([44] supra), this court agreed (at [50]) that the accused\u2019s emotional state and mental background leading to it could be taken into account in assessing the gravity of the provocation:",
      "62": "It follows that the deceased\u2019s taunt that the man in the red tee shirt was a better lover than the accused ought not to be viewed in isolation, and its effects on the accused must be considered against the background of their strained relationship and the events that transpired earlier that day. It was clear that the accused loved the deceased passionately although their relationship was nothing short of tumultuous. He has both a possessive and obsessive personality and is prone to emotional outbursts. The accused had brought her to meet his parents, met her frequently and often had sex with her. He had also met both her parents, professed his love for the deceased and promised to marry her. Further, he had also manifested his commitment to her repeatedly despite the ever present turbulence in their relationship. It may be recalled that in May 2008, he had wanted to take up a part-time course in Petroleum and Chemical Process Technology at ITE College East but sacrificed his own studies because the deceased had wanted to resit her GCE \u201cO\u201d Level examination but had no money to do so (see [7] above). He went so far as to lie to his grandmother that he needed money to pay for his tuition fees and when the latter gave him a gold bangle to be pawned, he gave the money to the deceased for her studies. He had bought the deceased a \u201cThali\u201d, a Hindu nuptial chain, to symbolise that she was his wife. Even after the deceased made the police report against him for raping her, they reconciled and continued to see each other and again revived their intimate relationship. In fact, on 5 July 2008, just two days before the killing, the accused and the deceased went to Sentosa and spent the night together in a tent where they had sex. In addition, only minutes before killing her, the accused told the deceased\u2019s mother that he wanted to marry the deceased and \u201csee [her] face everyday\u201d. He also said that he used to join gangs in the past but had changed after meeting the deceased and also started going to church every Saturday under her influence. It was clear that, tragically, their lives had become intensely and inextricably intertwined.",
      "63": "The deceased\u2019s taunt ought, in the prevailing circumstances, to be viewed in the context of her previous occasions of infidelity and the fact that the accused had just earlier that day seen the deceased behaving intimately with the man in the red tee shirt on the morning of the killing. In Kwan Cin Cheng, this court noted (at [72]):",
      "64": "We note that the Judge after citing Kwan Cin Cheng and Ithinin ([50] supra) found (GD ([31] supra) at [36]):",
      "65": "In our view, the Judge was mistaken in concluding that all she said was the other person was a \u201cbetter lover\u201d and that the words uttered could not amount to a grave provocation. First, it is far from clear what \u201creasonable man\u201d the Judge used as a yardstick to assess the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the accused\u2019s reaction. Do the words \u201cin his position\u201d refer to his background or the incident alone or both? In our view, the test is a contextual one that must take into account the accused\u2019s background and all relevant circumstances (see [58] and [59] above). Second, here the deceased did not, as the accused had expected, seek forgiveness for her tryst with the man in the red tee shirt, as she had done when the accused confronted her about her relationship with Kesh. Instead, when confronted she had angrily ridiculed him by asserting that the accused\u2019s sexual prowess was poorer than that of the man in the red tee shirt and had sought to justify her infidelity on this ground. This utterance was the proverbial last straw for the accused. Considering the accused\u2019s intensely passionate feelings for the deceased and the fact that he expected to reconcile with her and marry her, it was more probable than not that the deceased\u2019s taunt that the man in the red tee shirt was a \u201cbetter lover\u201d than he transported his passions to such an extent that he entirely lost his self control momentarily. Unlike the Judge, we conclude that in the heat of the moment and in the context of the unfortunate couple\u2019s overwhelming emotional turbulence, an objective review of the facts suggests that the requirement that the provocation be \u201cgrave\u201d in Exception 1 was satisfied. In arriving at this conclusion, we take into account the fact that the Prosecution accepts the accused\u2019s version of what immediately transpired prior to his frenetic stabbing of the deceased. For completeness, we should point out that the Prosecution, quite correctly, has not suggested that proportionality was a key consideration in factually assessing the availability of the defence in a matter such as this. On this point, we need only reiterate what this court stated in Kwan Cin Cheng on this issue, at [69]:",
      "66": "Accordingly, we find that the accused had satisfied both the subjective and objective tests of the partial defence of provocation, and that this reduces his charge from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.",
      "67": "As for the partial defence of diminished responsibility, we found that this was not substantiated. Although Dr Tan had found that the accused had ADHD, we preferred the opinion of Dr Kua, which was strongly supported by the objective evidence. Even if the accused had ADHD, it was not established that it had substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the murder of the deceased.",
      "68": "For the reasons stated, we find on the balance of probabilities the accused has made out the defence of grave and sudden provocation. Accordingly, we set aside the conviction on the charge of murder and convict the accused on a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code. We will hear counsel on the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the accused."

The trial lasted 10 days and took place over three tranches. Although it was not specified in the murder charges, the Prosecution clarified that they were proceeding under limb (a) of s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), which states:",
      "3": "At the close of the Prosecution\u2019s case, I was satisfied that there was some evidence which is not inherently incredible and which satisfies each and every element of the charges as framed by the Prosecution. I therefore called upon Wang to give his defence and he elected to take the stand and give evidence. Wang admitted that he committed the acts that caused the death of Zhang Meng (\u201cZhang\u201d) and Feng Jianyu (\u201cFeng\u201d). However, Wang did not admit that he caused the injuries found on the fingers of Yang Jie (\u201cYang\u201d). There was also some dispute as to the sequence of events leading to the death of Yang. The Defence relied exclusively on the defence of diminished responsibility found at Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code, which states:",

However, both experts disagreed on whether the Wang\u2019s adjustment disorder had substantially impaired his mental responsibility at time of committing the offences. The trial before me essentially involved three issues:\n(a)     whether the elements of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code were satisfied in relation to Wang\u2019s attack on Zhang, Feng and Yang;\n(b)     what was Wang\u2019s state of mind when he killed each victim; and\n(c)     whether Wang qualifies for the defence of diminished responsibility by virtue of his adjustment disorder for each of the killings?",

Based on my findings, I shall then determine Wang\u2019s state of mind when he killed each victim.

      "6": "The background of the parties is not in dispute and can be stated briefly. Wang met Zhang in China in 2005, where they began a romantic relationship. In 2007, Zhang\u2019s daughter, Feng, came to Singapore to study. Zhang came to Singapore with Feng and rented two bedrooms in a flat at Yishun Avenue 11 (\u201cthe Flat\u201d). Zhang stayed in one of the bedrooms (\u201cBedroom 1\u201d) of the Flat, while Feng stayed in another bedroom (\u201cBedroom 3\u201d). The two tenants staying in the remaining bedroom in the Flat (\u201cBedroom 2\u201d) were Yang, and her daughter Li Meilin (\u201cLi\u201d). Zhang, Feng, Yang and Li were Chinese nationals. Li attended the same school in Singapore as Feng. Yang and Li were not related to Wang and Zhang.",

After Zhang\u2019s family members found out about his relationship with Zhang, they objected to the relationship. Some of Zhang\u2019s family members went to Wang\u2019s home and his workplace to harass him, in order to force him to leave Zhang. To avoid the repeated harassment, Wang had to change his place of residence frequently and was unable to continue working as a result. Wang chose to retire early, and he received about RMB 400,000 as retirement funds.",
      "8": "Wang maintained that he continued to love Zhang deeply despite her family members\u2019 objections, and Zhang had loved him in return. Wang stated in court that Zhang was an emotional person. Zhang had allegedly attempted suicide when Wang tried to break up with her in September 2006. Wang also stated that Zhang was difficult to maintain because she led a lavish lifestyle. Even before Wang came to Singapore, his retirement funds were quickly depleted to RMB 50,000 through Zhang\u2019s expenditure and losses in the stock market. Wang\u2019s explanation and description of the tattoos on his body in his statement recorded by the police pursuant to s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cLong Statement\u201d) on 2 October 2008 offered a glimpse into his extremely complicated relationship with Zhang:",
      "9": "In November 2007, Feng secured a place in a secondary school in Singapore. Zhang decided to accompany her daughter to Singapore. Zhang suggested that Wang should come to Singapore to be with her, and promised to help him find work. In that way, they could be together far away from her family members. Before Zhang\u2019s death, Wang came to Singapore three times to be with Zhang. Wang\u2019s third visit to Singapore was on 9 September 2008. During this visit, he stayed with Zhang in Bedroom 1 of the Flat until her death nine days later on 18 September 2008.",
      "10": "Wang\u2019s evidence was that he was subjected to rather bizarre treatment by Zhang during his visits to Singapore. Apparently, Zhang did not allow Wang to leave Bedroom 1 and insisted that Wang had to remain in Bedroom 1 naked. As a result, Wang had to urinate and defecate into plastic bags in Bedroom 1 because the room did not have an attached toilet. Zhang also prohibited Wang from interacting with anybody else in the Flat or leaving Bedroom 1 to use the toilet in the kitchen. Wang stated in his Long Statement recorded on 25 September 2008 that:",
      "11": "Wang gave further details of Zhang\u2019s bizarre treatment of him by stating in his Long Statement recorded on 2 October 2008 that:",
      "12": "The Prosecution did not dispute this aspect of Wang\u2019s evidence. In fact, Li, who appeared as the Prosecution\u2019s witness, testified in court that Wang rarely walked around the Flat, and each time she saw Wang, he kept his head down without ever starting a conversation or establishing eye contact with her or Yang. This aspect of Wang\u2019s evidence was relatively consistent with what he told the two psychiatrists who examined him a year apart, and with Wang\u2019s oral testimony in court. I accept this aspect of Wang\u2019s evidence, viz, Zhang\u2019s bizarre treatment of him while he was in Singapore.",
      "13": "The facts leading to Zhang\u2019s and Feng\u2019s death are also not disputed. On the day of the incident, at about 8 pm, Wang and Zhang had an argument in Bedroom 1. The argument appeared to be triggered by Zhang\u2019s demand for money from Wang to buy crabs for dinner. In response, Wang told her not to spend money this way and to save up the money instead. Zhang became unhappy and started berating Wang using vulgarities.[note: 1] In Wang\u2019s statement recorded pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cCautioned Statement\u201d) on 19 September 2008, he stated that:",
      "14": "It appears that Zhang\u2019s berating of Wang on the evening of 18 September 2008 was, proverbially speaking, the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d. After the argument, Zhang slept at about 9 pm. Wang laid down on his mattress in the same room but could not fall asleep. After about an hour, Wang went into the kitchen and remained there for some time. Thereafter, Wang grabbed a knife (\u201cthe serrated knife\u201d) and walked back to Bedroom 1 and closed the door without turning on the lights. Wang stabbed Zhang in her abdomen area. When Wang stabbed Zhang the first time, she was surprised and screamed \u201cAR ... ...\u201d. Wang then stabbed Zhang repeatedly with the serrated knife until she became motionless. Wang\u2019s evidence on the stabbing was corroborated by the autopsy report prepared by Dr Wee Keng Poh (\u201cDr Wee\u201d)[note: 2], where he identified 48 wounds (most of which were stab or slash wounds) to Zhang\u2019s head, neck, chest, abdomen and limbs. Dr Wee also stated that Zhang died as a result of these wounds, 6 of which were fatal.",
      "15": "While Wang was stabbing Zhang, the door to Bedroom 1 suddenly opened and a person stood at the doorway. Wang recalled seeing a person at the doorway but did not immediately identify the person as Feng. Wang then proceeded to attack the person and stab her repeatedly in the abdomen region with the serrated knife until she too collapsed. Dr Wee found 45 wounds (most of which were stab or slash wounds) on Feng, 12 of which were fatal. Feng also died as a result of these injuries.",
      "16": "The profile of some of the wounds on both Zhang and Feng were consistent with the pattern found on the blade of the serrated knife. The Defence did not dispute the Prosecution\u2019s case that all the wounds found on Zhang and Feng were inflicted by Wang. The details in the above narration were consistent with Wang\u2019s Long Statement recorded on 29 September 2008:",
      "17": "I note that while Wang stated in his Long Statement recorded on 29 September 2008 that he had lost his mind and could not control his emotions when he was stabbing Zhang and Feng, he was able to remember many details extremely vividly. The Prosecution submitted that the requisite mens rea for murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code was established because Wang\u2019s mind was not \u201cblank\u201d when he killed Zhang and Feng. All the vivid details that Wang narrated in his Long Statement were a product of conscious recollection and not reconstruction. Wang could not have reconstructed details such as how Zhang and Feng struggled or screamed just by looking at the aftermath in Bedroom 1. Therefore, the Prosecution submitted that Wang did not \u201close his mind\u201d. The fact that Wang was able to provide such a detailed account of the attacks suggested that Wang was aware of what he was doing when he was stabbing Zhang and Feng. The Prosecution submitted that Wang had intended to kill Zhang and \u201cthe person standing at the bedroom doorway\u201d by stabbing them to death.",
      "18": "I accept the Prosecution\u2019s submissions. The degree of recollection, albeit imperfect at times, suggests that Wang was sufficiently conscious to react to external stimuli and could even feel emotions while committing the acts of stabbing. The acts of stabbing were clearly intentional in nature and Wang had intended to kill both Zhang and Feng at the time when he stabbed them multiple times with the serrated knife. I therefore find that the mens rea for murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code has been established beyond reasonable doubt with respect to the killing of Zhang and Feng. The issue then becomes whether Wang qualifies for the defence of diminished responsibility under Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code.",
      "19": "In relation to the defence of diminished responsibility, I am prepared on the facts of this case to treat Wang\u2019s acts of stabbing both Zhang and Feng as a single transaction because the two incidents followed each other so closely in time that it was extremely unlikely that Wang\u2019s state of mind, his cognisance and understanding of the nature and consequences of his acts, his ability to form a rational judgment on whether his actions were right or wrong and, in particular, his ability to and the degree of exercise self-control would have changed significantly in the interval of time between stabbing Zhang and stabbing Feng. The implication of treating both killings as one transaction would be that any defence that would apply to the murder of Zhang would also apply to the murder of Feng. I shall deal with the defence of diminished responsibility later in my judgment (see [55] \u2013 [900]) where the psychiatric evidence will be additionally considered.",
      "20": "There appears to be some dispute as to what happened after Wang stabbed Zhang and Feng. Unlike the stabbing of Zhang and Feng, to which there were no witnesses, Li (who was the sole survivor of the fateful incident) had witnessed how Wang entered Bedroom 2 to attack herself and her mother and she was able to give evidence in court. I will now scrutinize the forensic evidence and the evidence of both Wang and Li in order to make findings of fact as to what happened, and to draw the necessary inferences about Wang\u2019s mental state when he attacked Yang and Li after killing Zhang and Feng.",
      "21": "In his Long Statement voluntarily given to the police and recorded on 29 September 2008, Wang described the following sequence of events and the emotions he felt at each stage of attacking Yang and Li:",
      "22": "The extract from his Long Statement (above, at [21]) are based on his recollection of the events, and I accept that his recollection might be imperfect and certain facts could have been forgotten by Wang or omitted because his attention was not drawn to them at the time the statement was given. It is also possible that he might have intentionally added false facts, omitted certain true facts or embellished his narration of the events in other ways in order to mitigate his involvement or reduce his culpability, in particular for Yang\u2019s death.",
      "23": "Although some portions of the sequence of events stated by Wang in his Long Statement reproduced at [21] above are not consistent with the forensic evidence and appear to differ from the testimony of Li, I will at this juncture treat Wang\u2019s recollection of the events and the emotions he felt at that time to be true and correct. Without considering Li\u2019s evidence and looking solely on the extract from his Long Statement reproduced at [21] above, I find that even if I were to assume that Wang was not in full command of his senses and full control of himself when he was stabbing and slashing Zhang and Feng in an apparent frenzy, he must have regained sufficient mental faculty to understand the nature and consequences of his actions, to judge rationally the rightness or wrongness of those actions and to exercise self-control over them by the time he first approached Bedroom 2 in order to attack Yang and Li with a sharp weapon. I base my above finding on the following five aspects of Wang\u2019s Long Statement dated 29 September 2008.",
      "24": "For a start, Wang was able to make extremely logical deductions and rationalisations from the facts that he perceived. For example, after seeing two persons standing at the doorway of Bedroom 2, he was able to deduce immediately that they must have been the tenants of the Flat, Yang and Li, although he could not see their faces in the darkness, because they were the only ones occupying that room. From this, Wang could further logically reason that the person who had suddenly appeared at the doorway to Bedroom 1 whilst he was stabbing Zhang and whom he had stabbed earlier in Bedroom 1 must have been Feng, and not Yang or Li.",
      "25": "The next significant aspect of Wang\u2019s Long Statement was that whilst he was stabbing Li, he was observant enough to notice that Yang had run out of Bedroom 2. Shortly after, when Wang was searching the Flat, he had the presence of mind to deduce that the person who escaped from Bedroom 2 was still in the Flat merely from an observation that the sliding door to the balcony had remained closed. This was because the main door of the Flat was situated in the balcony itself and one could only reach the main door by entering the balcony first.",
      "26": "Thirdly, the fact that Wang \u201cpanicked\u201d when he searched the Flat and could not locate the person (Yang) after she escaped from Bedroom 2 gives rise to the inference that he was able, at that time, to fully comprehend the serious consequences that would follow if Yang had indeed escaped from the Flat and raised an alarm, then he might not have sufficient time to escape.",
      "27": "Fourthly, Wang was \u201cshocked\u201d when he found that the person (Li) whom he knew he had stabbed many times in the abdomen region was no longer in Bedroom 2. Wang discovered this on returning to Bedroom 2 after having searched in vain for Yang, who had escaped. Wang understandably used the term \u201cshocked\u201d to describe his emotions and feelings at that time, because it was indeed quite astonishing for a person (in this case, Li) who had been stabbed many times in the abdomen to be mobile and capable of walking out of Bedroom 2 without any assistance.",
      "28": "Fifthly, when Wang then started looking for Li, he was able to deduce that Li was hiding inside the kitchen toilet because he observed that the kitchen toilet door was closed when he returned to the kitchen. His alert mind furnished him with a good logical basis for his suspicion because when he looked for Yang earlier in this same toilet, he had left the toilet door open but it was now closed. Wang decided to break down the locked toilet door. Finding Li inside, he stabbed her again. When Li managed to snatch the knife away from him and held it in her left hand, Wang became \u201cfrighten[ed]\u201d. That was yet another emotional response that he was able to experience during this episode. Wang then retrieved another knife and continued to attack Li. After he had stabbed Li to the point that she was motionless, he came out of the toilet and was observant enough to notice that the units from the opposite block had switched on their lights, when it was dark previously. He even noticed that the residents from those units were looking towards the direction of the ground floor. He also looked down and saw a body lying on the ground floor. He then deduced that the body was that of Yang.",
      "29": "From the exposition above, it is clear that Wang was observant and sensitive to his surroundings. He even had the presence of mind to close the kitchen window, possibly to avoid suspicion that Yang\u2019s body fell from the kitchen window of the Flat that he was staying in. Wang had given another statement to the police that he closed the kitchen window as he \u201cdid not want to attract attention\u201d[note: 3]. In my view, the clarity of Wang\u2019s thought and reasoning processes, the rationalisations and deductions he made, and the relevant kind of emotions he experienced during the entire period after he entered Bedroom 2 to commence his attack on Yang and Li were not consistent with someone who was in a state of loss of self-control or who was having a blank state of mind at that time. Wang\u2019s actions were directed, purposeful and certainly not mindless.",
      "30": "Therefore, based solely on Wang\u2019s own version of the events as set out in his statements to the police, and regardless of Wang\u2019s earlier state of mind when he was stabbing Zhang and Feng, I find that Wang\u2019s mind must have been sufficiently clear and that he was in sufficient control of his mental faculties, his senses and his actions by the time he entered Bedroom 2 to attack Yang and Li, such that he could substantially, if not fully appreciate the nature, consequences and rightness and wrongness of his actions and therefore, he should be made to bear substantial mental responsibility for his acts. Wang was capable at that time of thinking rationally and clearly. He was fully able to experience varied emotions of panic, shock and fear (as the case may be) as he progressed through the various situations he found himself in. I therefore reject the Defence\u2019s submission that Wang\u2019s mind was a complete blank or that he was still in a state of loss of his self-control when he was attacking Yang and Li. By the time Wang started attacking Yang and Li, he had not lost his mind nor had he been unable to control his emotions as alleged in his Long Statements.",
      "31": "The Prosecution disputed Wang\u2019s Long Statement that as he was stabbing Feng, the door of Bedroom 2 opened \u201csuddenly\u201d with Yang and Li appearing at the doorway, which led him to rush immediately towards Bedroom 2 to attack Yang and Li with the same serrated knife that was used to stab Zhang and Feng earlier. The Prosecution\u2019s case theory was that after stabbing Zhang and Feng in Bedroom 1, Wang did not immediately enter Bedroom 2 to attack Yang and Li. Instead, there was a short but significant break in time when Wang entered the kitchen to search for another weapon. There, Wang picked up a metal spatula (\u201cthe spatula\u201d), but subsequently deposited the spatula into the washing machine upon realizing that it was not a sufficiently sharp object to kill a person with. Wang then picked up a chopper (\u201cthe chopper\u201d) and entered Bedroom 2 to attack Yang and Li with the intention of silencing them.",
      "32": "The Prosecution relied on Li\u2019s evidence to dispute this specific part of the sequence of events described by Wang in his Long Statement recorded on 29 September 2008: see [21] above. Li testified that both she and her mother were sleeping in Bedroom 2 when she was awakened by the sound of heavy breathing outside her bedroom which sounded like someone suffocating.[note: 4] Then, the door to her bedroom suddenly swung open and Wang rushed in to attack Li, slashing her on her left cheek. Li retreated and squatted down, and raised both her hands to cover her face. Wang continued to slash Li many times. Thereafter, Wang left Bedroom 2. Apparently, Li was not aware at that time that her mother, Yang, had seized the opportunity to run out of Bedroom 2 whilst he was attacking her and that Wang left Bedroom 2 in order to pursue Yang. When Wang was outside Bedroom 2, Li heard Wang telling her in Mandarin words to the effect \u201cyou do not move, you do not move.\u201d Li\u2019s testimony, if true, would show that Wang even had the presence of mind to give coherent instructions to warn Li not to move out of Bedroom 2 as he embarked on his search for Yang.",
      "33": "I find that Li\u2019s evidence on the whole was consistent with the evidence given by the Prosecution\u2019s expert forensic witness, Ms Lim Chin Chin (\u201cMs Lim\u201d), the Senior Consultant Forensic Scientist at the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore (\u201cHSA\u201d). Ms Lim prepared a Crime Scene Reconstruction Report (\u201cthe Reconstruction Report\u201d)[note: 5] of the entire episode based on the information and findings from thirteen expert reports. Blood smudges containing a mixture of the DNA profile of Wang, Zhang and Feng were found on the exterior door knob of Bedroom 2. This establishes that it was very likely that it was Wang who had opened Yang\u2019s and Li\u2019s bedroom door to enter their bedroom to attack them. Having regard to the locations of the three knife exhibits recovered from the scene of crime (of which only one had unique serrated edges), the photographs and DNA evidence found on the knife exhibits, it was clear that the serrated knife used to kill Zhang and Feng was not the weapon used by Wang to attack Yang and Li.",
      "34": "Only the DNA profiles of Zhang and Feng, as well as that of Wang, were found on the serrated knife. Li\u2019s DNA was never found on the serrated knife. Several of the wounds found on Zhang and Feng bore intermittent small marks that were consistent with the test cuts and test marks from the serrated knife. On the other hand, Li\u2019s wounds were consistent with injuries inflicted with the chopper, on which her DNA was found. This shows that it was unlikely that Li had at any time been stabbed or slashed with the serrated knife. More importantly, the serrated knife was recovered by the police from a location hidden underneath the bed spreads on the floor in Bedroom 1 and it does not appear that the serrated knife had been taken out of Bedroom 1 after Wang had used it to stab Zhang and Feng. The fact that Wang\u2019s DNA was also found on the serrated knife further indicates that Wang had most probably cut his finger in the course of killing Zhang and Feng whilst in Bedroom 1, and not when he was attacking Li in the kitchen toilet as alleged by Wang in his Long Statement recorded on 29 September 2008.[note: 6]",
      "35": "Accordingly, I find that Wang did not use the serrated knife to attack Li in Bedroom 2 and therefore, Wang must have gone to the kitchen first to obtain another weapon before he set out to attack the tenants in Bedroom 2. This again contradicts Wang\u2019s Long Statement recorded on 29 September 2008 that he basically went straight from Bedroom 1 to Bedroom 2, still holding on to the same serrated knife when he crossed over to attack the occupants in Bedroom 2. I also accept the analysis and findings in the Reconstruction Report which states that before the assault on Li started in Bedroom 2, Wang had not only gone to the kitchen. He had also gone into Bedroom 3, switched on the light and opened the wardrobe there. What he was looking for is unclear. He had gone into the kitchen and made contact with the metal turner in the red basket beside the kitchen sink and he had also placed the metal spatula in the washing machine. All this meant that a considerable interval of time had elapsed (ie, since the frenzied attack on Zhang and Feng), which was spent by Wang doing these other things as described above before he embarked on his attack on the tenants Yang and Li, who were pretty much keeping to themselves inside Bedroom 2 with the door closed.",
      "36": "Whether or not Wang\u2019s ability to form a rational judgment, understand his actions or exercise his self-control could be said to have been impaired by the \u201cadjustment disorder\u201d that both experts agree he was suffering from, I find that there was nevertheless a sufficient interval of time elapsing thereafter to enable Wang to regain his senses, his rational judgment and his self-control even if he had substantially lost all of that earlier whilst he was stabbing both Zhang and Feng. This is buttressed by what I have earlier stated at [23] to [30] above about Wang\u2019s state of mind.",
      "37": "In summary, I therefore find that neither Yang nor Li had voluntarily opened the door of Bedroom 2 to find out what was happening outside out of curiosity. They had not intruded into what Wang was doing at that time. They continued to keep to themselves and probably, they were fearful after hearing the commotion and had not even dared to interfere. I accept the Prosecution\u2019s case theory that Wang himself had burst into Bedroom 2 after obtaining a chopper in the kitchen and that there was a distinct and marked temporal break between (i) the time Wang attacked Zhang and Feng; and (ii) the time he entered Bedroom 2 in order to attack Yang and Li. The natural consequence of this finding is that, assuming that the Prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that Wang murdered Yang, Yang\u2019s murder would be considered a separate transaction from Zhang\u2019s and Feng\u2019s murder. Whatever defence that applies to the first two murders does not necessarily apply to the murder of Yang as well, and any defence applicable to the Yang\u2019s murder must be considered separately.",
      "38": "I now make determinations as to the events leading to Yang\u2019s death, whether Wang inflicted any injuries on Yang, and if so, then what was Wang\u2019s state of mind at that time.",
      "39": "In sharp contrast to the level of detail that Wang provided on his attack of the other three victims, Wang did not describe in any detail how Yang fell to her death when he was interviewed by the police and by both the Prosecution\u2019s and Defendant\u2019s psychiatric experts. In my view, this omission could mean one of several things:\n(a)     Wang did not inflict any injuries on Yang and therefore, Wang did not know what happened to Yang until he looked out of the kitchen window and saw a body at the foot of the block of the Flat, from which he could only surmise that Yang had, after running out of Bedroom 2, climbed out of the window to hide from him but had unfortunately fallen to her death;\n(b)     Wang did not know what he was doing when he cut Yang\u2019s fingers and therefore no memory of cutting Yang\u2019s fingers had registered in his mind;\n(c)     Wang knew what he was doing when he cut Yang\u2019s fingers but he had forgotten to mention this aspect of the incident in his statements to the police and psychiatric experts; or\n(d)     Wang knew and understood what he was doing when he cut Yang\u2019s fingers and he was intentionally concealing his knowledge by not mentioning this aspect of his knowledge to the police in order to reduce his culpability.",
      "40": "The answer to the above question must be deduced from the circumstantial evidence in their totality. The Prosecution submitted that Wang knew what he was doing and had deliberately concealed his knowledge. The Prosecution\u2019s case was that as Wang was attacking Li in Bedroom 2 with the chopper, Yang ran outside and into the kitchen. Yang then climbed out of the kitchen window to stand on the narrow concrete overhang, holding on to the laundry pole holders right below the window sill. Worried that she might escape from the Flat and raise an alarm, Wang then came out of Bedroom 2 to pursue Yang. Upon finding Yang on the overhang, Wang used the chopper to cut Yang\u2019s fingers, causing Yang to lose her grip on the two laundry pole holders and to fall down from a height of six storeys to her death.",
      "41": "Dr Wee opined that the incised wounds on Yang\u2019s fingers were not caused by the fall or by the metallic window frame ledge. Dr Wee testified that the incised wounds on the anterior aspect of Yang\u2019s right hand fingers[note: 7] appeared to be defensive injuries, which could have been inflicted when Yang gripped a sharp instrument with her hand, while the sharp instrument was being removed by her assailant. Dr Wee significantly concluded, after having regard to the Reconstruction Report, that the assailant had cut the back of Yang\u2019s fingers on her left hand while Yang was holding on to the two bamboo pole holders outside the Flat. I agree with Dr Wee\u2019s conclusions and I find that the injuries to Yang\u2019s left hand as depicted in Exhibit P466 were neither defensive injuries nor injuries caused by the fall or the window frame ledge.",
      "42": "I also accept the forensic analysis of Ms Lim and the conclusion she reached in the Reconstruction Report based on the vast amount of forensic evidence gathered from the scene of crime that there was no evidence to suggest that Yang\u2019s fingers were cut whilst she was in the Flat. If Yang\u2019s fingers were cut in the manner as shown in Exhibit P466 and Exhibit P467 whilst she was still inside the flat, one would naturally expect to find some of her DNA in the blood swabs taken within the flat, given that there must have been considerable bleeding from those wounds which would have at least left traces of DNA from Yang\u2019s blood on the floor within the Flat as she made her way to from Bedroom 2 to the kitchen.",
      "43": "If Yang\u2019s fingers were cut whilst she was in the Flat, some of Yang\u2019s DNA would have been found on (i) the inner kitchen wall, (ii) the kitchen window frame, (iii) the kitchen window sill areas; and/or (iv) the kitchen sink area, because in the process of climbing out of the kitchen window, Yang\u2019s bloodied fingers would have at least made contact with some of those areas. However, out of more than 300 swabs taken from various interior areas and items within the Flat, as well as the numerous swabs taken from the window and sink areas in the kitchen itself, none of the swabs contained any of Yang\u2019s DNA profile. The absence of Yang\u2019s DNA evidence within the Flat indicates that it was highly unlikely for Yang to have sustained the injuries to her fingers whilst she was inside the Flat.",
      "44": "On the contrary, the analysis of the blood smudges and finger marks found at the interior surface of the window and sink areas in the kitchen revealed that these contained a mixture of the Wang\u2019s, Feng\u2019s and Li\u2019s (but not Yang\u2019s) DNA profile. The presence of Wang\u2019s DNA profile in these areas is consistent with the Prosecution\u2019s case that Wang was at the kitchen window to slash Yang\u2019s fingers when she was standing on the overhang outside the kitchen window and holding on to the bamboo pole holders. The presence of the DNA profiles of Wang, Feng and Li on the interior surface of the kitchen window is consistent with the Prosecution\u2019s case that Wang attacked Yang at the kitchen window after he stabbed Feng and injured his finger at Bedroom 1, and after he stabbed Li in Bedroom 2.",
      "45": "Crucially, Ms Lim stated in the Reconstruction Report that Yang\u2019s DNA profile was found in contact bloodstains and spatter stains outside the Flat, specifically on the exterior wall surface of the kitchen beside the bamboo pole holders and on the third and fourth bamboo pole holders outside the Flat thereby establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that Yang\u2019s fingers were cut when she was still holding on to the bamboo pole holders to steady herself whilst standing precariously outside the Flat on the concrete ledge outside the kitchen window of the Flat. I therefore find as a fact that Yang was not injured with a bleeding wound before she climbed out of the kitchen window. Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find beyond a reasonable doubt that it was none other than Wang who had cut the fingers of Yang, whilst she was holding on to the bamboo pole holders and standing on the concrete overhang outside the kitchen window of the Flat.",
      "46": "I turn now to examine Wang\u2019s state of mind when he slashed Yang\u2019s fingers while she was holding on to the two bamboo pole holders. I have given my reasons at [23] to [30] above as to why I find that Wang had a clear state of mind when he was attacking Yang. The behaviour and actions of an accused immediately before, during and immediately after the criminal acts in question will naturally carry far more weight and have much greater probative value in the court\u2019s determination of the mental state of the accused at the time of commission of his criminal acts than any of his behaviour and actions long before or long after the criminal acts in question.",
      "47": "Although the Third Charge relating to Li had been stood down, the testimony of Li on what transpired after Wang returned to look for her in Bedroom 2 to attack her a second time, which was immediately after Yang\u2019s killing, is relevant because it helps to fortify my findings on Wang\u2019s mental state at the time he killed Yang.",
      "48": "Li\u2019s evidence was that after Wang left Bedroom 2, she had walked towards the door to close it. Wang thereafter returned to Bedroom 2 and pushed her to the lower deck of the double-decker bed. Li saw that Wang was holding a knife. Wang spoke to her in Mandarin, instructing her to \u201cclose her eyes and not to scream\u201d. Wang promised Li that he would not kill her. It would appear from Li\u2019s evidence that Wang had the clarity of mind to practise trickery on Li by promising not kill her. Li agreed but did not close her eyes fully as she did not trust Wang. Li then saw through the slit of her eyes that Wang used one of his hands to hold her shoulder while using the other to thrust the knife towards her body, whereupon she screamed and kicked Wang. Li then ran out of Bedroom 2 and across the living room into the kitchen toilet, where she locked herself in by securing the foldable door. Wang then pursued Li into the kitchen and attempted to dismantle the door by hitting it with a hard object. When Wang ultimately pulled the door apart and entered the toilet, he used a weapon to slash Li repeatedly at her face and neck. Thereafter, Wang said, in Mandarin, words to the effect \u201cI do not chop you anymore\u201d and walked out of the toilet. As Li laid in pain on the toilet floor, she said to herself, in Mandarin, words to the effect \u201cGod, let me go\u201d. At this juncture, Wang returned to the toilet and stabbed Li several more times. I infer from Li\u2019s evidence that when Wang heard Li\u2019s voice and realised that she was not dead yet, he returned to stab her with the aim of finishing her off.",
      "49": "When the police subsequently arrived at the Flat, Wang informed the Senior Investigating Officer, Desmond Tan Hsien Yang, that the three occupants in the Flat did not have any signs of life. From this fact, I deduce that Wang believed (albeit wrongly) that he had succeeded in killing Li. I further infer that Wang had the intention of silencing Li permanently and he was determined to do so as could be seen from the repeated attacks on Li, despite the fact that Li was another innocent party like her mother, Yang. Based on the DNA profiles found on the blood stains on a knife and chopper retrieved from the attached bathroom in Bedroom 3, it would appear likely that Wang had used the chopper and the knife to viciously stab and slash Li at numerous places whilst Li was in the toilet, with the intention of killing her.",
      "50": "I accept Li\u2019s version of events, which was corroborated by the Reconstruction Report. I find that Wang\u2019s actions were consistent with the Prosecution\u2019s case theory that Wang had intended to kill everyone else in the Flat after he killed Zhang and Feng. The fact that Li had survived the attack was completely fortuitous. In my view, Wang stopped stabbing Li further after she became motionless in the toilet most likely because he thought that Li was already dead. I therefore agree with the Prosecution\u2019s case theory that Wang\u2019s intention that night was to silence everyone present in the Flat including Yang and Li because they recognised him and they could provide useful information to enable the police to trace and identify him as the killer of Zhang and Feng. He therefore decided to kill both Yang and Li with the aim of making it more difficult for the police to find leads to trace the killing of Zhang and Feng to him.",
      "51": "In fact, after completing his attack on Yang and Li, Wang made immediate preparations for his escape but before he could do so, the police arrived at the Flat and found him there. Indeed, in his Long Statement recorded on 29 September 2008, Wang described how he packed his bag and collected his documents. The undisputed evidence showed that the bag which Wang was referring to contained his passport and some money. To my mind, these actions were consistent with someone who was trying not only to flee the crime scene, but to flee Singapore and return to China, where it would be almost impossible to trace him. Wang further stated in his Long Statement as follows:",
      "52": "The evidence showed that after Wang had repeatedly stabbed Li in the kitchen toilet, he went to the attached bathroom in Bedroom 3 where he deposited the knife and the chopper that he had used to attack Yang and Li on the bathroom floor, and proceeded to take a bath. The Prosecution submitted that Wang was trying to wash off the bloodstains on his body. After Wang showered, he dressed up, put plasters on his injured finger, packed his bag, took his travel documents, and wore his shoes. In my view, the only logical explanation for Wang dressing up and wearing his shoes in the middle of the night was that he was preparing to flee the crime scene. I therefore find that Wang had the presence of mind to make preparations to leave the Flat and never to return. Such conduct is consistent with that expected of a person who could exercise rational judgment and who was in control of his mental faculties.",
      "53": "Returning to the various possible options I suggested above at [39], I accordingly find that the Prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Wang was fully aware of and understood what he was doing when he cut Yang\u2019s fingers and that he had concealed his knowledge in his Long Statements and in his evidence in court of how he had deliberately caused Yang to fall to her death. I also find that Wang had intended to kill Yang in order to silence her as well. Wang did so by intentionally cutting the back of Yang\u2019s left second, third and fifth fingers with a sharp instrument whilst she was standing on the narrow concrete overhang, to force her to release her grip on the bamboo pole holders, so that Yang would fall down six storeys to her death. This leads me to the finding that Wang also possessed the requisite mens rea for murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code in relation to the killing of Yang.",
      "54": "In the light of my findings, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the offence under s 300(a) of the Penal Code for the murder charges. As the Defence relies solely on the defence of diminished responsibility for all the murder charges, I shall next consider whether the Defence has succeeded in proving on a balance of probabilities that Wang is entitled to rely on such a defence. I note in passing that Wang has to succeed in proving his defence for all the murder charges in order to avoid the mandatory death penalty for murder under s 302 of the Penal Code.",
      "55": "It is well-established that the defence of diminished responsibility has three limbs. The Court of Appeal in Ong Pang Siew v Public Prosecutor [2011] 1 SLR 606 (\u201cOng Pang Siew\u201d) restated at [58] the three-limb test which an accused must satisfy in order to establish the defence of diminished responsibility:",
      "56": "The Prosecution called Dr Kenneth Gerard Koh Wun Wu (\u201cDr Koh\u201d) as its psychiatric expert witness, whereas the Defence called Dr Tommy Tan Kay Seng (\u201cDr Tan\u201d) to provide expert evidence. Both experts agreed that Wang was suffering from adjustment disorder. In fact, both experts were of the opinion that Wang satisfied both limbs (a) and (b) of the defence of diminished responsibility as set out in Ong Pang Siew at [58]; specifically that Wang was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time that he caused the victims\u2019 deaths which arose from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes. In this case, both experts also agreed that the abnormality of mind arose from inherent causes and not from any arrested or retarded development of Wang\u2019s mind. Given the agreement, my role is limited to evaluating whether the experts\u2019 conclusion in this regard flew in the face of proven extrinsic facts: see Khoo James and another v Gunapathy d/o Muniandy and another appeal [2002] 2 SLR(R) 414 (at [65]), and [72] below. Since I am satisfied that it does not, I find that Wang has satisfied limbs (a) and (b) of the defence of diminished responsibility for all three murder charges.",
      "57": "I shall turn next to limb (c) of the defence, which requires me to make a finding as to whether the abnormality of mind substantially impaired Wang\u2019s mental responsibility for his acts. The three-stage test for the defence of diminished responsibility is essentially a composite one: see G Krishnasamy Naidu v Public Prosecutor [2006] 4 SLR(R) 874 at [6]. The Prosecution submitted and I agree that not every accused person who satisfies limbs (a) and (b) would automatically satisfy limb (c); otherwise, limb (c) would be rendered wholly otiose. Therefore, it is necessary for the Defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that Wang\u2019s mental responsibility was impaired at the material time, and the impairment was substantial.",
      "58": "Choo Han Teck J in Public Prosecutor v Juminem and another [2005] 4 SLR(R) 536 (\u201cJuminem\u201d) noted (at [30]) that the phrase \u201csubstantially impairs his mental responsibility\u201d in the defence of diminish responsibility had has no precise definition, and endorsed Ashworth J\u2019s common-sense definition of \u201csubstantial\u201d in Regina v Lloyd [1967] 1 QB 175 at 178:",
      "59": "Choo J\u2019s definition in Juminem was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in Ong Pang Siew at [64], where the court also emphasized that the question of whether or not the impairment was substantial was ultimately a question of fact to be decided by the court based on all the circumstances of the case:",
      "60": "I shall now turn to evaluate each expert\u2019s evidence. The Defence called Dr Tan to support their case that Wang\u2019s adjustment disorder substantially impaired his mental responsibility for all the killings. Dr Tan is currently a Consultant Psychiatrist at Novena Psychiatry Clinic of Novena Medical Center. Dr Tan obtained a Postgraduate Diploma in Forensic Psychiatry in August 1999 from the University of London, and has given expert evidence in court before on many occasions. In terms of both his qualifications and experience, I find Dr Tan to be well-placed to give expert evidence in the present case.",
      "61": "Dr Tan examined Wang on 1 October 2010, about two years after the incident, and in his report dated 10 January 2011, Dr Tan was of the opinion that at the time of committing the offences, Wang was suffering from prolonged depressive reaction (F43.21, ICD-10) or adjustment disorder with depressed mood (309.0, DSM-IV-TR). Dr Tan clarified that both diagnoses referred to the same thing, depending on which classification system one adopted. The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines (\u201cICD-10\u201d) issued by the World Health Organization in 1992 classifies \u201cprolonged depressive reaction\u201d as a form of adjustment disorder at p 149:",
      "62": "Similarly, the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 4th Ed, Text Revision) (\u201cDSM-IV-TR\u201d) classifies adjustment disorder with depressed mood as a sub-type of adjustment disorder at p 679:",
      "63": "For the sake of consistency, I shall refer to Dr Tan\u2019s diagnosis of Wang\u2019s condition simply as \u201cadjustment disorder\u201d. At p 7 of his psychiatric evaluation report, Dr Tan was of the opinion that Wang\u2019s adjustment disorder was caused by the following multiple stressors (which were not in dispute), all of which could be attributed or linked to Zhang:",
      "64": "As a result of the multiple stressors above, Dr Tan opined that Wang suffered from adjustment disorder characterized by a prolonged depressive mood coupled with feelings of helplessness:",
      "65": "Based on the facts that Wang conveyed to him during the evaluation, Dr Tan concluded that Wang\u2019s mental responsibility in causing the deaths of Zhang and her daughter was substantially impaired as a result of suffering from adjustment disorder, because it made Wang more liable to outbursts of violence:",
      "66": "I note in passing that Dr Tan in his evaluation did not immediately conclude that in his opinion the defence of diminished responsibility also applied to Wang\u2019s act of causing Yang\u2019s death. It was only in court that Dr Tan testified that in his opinion, the defence also applied to Wang\u2019s act of causing Yang\u2019s death.",
      "67": "Dr Tan explained in court that he based his opinion that patients with adjustment disorders \u201care more liable to outbursts of violence\u201d on a study of the statistical relation between certain attributes and the risk of violence known as the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study[note: 8] (\u201cthe MacArthur Study\u201d). In the MacArthur Study, researchers studied a sample size of 1,136 individuals and statistically identified factors that were\u2014or were not\u2014related to increases in the risk of violence. According to Dr Tan, one factor that researchers from the MacArthur Study identified would significantly increase a person\u2019s risk of violence was a diagnosis of a major mental disorder:",
      "68": "Relying on a subsequent work that summarized and integrated the principle findings of the MacArthur Study, John Monahan et al, Rethinking Risk Assessment: The MacArthur Study of Mental Disorder and Violence (Oxford University Press, 2001) at p 63, Dr Tan explained that the MacArthur Study separated participants suffering from \u201cmajor\u201d mental disorders from those suffering from \u201cother\u201d mental disorders. Participants suffering from adjustment disorder fell within the latter group of \u201cother\u201d mental disorders. The results of the MacArthur study suggested that the prevalence of violence rate for participants diagnosed with \u201cother\u201d mental disorders was higher than those diagnosed with \u201cmajor\u201d mental disorders, and the difference was statistically significant. Dr Tan concluded that because Wang\u2019s adjustment disorder impaired his mental responsibility by causing him to become more prone to violence, such impairment should be considered substantial; and Wang was therefore in his opinion entitled to the defence of diminished responsibility for the murder charges.",
      "69": "Dr Koh, currently a Consultant Psychiatrist at the Department of General and Forensic Psychiatry, is another well-qualified expert to give evidence of Wang\u2019s condition. Dr Koh examined Wang on three separate occasions: 10 October, 16 October and 10 November 2008. Dr Koh spoke to Wang\u2019s brother twice over the phone. He also interviewed Li, as well as Ms Ler Chui Sia, an acquaintance of Zhang. After setting out in detail significant points in his findings, Dr Koh made the following evaluation of Wang\u2019s mental state when committing the acts of killing in his report dated 15 November 2008:[note: 9]",
      "70": "Based on his observations of Wang above, Dr Koh came to the conclusion that Wang was suffering from adjustment disorder with depressed mood because, in his opinion, Wang\u2019s condition was not sufficiently serious enough to \u201cwarrant a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder\u201d:",
      "71": "After receiving Dr Tan\u2019s evaluation, the Prosecution requested a further opinion from Dr Koh specifically commenting on Dr Tan\u2019s evaluation. In response, Dr Koh provided the following further opinion in a letter dated 14 April 2011 stating that he agreed with Dr Tan\u2019s diagnosis but not with his conclusion of how the diagnosis of adjustment disorder applied to the defence of diminished responsibility:",
      "72": "The principles governing a trial judge\u2019s evaluation of conflicting expert testimony were stated by V K Rajah JA in Sakthivel Punithavathi v Public Prosecutor [2007] 2 SLR(R) 983 at [75]\u2013[77]:",
      "73": "The Prosecution argued that Dr Tan\u2019s assessment methodology appeared to be \u201cless than rigorous\u201d than Dr Koh\u2019s methodology for several reasons. Firstly, although this was not Dr Tan\u2019s fault, Dr Tan only assessed Wang more than two years after the incident; whereas Dr Koh had the benefit of examining Wang barely a month after the incident. The inordinately long passage of time between the incident and Dr Tan\u2019s interview with Wang made it more difficult for Dr Tan to obtain a contemporaneous account of the incident from Wang.",
      "74": "Secondly, the Prosecution argued that Dr Koh\u2019s holistic approach should be preferred over Dr Tan\u2019s approach which was described by the Prosecution to have been \u201cconducted in a vacuum\u201d. Dr Koh had interviewed people who knew Wang and Zhang personally, such as Wang\u2019s brother and an acquaintance of Zhang. Dr Koh also interviewed Li, the sole survivor of the incident who had first-hand testimony of Wang\u2019s demeanour and actions before and after he had killed Yang. Dr Koh arranged for Wang to undergo a computerized tomographic (CT) scan and an electroencephalographic (EEG) examination in order to discern whether Wang was suffering from any physical impairment to the brain. In contrast, again through no fault on his part, Dr Tan did not have the benefit of conducting such an extensive and holistic assessment of Wang. One of the Prosecution\u2019s criticisms of Dr Tan\u2019s methodology was that even though he was given access to evidence such as Wang\u2019s and Li\u2019s statements to the police, Dr Tan had insisted on relying almost exclusively on his interview of Wang and on making independent findings without relying on any of the available contemporaneous evidence to shed light on Wang\u2019s condition. As such, the Prosecution argued that Dr Tan\u2019s evaluation was of limited assistance to the court.",
      "75": "Thirdly, the Prosecution argued that Dr Tan\u2019s heavy reliance on the MacArthur Study was misplaced because, as Dr Koh noted, there were several material differences between the participants of the MacArthur Study and Wang. Besides being based on admissions to acute civil inpatient facilities in several American cities, the participants of the MacArthur Study were of an entirely different age and ethnic profile from Wang.",
      "76": "Lastly, and most importantly, the Prosecution argued that Dr Tan\u2019s opinion appears to fly in the face of objective facts such as Wang\u2019s ability to act methodically and think logically during the attacks, his ability to feel emotions consistent with the events as those events were unfolding, as well as Wang\u2019s evasiveness in court as a witness. The fact that Wang had been able to give coherent and logical instructions to Li during the attack suggested that he was in full control of his mental faculties at the material time. Dr Koh had opined that Wang did not appear to have suffered from any significant loss of self-control at all, and his conclusion was fortified by Wang\u2019s ability in his Long Statements and in court to remember the events and the purposive nature of his actions. Dr Tan, on the other hand, was only able to explain Wang\u2019s actions on the basis that Wang had gone berserk and turned violent because he lost the ability to control himself as a result of his adjustment disorder.",
      "77": "The Defence, on the other hand, argued that on a balance of probabilities, Dr Tan\u2019s opinion should be preferred over Dr Koh\u2019s opinion. Firstly, the Defence argued that Dr Koh\u2019s took an overly-clinical approach towards the issue of substantial loss of self-control, concluding that Wang\u2019s brain did not register such loss because the results for the CT scan were negative. Dr Koh had conceded at trial that the presence of anger (which was undisputed) could lead to the loss of some degree of self-control.",
      "78": "Secondly, the Defence argued that Dr Koh seemed to have placed too little weight on the presence of multiple significant stressors which showed that Wang\u2019s conduct during the incident was truly bizarre and entirely abnormal. Essentially, Dr Koh had underestimated the severity of the impact of those stressors which undeniably existed, and \u201cover-simplified a complex amalgam of issues\u201d.",
      "79": "Thirdly, the Defence argued that looking at the surrounding facts, if Wang had intended to kill Zhang and to silence the rest, it was not necessary for him to inflict more than 40 wounds (many of which were fatal) on Zhang and Feng. If Wang had wanted to kill everyone, a few fatal stab wounds would already be sufficient. However, Dr Koh had failed to take this fact into account. Neither did he explain this exceptional fact in his report.",
      "80": "I shall now set out my findings of whether the defence of diminished responsibility applies to Wang\u2019s murder of (i) Zhang; (ii) Feng; and (iii) Yang respectively.",
      "81": "After considering all the circumstances of the case, I am of the view that both the Prosecution and the Defence had raised valid arguments. I am inclined to agree with Dr Tan that, on a balance of probabilities, Wang was in a state of frenzy when he attacked Zhang. Taking into consideration Wang\u2019s account of his history with Zhang, Zhang\u2019s berating on the evening of 18 September 2008, Wang\u2019s subsequent brooding and his description of \u201cseeing red\u201d, I find that these facts were consistent with the description of a person who had anger building up within him. I find that, coupled with his adjustment disorder, which might have reduced his capacity to control himself and which developed as a result of the multiple stressors, some of which were bizarre, Wang became so angry with Zhang on that evening that he went into a frenzy which was beyond his control and he wanted to kill Zhang. The frenzy manifested and culminated in Wang stabbing her more than 40 times and during this time, his mental responsibility had been substantially impaired by his adjustment disorder. I therefore hold that Wang has succeeded in proving on a balance of probabilities that the defence of diminished responsibility applies to his murder of Zhang.",
      "82": "As for the murder of Feng, I have found at [15] above that Feng unfortunately entered Bedroom 1 while Wang was still in the frenzied state stabbing Zhang. In that frenzied state, Wang was unable to recognize Feng but wanted to kill \u201cthe person standing at the doorway\u201d as well. I base this finding on the similar nature of the attacks on Zhang and Feng, in terms of type, location and number of wounds. Wang\u2019s evidence consistently showed that he realised \u201cthe person\u201d was Feng only after he saw Yang and Li.",
      "83": "In light of my finding at [19] above that the stabbing of Zhang and Feng should be viewed as a single transaction, I find that Wang has succeeded in proving on a balance of probabilities that the defence of diminished responsibility applies to his murder of Feng as well.",
      "84": "Coming to the murder of Yang, I find that there was a sufficient interval of time for Wang to substantially recover his mental faculties and self-control from the time when he stopped stabbing Zhang and Feng to the time when he commenced his attack on Yang. Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that Wang had, on a balance of probabilities, at least regained sufficient control over his mental faculties and was able to exercise greater self-control to get out of his previous frenzied state before he entered Bedroom 2 to attack Yang and Li. In reaching my conclusion, I accord much weight to Li\u2019s testimony, because Li was the sole survivor and could give direct evidence, and her evidence was independently corroborated by the forensic evidence and major points in the Reconstruction Report prepared independently by Ms Lim.",
      "85": "Based on Li\u2019s evidence and Wang\u2019s account, I had earlier found that an interval of time had passed after Wang had stabbed Zhang and Feng during which Wang went into the kitchen to search for another weapon. I also found that Wang had subsequently entered the room where Li and Yang were in, and started attacking them with the intention of silencing them completely and permanently because they were possible witnesses to his killing of Zhang and Feng. Even though Yang and Li did not see Wang stabbing Zhang and Feng, they heard the commotion in Bedroom 1. More importantly, as tenants of the Flat, both Yang and Li recognized Wang. While motive is not an element of the offence of murder in Singapore, the presence of a logical explanation consistent with the evidence of why Wang had proceeded to another bedroom to attack two other victims who were totally unrelated to Zhang supports an inference that, on balance, the subsequent attacks on Yang and Li by Wang were done in cold blood in order to silence them and not in the heat of a frenzied attack.",
      "86": "I accept Li\u2019s evidence that Wang was able to converse coherently with her and could issue calculated instructions for her \u201cnot [to] move\u201d and to \u201cclose her eyes and not to scream\u201d; and to lie to her by promising that he would not kill her to induce her not to struggle so that he could continue with his determined physical attack on Li first in Bedroom 2 and subsequently in the kitchen toilet in order to kill her. Although the large number of wounds inflicted on both Zhang and Feng do indicate that he was in a sort of frenzy and that he had lost his self-control when he killed them, which on balance, I believe, is in part explainable by the stressors and by his adjustment disorder with depressed mood (an abnormality of mind from inherent causes) which substantially impaired his mental responsibility at that earlier time, I am inclined to believe however that by the time he attacked Yang at the kitchen window he had sufficiently regained his self-control and that his mental responsibility for his acts was no longer substantially impaired. The total of about 90 stab or slash wounds on Zhang and Feng must have caused Wang to expend a considerable amount of physical energy and it would have taken him several minutes to inflict. I also believe that there may have well been some cathartic effect and emotional release of the frustration and pent-up anger within Wang when he thrusted the serrated knife each time into the bodies of Zhang and subsequently of Feng, that by the time he was done with stabbing Zhang and Feng to the extent that he did, the frenzy, rage and anger in him would have sufficiently abated. This expenditure of physical energy in the process would have helped to reduce the rage and anger in him. Having killed the very person he was angry with and who had caused him much stress and misery, there ought to have been a considerable degree of release of his bottled up anger and emotions.",
      "87": "Based on the evidence of Ms Lim, Wang had also spent some time doing the following before he killed Yang:\n(a)     walking into Bedroom 3, switching on the light and opening the wardrobe possibly looking for something in there;\n(b)     walking to kitchen, making contact with the metal turner in the red basket beside the kitchen sink and picking up a metal spatula when it was still dark in the kitchen because the light was not switched on (no blood stains found on the kitchen light switch);\n(c)     placing the metal spatula in the washing machine (possibly after realising that the spatula was not a good weapon);\n(d)     looking for another weapon in the kitchen, and this time picking up a chopper, before approaching Bedroom 2 to commence his attack on Yang and Li;\n(e)     attacking Li at the location towards the rear wall area of Bedroom 2 whereupon Yang seized the opportunity to rush out of the room and into the kitchen;\n(f)     leaving Bedroom 2 to look for Yang and warning Li not to move upon realising that Yang had escaped from the room;\n(g)     spending time looking for Yang whom he eventually found hiding outside the kitchen window of the Flat; and\n(h)     cutting Yang\u2019s fingers with a knife, causing Yang to lose her grip and plunge down six storeys to her death.",
      "88": "To my mind, the long series of acts described above (which I accepted happened) all took place prior to killing of Yang and would have allowed Wang an opportunity to cool down. There was time enough for reason to resume its seat, and for Wang to be a master of his own mind and to be mentally responsible for his actions. I would also have expected that after he stabbed Zhang (the very person who had caused him to harbour so much hatred and anger) till she was motionless, that would have assuaged his anger. The subsequent movements around the flat and his actions as described above do not appear to me to be the actions of a man still seeing \u201cred\u201d, still in a rage and in a state of loss of self-control. Clearly, Wang was no longer in a frenzied state by then, nor was he acting in an irrational manner or behaving in an uncontrolled fashion anymore. He knew and understood what he was doing when he cut Yang\u2019s fingers. He was able to exercise his rational judgment and his intention to have Yang killed to silence her as a potential informant and witness was clear. I repeat what I had stated at [23] to [30] and [46] to [52] above to support my finding that Wang\u2019s mental responsibility was no longer substantially impaired by this time. On the contrary, his acts were clearly deliberate, purposeful, directed and methodical.",
      "89": "Having regard to the totality of the evidence, I do not accept the Defence\u2019s submission that by the time Wang slashed the fingers of Yang with the intention of causing her to fall to her death, he had still not sufficiently regained his mental and emotional faculties and his self-control to the extent that his mental responsibility for his actions were not substantially impaired. It is also telling that the Defence\u2019s expert, Dr Tan, conceded in his evidence in court that the fact that Wang was able to give instructions to Li (eg, \u201cnot [to] move\u201d) before he pursued Yang to kill her was logically more consistent with him having regained his self-control rather than with him having a continuing loss of self-control.",
      "90": "For the abovementioned reasons, I find that Wang has not succeeded in proving on a balance of probabilities that the defence of diminished responsibility applies to his murder of Yang.",
      "91": "Accordingly, I find Wang guilty of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code in relation to the Fourth Charge, and sentence him to death.",
      "92": "Given that he had successfully raised the defence of diminished responsibility for his murder of Zhang and Feng, I convict Wang on the lesser charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder in relation to the First and Second Charges.",
      "93": "I shall reserve my sentence on the First and Second Charges pending the outcome of the appeal for the Fourth Charge which shall follow in due course."

Kan J accepted that the convicted person\u2019s offence fell within s 300(c) of the Penal Code. His judgment appears at PP v Galing Anak Kujat [2010] SGHC 212 (\u201cKan J\u2019s judgment\u201d).",
      "5": "Both Galing and the convicted person appealed against Kan J\u2019s decision. On 24 May 2011, the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision against the convicted person. Galing\u2019s appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal which substituted his conviction for murder with an offence of robbery with hurt committed in furtherance of a common intention under s 394 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (see Kho Jabing v PP [2011] 3 SLR 634 at [38] \u2013 \u201cthe Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment\u201d). Galing\u2019s case was remitted to Kan J for sentencing in respect of the substituted offence and he was subsequently sentenced to imprisonment for 18 years and six months and to receive 19 strokes of the cane.",
      "6": "On 30 April 2013, the Court of Appeal confirmed that the convicted person was convicted under s 300(c) of the Penal Code. It allowed his application for his case to be remitted to the High Court for re-sentencing under s 4(5)(f) of the PCAA. The relevant sections of the PCAA are as follow:",
      "7": "Kan J has retired as a judge of the High Court. The case was therefore placed before me for re-sentencing pursuant to s 4(6) set out above.",
      "8": "Briefly, the facts of the case are as follow. The convicted person and Galing are from Sarawak, Malaysia. At the time of the offence, they were both working in Singapore on work permits. On 17 February 2008, both of them had agreed with three of their fellow countrymen, Vencent, Anthony and Alan, to rob two of Vencent\u2019s co-workers at a worksite in Tiong Bahru. However, as the two co-workers had fortuitously left the worksite, the robbery plan was aborted. The five men remained at Tiong Bahru to consume liquor. Subsequently, they left for Geylang intending to find some victims to rob.",
      "9": "At Geylang, the convicted person and Galing walked some distance away from their fellow countrymen and spotted two possible male prey, Cao Ruyin who is the deceased person named in the charge (\u201cthe deceased\u201d) and Wu Jun, walking along a path in an open space near Geylang Drive. Galing assaulted Wu Jun with a belt wrapped around his fist with the metal buckle exposed. The convicted person attacked the deceased with a piece of wood that he had picked up while approaching the deceased. Galing also assaulted the deceased with the metal buckle.",
      "10": "The deceased suffered severe head injuries from the attack and passed away in a hospital on 23 February 2008. The cause of death was certified by a pathologist to be severe head injury. Wu Jun escaped with minor injuries and called the police. When they went to the scene of crime, the deceased was lying on the ground unconscious, with his face covered in blood.",
      "11": "The deceased\u2019s mobile phone was taken away by Galing. The five Sarawakians regrouped at a coffee shop in Geylang where Galing sold the said mobile phone to Vencent for $300. The five of them took $50 each from the sale proceeds and spent the remaining $50 on food and drinks.",
      "12": "When the law provides a maximum sentence for an offence, that maximum sentence is reserved for the worst type of cases. This expression should be understood to be marking out a range and an offence may be within it notwithstanding the fact that it could have been worse than it was (see Sim Gek Yong v PP [1995] 1 SLR(R) 185 at [12]).",
      "13": "Where the law provides for a limited choice of the death penalty or of life imprisonment, neither of the options should be considered the default position. Instead, all the facts and circumstances must be taken into consideration in order to determine if the accused person ought to suffer the death penalty (Sia Ah Kew v PP [1974\u20131976] SLR(R) 54). In that case, which involved kidnapping for ransom, the Court of Appeal opined that the maximum sentence would be appropriate where the manner of the kidnapping or the acts or conduct of the kidnappers were such as to outrage the feelings of the community. The Court of Appeal also held that it would be wrong to take the view that the alternative sentence of life imprisonment should be imposed only when there were some very exceptional circumstances which did not justify the imposition of the death penalty.",
      "14": "The views in Sia Ah Kew v PP were endorsed by the Court of Appeal in Panya Martmontree v PP [1995] 2 SLR(R) 806. This was a case of gang-robbery with murder under s 396 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) which provided that:",
      "15": "The Court of Appeal held (at [66]) that the appellants\u2019 \u201cacts of violence were mercilessly executed and gravely abhorrent in their execution\u201d and \u201cwere amply sufficient to outrage the feelings of the community\u201d. The death sentences were therefore upheld.",
      "16": "During the introduction of the amendments to the law on the mandatory death penalty in homicide cases, the Minister for Law made a statement in Parliament (see \u201cChanges to the Application of the Mandatory Death Penalty to Homicide Offences (Statement by Minister for Law)\u201d, Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (9 July 2012) vol 89):",
      "17": "Relying on the three factors spelt out in [15] above, the Prosecution submitted that the convicted person had acted in a vicious and pernicious manner. The Court of Appeal described his act of raining heavy blows on the deceased\u2019s head, a vulnerable part of the body, as a \u201cviolent assault\u201d. The forensic pathologist had testified that the injuries suffered required \u201cvery severe\u201d or \u201chuge\u201d blunt force from multiple blows. Galing had described the deceased\u2019s head as \u201ccracked open\u201d. Wu Jun had testified that the convicted person and Galing attacked him and the deceased stealthily from behind.",
      "18": "The Prosecution highlighted that the attack occurred in an open public place. The \u201csheer brazenness of the convicted person and Galing, and their gratuitous use of violence would bring disquiet to society. Also, the fact that the brutal attack was prompted only by greed leaves the public in fear that such ill-fortune may befall on them some day\u201d.",
      "19": "The personal culpability of the convicted person was also high. He targeted vulnerable or \u201ceasy\u201d victims \u2013 those walking alone or with only one other person. He armed himself with a piece of wood that he had picked up. Excessive force was used to immobilise the deceased. Even after the deceased fell to the ground facing up and there was blood coming out from his head, the convicted person did not stop his attack but swung the piece of wood at him a second time. There was no provocation by the deceased whatsoever.",
      "20": "The only motivation for this cold-blooded and wanton use of violence was greed. There was scant regard for human life. As the Court of Appeal opined at [37] of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment ([5] supra), such violent crimes cannot be condoned in any civilised society and severe condemnation is required.",
      "21": "The defence of intoxication was raised at the trial and on appeal and was rejected by both courts. Indeed, the law is that self-induced intoxication is an aggravating, rather than mitigating, factor. The convicted person was able to recount the events with details and that showed his mind was clear at the time of the offence despite his evidence that he was drunk. His personal circumstances, absence of previous conviction and remorse do not warrant \u201cexceptional leniency\u201d.",
      "22": "The Prosecution also produced statistics that showed that in the ten years since 2003, there were 25 cases of fatal assault committed in the course of robbery. Out of these 25 cases, 15 involved groups of at least two or more assailants. In 2008, the year in which the present offence took place, there were four cases of fatal assault during robbery by young foreign workers below the age of 30, like the convicted person here. The Prosecution argued that \u201cthe confidence which society has in the safety and security of Singapore can only be upheld by ensuring that those who contemplate such atrocious actions know that those who show no mercy to their victims will receive no mercy from the law\u201d.",
      "23": "A deterrent sentence would be appropriate where the offence was committed with premeditation and planning. Examples of particular circumstances of an offence which may attract general deterrence include offences committed by two or more persons and those which, in addition to harming their immediate victims, also have the wider-felt impact of triggering unease and offending the sensibilities of the general public (see PP v Law Aik Meng [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [25]).",
      "24": "The deceased was 40 years old at the time of his demise. He was from a rural village in China and had come to Singapore to earn a living as a construction worker. His untimely death would doubtlessly bring indescribable grief to his family in China.",
      "25": "For all these reasons, the Prosecution urged the court to re-impose the death penalty on the convicted person.",
      "26": "Counsel for the convicted person relied upon the Ministerial statement set out at [15] above to submit that Parliament\u2019s intention was for the death penalty to be applied restrictively and to a narrower category of homicides and that for cases under ss 300(b) to 300(d) of the Penal Code, the death penalty would not be the appropriate starting or default position. Citing Sia Ah Kew v PP ([13] supra), they argued that the starting or default position in the three categories of homicide cases should be life imprisonment, with the death penalty being the exception rather than the rule.",
      "27": "Counsel for the convicted person also cited cases from India, the United States and South Africa to bolster their arguments at [25] and to conclude that the restrictive approach to the exercise of judicial discretion whereby \u201cthe death penalty is only imposed in situations where the offender\u2019s conduct and/or the offence\u2019s facts are exceptionally heinous is consistent with the international trend\u201d.",
      "28": "It was proposed that the answers to the following two questions would aid in the exercise of judicial discretion:\n(1)     Is there something uncommon about the crime that outrages the feelings of the community and that renders life imprisonment inadequate and calls for a death sentence?\n(2)     Are the circumstances such that there is no alternative but to impose the death sentence even after according maximum weight to the mitigating circumstances of the offender?",
      "29": "Each case has to be considered on its own facts to allow for \u201cindividualised justice\u201d in sentencing.",
      "30": "In the present case, the injuries were intended but the fatal outcome was not. The convicted person only intended to incapacitate or temporarily subdue the deceased in order to carry out the robbery. There was no subjective knowledge of the outcome. The use of weapons by both attackers was purely \u201copportunistic and improvisional\u201d (see the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment ([5] supra) at [35(b)]) and was not premeditated. Further, the piece of wood used was not \u201ca patently deadly weapon such as a knife\u201d. The injuries were inflicted during \u201ca frantic and frenetic fracas\u201d. The deceased was still alive when the convicted person left the scene of the attack and only tragically succumbed to his injuries six days later in the hospital. The conduct of the convicted person and the manner of the deceased\u2019s death were \u201cnot exceptionally brutal, heinous, cruel and/or depraved\u201d and the deceased was not vulnerable due to age or infirmity.",
      "31": "There was no clear and undisputed sequence of events and circumstances surrounding the offence (see the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment at [8] to [10]), including but not limited to the number of times the convicted person hit the deceased. While this was not material for the purpose of a conviction, it was relevant for sentencing. The extent of intoxication, while insufficient to constitute a defence, was not fully and thoroughly explored. There was also no credible objective evidence of the convicted person\u2019s level of intoxication. The death penalty should only be imposed where there was clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. It would be appropriate only in the most aggravated circumstances, for instance, where the manner of the fatality and/or the conduct of the offender are particularly aggravated. The present case did not fit into these criteria.",
      "32": "The personal circumstances of the convicted person were also highlighted. At the time of the offence, the convicted person was at the relatively young age of 24. He has been in custody for about five years without incident. He had no criminal antecedents and had cooperated fully during the investigations. He is single and is the only son in his family. His father passed away while the convicted person was awaiting his trial. His mother lives alone and works as a chambermaid in a hotel in Sarawak. She misses the convicted person terribly but does not have the financial means to visit him during his long incarceration. She has mentioned in her clemency plea to the President of Singapore that the death penalty for her son would also be the death sentence for her. While the deceased\u2019s family could be in a similar position, the loss of another life would only add to the tragedy and sorrow from this unfortunate and ill-fated robbery and would not serve the ends of justice.",
      "33": "On 26 August 2009, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (\u201cAVA\u201d) issued a media release stating that excessive levels of methanol had been detected in one of the alcoholic products consumed by the convicted person prior to the offence. Methanol poisoning was not contemplated nor assessed during the investigations and the recall of the product was not highlighted during the trial or the appeal. The possibility that the convicted person was suffering from a mental and behavioural disturbance from alcohol could not be discounted and should be considered in sentencing because he would not have known about the excessive amounts of methanol present in the drink that he consumed that night.",
      "34": "The convicted person is deeply remorseful about the tragic consequences of his actions. During his incarceration, he \u201chas developed a mark on his forehead as a result of his relentless and continuous Islamic prayers (through the act of bowing his head onto the floor) asking Allah for forgiveness\u201d. If given the opportunity, he intends to locate the deceased\u2019s family to seek forgiveness and to do whatever is possible and within his power to aid the deceased\u2019s family in coping with their lives.",
      "35": "Statistics from the Singapore Police Force\u2019s website show that the number of homicide cases registered a 20-year low in 2012, dropping from 16 cases in 2011 to 11 cases in 2012. Fatal assaults in the course of robbery have also been on a steady decline in the past ten years.",
      "36": "Galing was convicted on a lesser charge. Considering the respective roles and culpability, parity in sentencing would suggest that life imprisonment is appropriate for the convicted person. Further, in another re-sentencing case (Criminal Case No 40 of 2009), where the facts were largely similar to the present case, Chan Seng Onn J imposed life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane on 16 July 2013. The convicted person in that case was 18 years old at the time of the offence in question. No written grounds of decision were given and there was no appeal.",
      "37": "As I was not the trial Judge in this case, I relied entirely on Kan J\u2019s judgment ([4] supra) and the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment ([5] supra) where the findings of fact were concerned. I do not think I should look further into the evidence adduced at the trial and make further conclusions on the facts.",
      "38": "The issue of intoxication was raised and rejected at both levels and it is not open to the convicted person at this stage to revisit this issue. The AVA\u2019s media release was in 2009 and if it was relevant to the defence of the convicted person, then such evidence should have been adduced during the trial or, in any case, at the appeal after leave has been obtained to adduce fresh evidence. It is certainly improper to attempt to introduce the fresh evidence before me during the re-sentencing submissions.",
      "39": "I agree with the Prosecution that there should not be a default position preferring the death penalty or life imprisonment in considering the appropriate sentence under s 300(c) of the Penal Code. In other legislation providing for punishment for offences, the courts have consistently accepted that there is no presumptive preference that the least severe punishment should be the starting or default position. So if a law allows the court to impose imprisonment with or without caning or a fine or both, the court does not begin its inquiry by asking why the offender should not be fined. Instead, it looks at all the circumstances of the case before deciding to impose one or the other or both of the punishments. The Minister\u2019s statement at [15] above also does not show a presumptive preference for life imprisonment as the starting point. Similarly, it would be wrong to regard the death penalty as the starting point and then see if there are factors which would justify the less severe alternative (see Sia Ah Kew v PP ([13] supra)). All the facts of the case should be looked at before deciding which is the appropriate punishment for offences under ss 300(b) to 300(d) of the Penal Code although there are only two stark choices of literally life or death.",
      "40": "I do not find it necessary or fruitful to look at decisions in other jurisdictions as to when the death penalty would be appropriate. Each society must decide for itself what type and degree of punishment it wants and needs in the unique context of its values and the level of development on all fronts, including social, cultural and economic ones.",
      "41": "I do not accept the submission (at [30] above) that the loss of another life (that of the convicted person if the death penalty is imposed) would only add to the tragedy and sorrow and not serve the ends of justice. Such reasoning amplifies the potential grief and sense of loss of an offender\u2019s family while diminishing the already existing grief and loss of a deceased victim\u2019s family. An offender\u2019s life is precious beyond measure to him and his family. A victim\u2019s life is equally precious to him and his family. When a right to life is claimed, it must be remembered that it was the offender who took away the victim\u2019s right to life. While the offender is alive and able to plead his case in court, his victim\u2019s voice can no longer be heard.",
      "42": "After considering all the factors put forward by the parties, I am of the view that the death penalty is not the appropriate sentence for the convicted person for the following reasons:\n(a)     He was relatively young at 24 at the time of the offence in 2008 although he was not as young as the convicted person in Criminal Case No 40 of 2009 (see [34] above).\n(b)     The convicted person\u2019s choice and use of the piece of wood during the attack were, in the words of the Court of Appeal (see the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment ([5] supra) at [35(b)]), \u201copportunistic and improvisational\u201d and not part of a pre-arranged plan. Equally so was Galing\u2019s use of his belt as a weapon.\n(c)     There was no clear sequence of events concerning the attack. There was no clear evidence that the convicted person went after the deceased from behind without warning and started hitting him on the head with the piece of wood. There was evidence that a struggle could have taken place first between Galing and the deceased before the convicted person stopped chasing Wu Jun and returned to assault the deceased.",
      "43": "I therefore re-sentenced the convicted person to life imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest on 26 February 2008. In addition, his acts of violence and the resulting dire consequences warrant that the maximum number of strokes of the cane be imposed. Accordingly, I also ordered him to receive 24 strokes of the cane."

      "1": "This was a tragic case involving the deaths of two women and a teenaged girl, with a second teenaged girl being seriously injured, in a single night of violence in the confines of a rented flat. Providing the backdrop to these events was the passionate, tortured and at times bizarre relationship between the man accused of the crimes and one of the deceased women.",
      "2": "The accused person is one Wang Zhijian (\u201cthe Accused\u201d), a 48-year-old male Chinese national who was 42 years old at the time of the events. The four victims were all female Chinese nationals residing in the same flat. The first deceased is Zhang Meng (\u201cZhang\u201d), who was in a romantic and sexual relationship with the Accused prior to her death. She was 42 years old at the time of her death. The second deceased is Feng Jianyu (\u201cFeng\u201d), the daughter of Zhang and 17 years old at the time of her death. The third deceased is Yang Jie (\u201cYang\u201d), aged 36 at the time of her death. The sole surviving victim of the attacks is Li Meilin (\u201cLi\u201d), the daughter of Yang. She is now 21 years old and was 15 years old at the time of the events. The Accused faced the following four charges:",
      "3": "For convenience we will call these the 1st to 4th Charges respectively. The Prosecution stood down the 3rd Charge for attempted murder and proceeded with the 1st, 2nd and 4th Charges for murder. Although it was not so specified in each of these murder charges, the Prosecution subsequently clarified that it was proceeding under s 300(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Penal Code\u201d), which reads:",
      "4": "The Accused admitted that he had caused the deaths of Zhang and Feng. However, he did not admit that he had caused the death of Yang. For all three murder charges, the Accused relied on the defence of diminished responsibility found in Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code, which states:",
      "5": "In relation to this defence, the psychiatric experts of both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that the Accused was suffering from a psychiatric condition known as \u201cadjustment disorder\u201d. However, the experts disagreed on whether the Accused\u2019s psychiatric condition had substantially impaired his mental responsibility at the time he committed the offences.",
      "6": "Following a 10-day hearing, the trial judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) delivered his judgment on 30 November 2012, reported as Public Prosecutor v Wang Zhijian [2012] SGHC 238 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d). He found the Accused guilty of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code in relation to the 4th Charge and sentenced him to suffer death. However, in relation to the 1st and 2nd Charges, the Judge found the Accused had succeeded in raising the defence of diminished responsibility. Hence the Accused was convicted of the lesser offences of culpable homicide not amounting to murder in relation to the 1st and 2nd Charges. The Judge reserved passing sentence on the 1st and 2nd Charges pending the outcome of any appeal that might be lodged by either or both the Prosecution and the Accused against his decision. In the event, cross appeals were lodged: Criminal Appeal No 12 of 2012 (\u201cCCA 12/2012\u201d) is the Prosecution\u2019s appeal against the acquittal of the Accused on the 1st and 2nd Charges of the murder offences, and Criminal Appeal No 4 of 2013 (\u201cCCA 4/2013\u201d) is the Accused\u2019s appeal against the conviction and sentence imposed in respect of the 4th Charge.",
      "7": "The background facts to these appeals are set out in the Judgment. In brief, the Accused first met Zhang in China in 2005, and they soon began a romantic relationship. In 2007, Zhang\u2019s daughter Feng came to Singapore to study, and she was accompanied by Zhang. They rented two bedrooms in a three-bedroom flat at Yishun Avenue 11 (\u201cthe Flat\u201d). Zhang and Feng stayed in the master bedroom (\u201cBedroom 3\u201d) of the Flat, which had an attached bathroom. The other bedroom (Bedroom 1) was used from time to time by Zhang\u2019s friends and relatives. It was occupied by the Accused when he made his three trips to Singapore (see [9] below) to visit Zhang between July and September 2008. Yang and her daughter Li were the tenants of the remaining bedroom in the Flat (\u201cBedroom 2\u201d) and were unrelated to the Accused and Zhang.",
      "8": "As stated, the Accused and Zhang began a relationship in China and the Accused\u2019s undisputed evidence was that this relationship was not a smooth one as she was then married. When Zhang\u2019s family found out about her association with the Accused, they objected to it. Some of Zhang\u2019s family members even went to the Accused\u2019s home and workplace to harass him. The Accused also recounted an incident where he was confronted by Zhang\u2019s family members and received death threats from her brother. To avoid such harassments, the Accused had to change his place of residence frequently. He was also unable to continue working as a result. He chose to retire early and received over RMB$300,000 (about S$60,000) as retirement funds.",
      "9": "The Accused maintained that he continued to love Zhang despite her family members\u2019 objections and her \u201cextreme\u201d character. Unsurprisingly, their relationship was tumultuous. According to the Accused, Zhang attempted suicide on two different occasions when he tried to break up with her. The intensity of their relationship is evidenced by the following extract from the Accused\u2019s statement (\u201cthe Long Statement\u201d) recorded by the police pursuant to s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe CPC\u201d) on 24 September 2008:",
      "10": "The Accused\u2019s explanation of the tattoos on his body in his Long Statement recorded on 2 October 2008 also provides a glimpse into their tortured relationship:",
      "11": "The Accused stated that Zhang was difficult to maintain because she liked a lavish lifestyle. With Zhang\u2019s expenditure and his own losses in the stock market, his retirement funds were soon reduced to RMB$50,000.",
      "12": "In November 2007, Zhang\u2019s daughter, Feng, secured a place in a secondary school in Singapore. Zhang decided to accompany her to Singapore. She suggested that the Accused come to Singapore to be with her, and promised to help him find work. Before Zhang\u2019s death, the Accused visited Singapore three times. The Accused\u2019s third visit to Singapore was on 9 September 2008. During this visit, he stayed in Bedroom 1 until the fateful events nine days later on 18 September 2008.",
      "13": "The Accused\u2019s evidence was that he was subjected to humiliating and abusive treatment by Zhang during his second and third trips to Singapore. Zhang would not allow the Accused to leave Bedroom 1 when anyone else was in the Flat. As a result, the Accused claimed that on several occasions he had to urinate and defecate into plastic bags in Bedroom 1 because the room did not have an attached toilet. Zhang also prohibited him from interacting with anybody else in the Flat. According to the Accused, he was made to prepare meals for Zhang and Feng but was only allowed to eat their leftovers afterwards. He stated in his Long Statement recorded on 25 September 2008 that:",
      "14": "The Prosecution did not dispute this aspect of the Accused\u2019s evidence. In fact, the sole surviving victim, Li, who appeared as the Prosecution\u2019s witness, testified that the Accused rarely walked around the Flat, and that each time she saw the Accused, he kept his head down and did not acknowledge her presence. She also said that the Accused \u201cdoesn\u2019t go to the toilet\u201d. The Judge accepted this aspect of the Accused\u2019s evidence and noted that it was relatively consistent with what he had told the two psychiatrists who had examined him about two years apart, as well as his oral testimony in court (see the Judgment at [12]).",
      "15": "According to the Accused, he was aggrieved by Zhang\u2019s treatment of him but did not stand up to her out of love and fear. He said Zhang would scold him, humiliate him and hit or bite him when she was angry. When queried about a bruise on his chest and scratch marks near his groin region, the Accused responded, in his Long Statement recorded on 2 October 2008, as follows:",
      "16": "When asked why he stayed with Zhang and came to Singapore yet again when their relationship was so unhappy, the Accused said he felt he was \u201cher private property\u201d and that Zhang would harass his family members when she could not find him.",
      "17": "We now turn to the events of 18 September 2008. The facts leading to Zhang\u2019s and Feng\u2019s deaths are not disputed. As the Judge found (at [13] of the Judgment), on the day of the incident, the Accused and Zhang had an argument in Bedroom 1. The Judge said that the argument took place at 8pm but the Accused in his Long Statement recorded on 25 September 2008 said that it happened after 9pm; the difference is however not material. The argument was apparently triggered by Zhang\u2019s demand for money from the Accused to buy crabs for dinner. In response, the Accused told her not to spend money wastefully and counselled her to save the money instead. As a result, Zhang became angry and started berating the Accused with vulgarities. In the Accused\u2019s statement recorded by the police pursuant to s 122(6) of the CPC (\u201cthe Cautioned Statement\u201d) on 19 September 2008, he stated that:",
      "18": "The Judge observed (at [14] of the Judgment) that Zhang\u2019s berating of the Accused on the evening of 18 September 2008 was, proverbially speaking, the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d. After the argument, Zhang went to sleep. However, the Accused, while lying down on his mattress in the same room, could not fall asleep. Instead, he was angry with Zhang for what had happened. In his Long Statement recorded on 25 September 2008, he stated:",
      "19": "Thus on the Accused\u2019s own account he lay brooding for some time \u2013 around an hour and perhaps more \u2013 after which he went to the kitchen, grabbed a knife (\u201cthe serrated knife\u201d) and walked back to Bedroom 1. The Judge found that upon entering Bedroom 1 the Accused closed the door without turning on the lights. He went over to where Zhang was sleeping and stabbed her in her abdomen causing her to scream. The Accused continued to stab Zhang repeatedly with the serrated knife until she became motionless. The autopsy report prepared by the Forensic Pathologist, Dr Wee Keng Poh (\u201cDr Wee\u201d) identified 48 knife wounds to Zhang\u2019s head, neck, chest, abdomen and limbs. Dr Wee stated that Zhang died as a result of these wounds, six of which were fatal.",
      "20": "While the Accused was stabbing Zhang, the door to Bedroom 1 opened and a person stood at the doorway. The Accused recalled seeing a person at the doorway of Bedroom 1 but stated that he did not immediately identify the person as Feng. He recalled the person saying something, but could not make out the words. The Accused proceeded to attack the person at the doorway and stab her repeatedly in the abdomen until she too collapsed beside her mother in Bedroom 1. Dr Wee found 45 knife wounds on Feng, 12 of which were fatal. Feng died as a result of these injuries.",
      "21": "It was clear that the Accused had committed the actus reus of murder in respect of Zhang and Feng; the Defence did not dispute the Prosecution\u2019s case that all the wounds found on them were inflicted by the Accused in Bedroom 1. The above account of the events is also consistent with the Accused\u2019s Long Statement recorded on 29 September 2008 where he narrated his attacks on Zhang and Feng with vivid detail:",
      "22": "The actus reus having been established, the Judge held that the mens rea for murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code had also been established beyond reasonable doubt with respect to the killing of Zhang and Feng, ie, that the Accused had intended to kill them. He found that although the Accused stated in his Long Statement recorded on 29 September 2008 that he had lost his mind and could not control his emotions when he was stabbing Zhang and Feng, he was able to remember many details extremely vividly (see [17] of the Judgment). The Judge found that the vivid details the Accused narrated in his Long Statement were products of conscious recollection and not \u201creconstruction\u201d as the Accused later claimed in cross-examination. For this reason the Judge accepted the Prosecution\u2019s submission that the Accused did not \u201close his mind\u201d. He went on to say at [18] of the Judgment:",
      "23": "The Judge further noted that in relation to the defence of diminished responsibility, the Accused\u2019s acts of stabbing both Zhang and Feng, constituted a single transaction because the two incidents followed each other so closely in time that it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that his state of mind and degree of self-control would have changed significantly in the interval of time between stabbing Zhang and soon thereafter stabbing Feng (at [19] of the Judgment).",
      "24": "While the Accused did not deny that he had stabbed Zhang and Feng, he maintained that he had nothing to do with the death of Yang, even as he acknowledged that he had also stabbed Li. Unlike his attacks on Zhang and Feng, which were not witnessed by anyone, Li was able to give evidence in court as to how the Accused came into Bedroom 2 and attacked her and Yang. Her account is largely consistent with what the Accused told the police in his statements, with a few significant exceptions.",
      "25": "The Accused\u2019s version of events as recounted in his Long Statement of 29 September 2008 was this. Having stabbed Feng, he noticed the door to Bedroom 2 was \u201csuddenly\u201d opened and he saw two persons standing at the doorway. Still holding a knife he rushed into Bedroom 2. Although the room was dark such that he was unable to see the faces of these two persons he knew they were Yang and Li. They retreated into the room away from the door but he followed and stabbed one of them. He said that he had lost his mind and could not control his emotions. While he was stabbing that person the other ran out of Bedroom 2. He did not give chase but continued to stab the first person. Only when the person he was stabbing had collapsed onto the bed and was motionless did he leave Bedroom 2 to search for the person who had earlier run out of Bedroom 2.",
      "26": "He searched the whole flat \u2013 first Bedroom 3, then the kitchen, then the toilet in the kitchen and finally Bedroom 1; he noted also that the sliding glass door leading to the balcony was closed and thought that the person who had fled from Bedroom 2 could not have left the Flat. In his words he became \u201cpanicky\u201d when he could not locate her. He then returned to Bedroom 2 and was \u201cshocked\u201d to find that the person he had left motionless on the bed was no longer there. He went out of the bedroom to look for her. He saw that the door to the kitchen toilet was closed and kicked it open, and found her in there. He began stabbing at her with the same knife. In the midst of the struggle she managed to take away his knife, which made him \u201cfrighten\u201d [sic]; thereupon he proceeded to take another knife from the cutlery shelf and renewed his attack on her. At some point he dropped the second knife and grabbed a third knife from the cutlery shelf and continued stabbing her. He ceased when he saw her lying on the floor motionless.",
      "27": "According to him, he then emerged from the toilet. He observed that the flats in the opposite block had their lights switched on and the residents of those flats were looking in the direction of the ground. He followed their gaze and saw a body on the ground. He deduced that this must be the person who had run out from Bedroom 2 and whom he was not able to locate despite searching the entire flat. There was no dispute that the person whose body was lying on the ground was Yang and that the other person whom he had stabbed in Bedroom 2 as well as in the toilet was Li although the Accused in his Long Statement did not identify them by name.",
      "28": "The Prosecution disputed the assertion in the Accused\u2019s Long Statement that as he was stabbing Feng, the door of Bedroom 2 opened \u201csuddenly\u201d with Yang and Li appearing at the doorway, which led him to rush spontaneously and immediately towards Bedroom 2 to attack Yang and Li with the same serrated knife that he had used to stab Zhang and Feng earlier. The Prosecution\u2019s case theory was that after stabbing Feng, the Accused entered the kitchen to search for another weapon. There, the Accused picked up a metal spatula, but subsequently, upon realising that the spatula was not a sufficiently sharp object to kill a person with, deposited it into the washing machine. The Accused then picked up a chopper from the kitchen and entered Bedroom 2 to attack Yang and Li.",
      "29": "The Prosecution relied on Li\u2019s evidence as well as expert evidence to formulate the above case theory. Li testified that both she and her mother Yang were sleeping in Bedroom 2 when she was awakened by the sound of heavy breathing outside. Then, the door to her bedroom swung open and the Accused rushed in to attack her, slashing her multiple times. The Accused was then completely naked. Thereafter, the Accused left Bedroom 2. Li was not aware at the time that her mother, Yang, had already run out of Bedroom 2 and that the Accused left in order to pursue her. When the Accused was leaving the bedroom, Li heard him telling her in Mandarin, \u201cYou do not move, you do not move.\u201d",
      "30": "The Judge found that Li\u2019s evidence was supported by the evidence of the Prosecution\u2019s forensic expert, Ms Lim Chin Chin, who prepared a crime scene reconstruction report (\u201cthe Reconstruction Report\u201d) based on 13 expert reports (see the Judgment at [33]). Blood smudges containing a mixture of the DNA profiles of the Accused, Zhang and Feng were found on the exterior door knob of Bedroom 2, making it very likely that it was the Accused who had opened the door to Bedroom 2 to attack Yang and Li. Moreover, it was clear that the serrated knife used to kill Zhang and Feng was not the weapon used to attack Yang and Li. This was because Li\u2019s DNA was not found on the serrated knife \u2013 whereas the DNA of Zhang, Feng and the Accused were found on it \u2013 and also since the serrated knife was eventually recovered by the police from a location under the bed spreads on the floor in Bedroom 1.",
      "31": "Based on the expert evidence, the Judge found that after attacking Zhang and Feng, the Accused hid the serrated knife underneath the bedding on the floor in Bedroom 1 where it was recovered by the police (see the Judgment at [34]). The Accused then went to obtain another weapon before setting out to attack the tenants in Bedroom 2. The Judge also accepted the findings in the Reconstruction Report which stated that before going to Bedroom 2 the Accused had also gone to Bedroom 3, switched on the light and opened the wardrobe there for some unknown reason. The Accused had also gone into the kitchen, made contact with the metal turner in the red basket beside the kitchen sink and placed the spatula in the washing machine. Accordingly, the Judge opined that a considerable interval of time had elapsed between the Accused\u2019s attacks on Zhang and Feng and his subsequent attacks on Yang and Li, who were keeping to themselves inside Bedroom 2 with the door closed. The Judge opined (at [37] of the Judgment) that \u201cthere was a distinct and marked temporal break\u201d between the attacks on Zhang and Feng and the attacks on Yang and Li and that \u201cwhatever defence that applies to the first two murders does not necessarily apply to the murder of Yang as well\u201d.",
      "32": "In contrast with the level of detail with which he described his attack of the other three victims, the Accused consistently denied any knowledge as to how Yang fell to her death. The Prosecution\u2019s case was that as the Accused was attacking Li in Bedroom 2 with the chopper, Yang ran out of the bedroom into the kitchen. Yang then climbed out of the kitchen window to stand on the narrow concrete overhang, holding on to the laundry pole holders below the window sill. In the meantime, the Accused, who was then attacking Li, and presumably being concerned that Yang could run out of the Flat to raise an alarm, changed tack and came out of Bedroom 2 to pursue Yang. Upon finding Yang on the overhang, the Accused used the chopper to cut Yang\u2019s fingers, causing Yang to lose her grip on the laundry pole holders and fall from a height of six storeys to her death.",
      "33": "The Judge agreed with the Prosecution and held that the Accused had caused Yang\u2019s death. While there was no direct witness evidence, the Judge, in coming to this finding, relied on a number of pieces of objective evidence as well as the Reconstruction Report. To begin with, there was Dr Wee\u2019s opinion that the wounds on Yang\u2019s fingers were not caused by the fall or by the metallic window frame ledge. Dr Wee testified that the incised wounds on the anterior aspect of Yang\u2019s right hand fingers appeared to be defensive injuries, which could have been inflicted when Yang gripped a sharp instrument with her hand while it was being removed by her assailant. Dr Wee concluded, after having regard to the Reconstruction Report, that the assailant had cut the back of Yang\u2019s fingers on her left hand while Yang was holding on to the two bamboo pole holders outside the Flat (at [41] of the Judgment).",
      "34": "The Judge also accepted the postulations suggested in the Reconstruction Report that there was no evidence to indicate that Yang\u2019s fingers were cut while she was in the Flat. He noted that if her fingers had been cut while she was still inside the Flat, one would have expected to find some of her DNA in the large number of blood swabs taken from within the Flat. In particular, one would have expected her DNA to have been found on the inner kitchen wall, the kitchen window frame, the kitchen window sill area and/or the kitchen sink area, because in the process of climbing out of the kitchen window, her bloodied fingers would have made contact with some of these areas. She could not have climbed out of the kitchen windows without her hands being in contact with some of those areas and thereby leaving some traces of blood and DNA (see the Judgment at [42]\u2013[43]).",
      "35": "Yet the blood swabs taken at the interior surface of the window and sink areas in the kitchen contained a mixture of the Accused\u2019s, Feng\u2019s and Li\u2019s DNA profiles but not Yang\u2019s, which was consistent with the Prosecution\u2019s case that the Accused was at the kitchen window slashing Yang\u2019s fingers while Yang was standing on the overhang and holding on to the pole holders for dear life. Equally pertinent was the fact that Yang\u2019s DNA profile was found in contact bloodstains and spatter stains on the two pole holders and the exterior wall surface of the kitchen. The Judge therefore found that the Accused had slashed at the fingers of Yang while she was holding on to the pole holders, causing her to fall to her death (see the Judgment at [45]).",
      "36": "It was not disputed that there were two separate attacks on Li. The first occurred immediately after the Accused entered Bedroom 2, and the second took place after the Accused re-entered Bedroom 2 following his having caused Yang to fall to her death from the concrete overhang outside the kitchen window. Li\u2019s evidence was that after the first attack, and after the Accused had left Bedroom 2 in search of Yang, she walked towards the door of Bedroom 2 and closed it. As she did so, the Accused returned to Bedroom 2 with a knife in his hand and pushed her to the lower deck of the double-decker bed. The Accused instructed her in Mandarin to \u201cclose [her] eyes and not to scream\u201d and promised that he would not kill her. Li agreed but did not close her eyes fully as she did not trust the Accused. She managed to see the Accused thrust the knife towards her whereupon she screamed and kicked him. He fell; and, taking the opportunity (while bleeding profusely), she then ran out of Bedroom 2 and across the living room into the kitchen toilet, where she locked herself in by securing the foldable door.",
      "37": "The Accused pursued her and succeeded in pulling the foldable door apart. He used a knife to slash Li repeatedly at her face and neck. She screamed until she was no longer able to and lay still on the floor of the toilet. At that point she heard the Accused say, in Mandarin, words to the effect of \u201cI do not chop you anymore\u201d and walked out of the toilet. Li understood this to mean that the Accused thought that she was as good as dead. At that moment, she said to herself, in Mandarin, \u201cGod, let me go\u201d. The Accused might have heard her; he returned to the toilet and stabbed Li several more times with the aim of finishing her off (see the Judgment at [48]). The Judge found that the Accused\u2019s intention that night was to silence everyone present in the Flat including Yang and Li because they had recognised him.",
      "38": "After the Accused had stabbed Li in the kitchen toilet, he went to the attached bathroom in Bedroom 3 where he placed the knife and the chopper used in the attack on Li \u2013 and probably in the attack on Yang \u2013 on the bathroom floor and proceeded to take a shower. Thereafter, he put on his clothes, put plasters on his injured finger, packed his bag with clothes, money and travel documents \u2013 including his passport and Chinese identity card \u2013 and put on his socks and shoes. The Accused denied that he was trying to escape from the scene. He said that he had felt \u201clost\u201d and was confused as to how the packed bags ended up in the living room, where they were eventually found. Nevertheless, the Judge found (at [52] of the Judgment) that the Accused had had the presence of mind to make preparations to leave the Flat and flee the country. However, before he could escape, the police arrived.",
      "39": "The Accused did not resist arrest. He informed a police officer that he had killed three of the occupants in the Flat \u2013 the fourth having jumped out of the window after he had injured her in the kitchen with a knife \u2013 and that he had attacked the women because they had all verbally and physically abused him. The following extract is from a statement given by Senior Investigating Officer, Desmond Tan Hsien Yang (\u201cSIO Desmond Tan\u201d), who interviewed the Accused at the scene:",
      "40": "As we have mentioned above, the Judge held that in relation to Yang\u2019s death the Accused had committed the actus reus of murder. He also held that the Accused had possessed the requisite mens rea for murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code, ie, the intention to kill Yang. In considering the Accused\u2019s state of mind when he slashed Yang\u2019s fingers as she was holding on to the pole holders, the Judge noted that the behaviour and actions of an accused person before, during and immediately after the criminal acts are highly probative (at [46] of the Judgment). Upon evaluation of the evidence, the Judge found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused was fully aware of and understood what he was doing when he slashed Yang\u2019s fingers and that he had concealed this knowledge in his statements to the police and in his oral evidence of how he had deliberately caused Yang to fall to her death in order to silence her (at [53] of the Judgment).",
      "41": "The Judge therefore found (at [54] of the Judgment) that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the offence under s 300(a) of the Penal Code for all three of the murder charges. He then went on to consider the defence of diminished responsibility raised in relation to each of the murder charges and held that the defence succeeded in two out of the three murder charges.",
      "42": "In relation to the 1st Charge, ie, Zhang\u2019s murder, the Judge agreed with the expert psychiatrist for the Defence that the Accused was in a state of frenzy when he attacked Zhang. As such he held that the Accused had succeeded in proving that the defence of diminished responsibility applied to the killing of Zhang (see the Judgment at [81]). In relation to the 2nd Charge, ie, Feng\u2019s murder, the Judge found that Feng had entered Bedroom 1 while the Accused was still stabbing Zhang in a frenzied state. In that state the Accused was unable to recognise Feng but wanted to kill \u201cthe person standing at the doorway\u201d as well. In the light of his earlier finding that the stabbings of Zhang and Feng should be viewed as a single transaction, the Judge found that the Accused had succeeded in proving that the defence of diminished responsibility applied to his killing of Feng as well (see the Judgment at [82]\u2013[83]).",
      "43": "However, in relation to the 4th Charge, ie, Yang\u2019s killing, the Judge found (at [84] of the Judgment) that there had been a sufficient interval of time between the attacks on Zhang and Feng, and the attacks on Yang and Li, for the Accused to have substantially recovered his mental faculties and self-control. The Judge accorded much weight to the evidence of Li because she was the sole survivor and thus the only one who gave direct evidence. He accepted Li\u2019s evidence that the Accused was able to issue coherent instructions for her \u201cnot [to] move\u201d and to \u201cclose her eyes and not to scream\u201d; and to lie to her by promising that he would not kill her to induce her not to struggle. In his view, the Accused\u2019s actions after his attacks on Zhang and Feng were deliberate, directed and methodical. The Judge did not consider that, at the time the Accused slashed Yang\u2019s fingers with the intention of causing her to fall to her death, his mental responsibility for his actions was substantially impaired. He therefore found that the Accused had not succeeded in proving that the defence of diminished responsibility applied to his killing of Yang (see the Judgment at [85]\u2013[90]).",
      "44": "In CCA 12/2012, the Prosecution appealed against the acquittals of the Accused of the charges of murder in relation to Zhang and Feng, which it submits are against the weight of the evidence for the following reasons:\n(a)     The Judge erred in finding that the Accused had proven on a balance of probabilities that his mental responsibility had been substantially impaired as a result of his adjustment disorder notwithstanding, inter alia:\n(i)       The fact that the Accused was able to provide a coherent and detailed account of the circumstances and events leading to and during his attacks on Zhang and Feng; and\n(ii)       The evidence that the Accused had been thinking coherently throughout the course of the attacks on both Zhang and Feng as well as the evidence as to his ability to experience emotions that were in line with the unfolding events.\n(b)     The Judge further erred:\n(i)       By erroneously concluding that the Accused was in \u201ca frenzy which was beyond his control\u201d when he attacked Zhang and had continued to be in a \u201cfrenzied state\u201d when he subsequently attacked Feng;\n(ii)       By erroneously concluding on the basis of the number of stab wounds on Zhang and Feng that the Accused could avail himself of the diminished responsibility partial defence;\n(iii)       By failing to give sufficient weight to the psychiatric evidence suggesting that any violence linked to an adjustment disorder would be \u201cmild\u201d, \u201creactive\u201d and \u201cimpulsive\u201d in nature, and would be an almost immediate response to the incident or stressor;\n(iv)       By erroneously finding that the defence of diminished responsibility applied in relation to the Accused\u2019s attack on Feng when adjustment disorder manifests itself as a response against the stressor only and not against third parties;\n(v)       By failing to give sufficient weight to the evidence that a substantial period of time of about an hour had elapsed between the Accused\u2019s initial argument with Zhang and his subsequent attack on her; and\n(vi)       By placing undue weight on the Accused\u2019s claim that he was \u201cbrooding\u201d and \u201cseeing red\u201d before his attack on Zhang.\n(c)     The Judge further erred by preferring the psychiatric evidence of the Defence expert to that of the Prosecution\u2019s expert notwithstanding, inter alia:\n(i)       The belated psychiatric assessment by the Defence expert which took place nearly two years after the killings;\n(ii)       The Defence expert\u2019s refusal to take into account other sources of evidence in making his assessment of the Accused\u2019s mental state, including:\n(A)       His refusal to obtain any of the Accused\u2019s detailed police statements which were admitted without challenge; and\n(B)       His refusal to consider Li\u2019s account of events in her statements to the police.\n(iii)       The lack of explanation by the Defence expert as to how the Accused would have lost his self-control as a result of the adjustment disorder;\n(iv)       The failure of the Defence expert to consider accounts that were at odds with those he had recorded from the Accused;\n(v)       The integrity and comprehensiveness of the Prosecution\u2019s expert evidence which involved an assessment of the Accused which was close in time to the incident and which was made only after the expert had spoken to a variety of individuals who knew the Accused and would be able to provide insights into the Accused\u2019s behaviour; and\n(vi)       The consonance of the Prosecution\u2019s expert\u2019s conclusions with the objective evidence.\n(d)     The Judge further erred by failing to give weight to the Accused\u2019s continued vacillation, evasiveness and lack of candour in the course of his testimony.",
      "45": "In CCA 4/2013, the Accused appealed against the conviction and sentence on the charge of murder in relation to Yang on grounds that:\n(a)     The Judge wrongly concluded that the Accused had caused Yang\u2019s death, having erred in relying on the Reconstruction Report in finding that the Accused had cut the fingers of Yang whilst she was holding onto the bamboo pole holders and standing on the concrete overhang outside the kitchen window of the Flat \u2013 it would be unsafe to rely solely on the Reconstruction Report to support a conviction for murder in the absence of corroborative evidence;\n(b)     The Judge erred in finding that there was a sufficient time interval for the Accused to substantially recover his self-control from the time he stopped stabbing Zhang and Feng to the time he commenced his attack on Yang in that:\n(i)       The sequence of events could have taken place in a mere matter of minutes and in a continuous manner;\n(ii)       The said sequence of events were mechanical and instinctive rather than reflective of the fact that the Accused had regained control of himself;\n(c)     The Judge failed to consider that the Accused\u2019s adjustment disorder was the result of a prolonged depressive mood coupled with feelings of helplessness caused by multiple stressors and was a continuing mental illness incapable of \u201cswitching on and off\u201d, and failed to consider that it was not possible to have the said illness compartmentalised as to the extent of severity in the short period of at most a few minutes;\n(d)     The Judge erred in concluding that the physical exertion of stabbing Zhang and Feng in total ninety-odd times would have had a cathartic effect on the Accused, and thereby failed adequately to consider that the Accused\u2019s psychiatric illness was the result of prolonged multiple stressors since 2007 and that his actions that night were an expression of his illness being triggered and not simply an emotional release of the frustration and pent-up anger in him alone;\n(e)     The Judge erred in finding that the subsequent attacks on Yang and Li by the Accused were done in cold blood in order to silence them and not in the heat of a frenzied attack, and that his acts were clearly deliberate, purposeful, directed and methodical. In particular, the Judge erred in failing to appreciate that the attack on Yang was part of a single continuous transaction starting from the attacks on Zhang and Feng, and the Judge having found that the attacks on Zhang and Feng were due to the Accused\u2019s inability to assert control in his frenzied state, should also have found that the attack on Yang was caused by a similar inability to control himself.",
      "46": "Thus the issues which arise for our determination in the present appeals are:\n(a)     Whether the elements for murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to the 4th Charge (ie, Yang\u2019s murder); and\n(b)     Whether the defence of diminished responsibility was successfully raised in relation to the 1st, 2nd and/or the 4th Charge(s).",
      "47": "The Defence contended that the Judge erred in relying on the Reconstruction Report in finding (at [45] of the Judgment) that \u201cit was none other than [the Accused] who had cut the fingers of Yang whilst she was holding onto the bamboo pole holders and standing on the concrete overhang outside the kitchen window of the Flat\u201d. In particular, the Defence contended that it would be \u201cunsafe to rely solely on the [Reconstruction Report] to support a conviction for murder in the absence of any other corroborative evidence\u201d. This contention is clearly flawed. This is certainly not a case of a conviction based on a single witness\u2019s uncorroborated evidence. The Accused was found guilty on the basis of a mound of circumstantial evidence, which the Reconstruction Report merely amalgamated: it was based on the information and findings from 13 different expert reports on the objective physical evidence found at the scene.",
      "48": "In our judgment, the Judge was correct in accepting the finding in the Reconstruction Report that there was no evidence to suggest that Yang\u2019s fingers were slashed while she was in the Flat. Our reasons are in essence the same as those of the Judge\u2019s at [41]\u2013[45] of the Judgment, which reasons we summarised at [29]\u2013[31] earlier. We might add that the absence of Yang\u2019s DNA inside the kitchen at or near the window is striking because, having seen the photographs of the kitchen, we do not think it possible that Yang could have vaulted out of the window without the aid of her hands. Indeed, it is only natural for anyone climbing out of such a window to hold on to things or objects around it.",
      "49": "It follows that Yang\u2019s fingers must have been slashed by the Accused as she stood on the concrete overhang outside the kitchen window desperately holding on to the pole holders. There is simply no other plausible explanation for how she came to sustain the injuries on her hands. The Defence sought to make something of the fact that Yang\u2019s blood was not found on the chopper, which the Prosecution alleged was the weapon used to cut Yang\u2019s hands, but we do not think that this point can take the Defence very far. In the first place, we accept that, as the Prosecution\u2019s forensic expert Ms Lim Chin Chin explained, Yang\u2019s blood was likely to have been washed from the chopper by Li\u2019s blood when the Accused subsequently renewed his attack on Li, at least to the extent that it was no longer detectable in forensic tests. In any event, we think it immaterial whether it was the chopper or another knife which was used to slash Yang\u2019s hands \u2013 what cannot be disputed is that her hands were slashed by someone and that this was done with a knife. In the circumstances there can be no reasonable doubt that that someone was the Accused, and it does not matter which particular weapon he used.",
      "50": "Next, in order for the 4th Charge to be made out, it must be shown that the Accused caused Yang\u2019s death. We recognise that there is no direct evidence as to the point in time at which Yang fell to her death from the concrete overhang outside the kitchen. What was clear was that after the Accused stopped attacking Li at Bedroom 2, he went in search of Yang who had earlier run out of the bedroom. Bearing in mind what he did later to Li (as described in [32]\u2013[33] above), there can be no doubt that he intended to ensure that there would be no witness as to what happened that night at the Flat. We agree with the Judge that his intention was to finish off Yang when he found her standing on the overhang holding onto the pole holders. The inference is irresistible that when the Accused slashed Yang\u2019s fingers with which she was holding onto the pole holders, he intended to cause Yang to fall six floors to her death. There can be no other sensible way of looking at the scenario. We thus have no doubt that it was the Accused\u2019s attack that caused Yang to lose her grip and footing and fall to her death. We are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused caused Yang\u2019s death and so committed the actus reus of murder as alleged in the 4th Charge.",
      "51": "As to the mens rea, this was not a point on which the Defence had advanced much argument since their case was that the Accused had not even caused Yang\u2019s death. But given our finding that the Accused did in fact slash Yang\u2019s fingers as she stood precariously outside the kitchen window, the inexorable inference is that he did so intending that she should release her grip on the pole holders and fall to the ground below. In our opinion this is clearly indicative of an intention to kill. They were six storeys up; it is impossible to believe that the Accused intended no more than, say, to injure her. For this reason we find that the Accused possessed the mens rea for murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code.",
      "52": "We would add that, in our view, the Accused\u2019s consistent denial of involvement in Yang\u2019s death represents a self-serving attempt to reduce his culpability. It is notable that in the very first statement given by the Accused, an oral statement made at the scene at about 1.20am on 19 September 2008 to SIO Desmond Tan (which was subsequently reduced to a report in the latter\u2019s field diary), the Accused stated that all the female inhabitants in the Flat had abused him both physically and verbally (see above at [35]), even though this was, on his later testimony, not the case at all. This was presumably before he knew that Li had survived the attack and might be able to contradict his testimony. The Accused obviously had no compunctions about lying to save himself by presenting himself as having been abused by all the inhabitants of the flat; this demonstrated a strong instinct for self-preservation even so soon after the material events. He was observed by the police officers to appear calm and he answered their questions coherently. He had showered and then prepared himself, before the police arrived, to flee the scene fully dressed with bags packed with money and travel documents. In this lucid state of mind, it is clear to us \u2013 as it was to the Judge \u2013 that the Accused was entirely capable of concealing his part in Yang\u2019s death by claiming that she had leapt out of the kitchen window.",
      "53": "We therefore find that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt the elements for murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code in respect of Yang\u2019s death. The remaining question is whether the Accused can avail himself of the partial defence of diminished responsibility for this as well as the other two murder charges and it is to this issue that we now turn.",
      "54": "As we have noted, the Accused has relied, in respect of all three murder charges, on the partial defence of diminished responsibility as set out in Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code (even though his primary position in relation to the death of Yang was that she, on her own, had jumped out of the window). The provision reads:",
      "55": "It will be seen that there are three elements to the defence, viz, (a) an abnormality of mind (b) arising from one of the prescribed causes \u2013 mental impairment or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury \u2013 and (c) which has substantially impaired the offender\u2019s mental responsibility.",
      "56": "The defence of diminished responsibility is excusatory as opposed to justificatory in nature. In other words, the law regards the offender\u2019s killing as wrongful but is prepared to exercise compassion because the offender was suffering from a mental abnormality at the time which substantially, albeit not fully, impaired his moral responsibility for the wrongful acts. As stated by Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan and Chan Wing Cheong, the authors of Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore (LexisNexis, 2nd ed, 2012) at para 27.6, \u201cbecause the offender is found to be \u2018half mad and half bad\u2019, the law appropriately reduces the offence from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder\u201d.",
      "57": "We begin the consideration of the partial defence by examining the psychiatric evidence that was adduced at the trial below. The Defence and the Prosecution each called a medical expert: Dr Tommy Tan Kay Seng (\u201cDr Tan\u201d) testified for the Defence while Dr Kenneth Gerard Koh Wun Wu (\u201cDr Koh\u201d) testified for the Prosecution. The experts agreed that the Accused was then suffering from a type of adjustment disorder. There are several types or subtypes of adjustment disorder but they are classified under a single umbrella term because of what they have in common.",
      "58": "As explained in the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\u201cDSM-IV\u201d), the \u201cessential feature\u201d of adjustment disorders is \u201ca psychological response to an identifiable stressor or stressors that results in the development of clinically significant emotional or behavioural symptoms\u201d. These symptoms are to be considered \u201cclinically significant\u201d if they are in excess of the reaction that would ordinarily be expected given the nature of the stressor or if they cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. Or, as it is put in the World Health Organisation\u2019s ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines (\u201cICD-10\u201d), adjustment disorders refer to states of \u201csubjective distress and emotional disturbance\u201d arising in the period of \u201cadaptation to a significant life change or to the consequences of a stressful life event\u201d. These are the canonical definitions, but in layman\u2019s terms, if we might venture to use our own words, the gist of adjustment disorder is a state of psychological disturbance in response to a source of stress.",
      "59": "The experts also agreed that the source of stress giving rise to the Accused\u2019s adjustment disorder was his relationship with Zhang. Dr Tan pointed in particular to the following aspects of that relationship which would have given rise to stress on the Accused\u2019s part: (i) harassment of the Accused by Zhang\u2019s family, including death threats; (ii) the Accused\u2019s loss of his job; (iii) the loss of his retirement fund; and (iv) the humiliating and degrading conditions in which Zhang made him live when he was in Singapore.",
      "60": "As we have mentioned, there are several subtypes of adjustment disorders, each of which manifests its own predominant symptoms. That is to say, which subtype a patient is considered to be suffering from depends on the nature of the symptoms observed in that patient. The DSM-IV names six different subtypes; by way of example we shall describe three of them:\n(a)     With depressed mood: this subtype is used when the predominant manifestations are symptoms such as depressed mood, tearfulness and feelings of hopelessness.\n(b)     With anxiety: this subtype is used when the predominant manifestations are symptoms such as nervousness, worry or jitteriness.\n(c)     With disturbance of conduct: this subtype is used when the predominant manifestation is a disturbance in conduct in which there is a violation of the rights of others or of societal norms and rules, eg, vandalism, reckless driving or fighting.",
      "61": "As for the ICD-10, it names seven subtypes, or more precisely, it demarcates seven different clinical forms that adjustment disorder can take. This is not very much different from the six subtypes envisaged in the DSM-IV even though the terminology may differ. For instance, one of the clinical forms described in the ICD-10 is \u201cprolonged depressive reaction\u201d which refers to a \u201cmild depressive state occurring in response to a prolonged exposure to a stressful situation but of duration not exceeding 2 years\u201d; this is similar to the \u201cwith depressed mood\u201d subtype in the DSM-IV. To take another example, the ICD-10 describes a clinical form of adjustment disorder that is \u201cwith predominant disturbance of conduct\u201d in that the patient manifests a disturbance involving conduct, eg, \u201can adolescent grief reaction resulting in aggressive or dissocial behaviour\u201d; this is similar to the \u201cwith disturbance of conduct\u201d subtype in the DSM-IV.",
      "62": "Of significance to this case is that the ICD-10 has this to say of adjustment disorder in general \u2013 that is, not in relation to any particular clinical form or subtype that the disorder can take \u2013 \u201cThe individual may feel liable to dramatic behaviour or outbursts of violence, but these rarely occur\u201d. Indeed, it would appear from both the DSM-IV and the ICD-10 that for certain clinical forms or subtypes of adjustment disorder, violence is not a predominant symptom. Instead, the predominant symptoms in those subtypes include such things as feelings of depression or nervousness.",
      "63": "Both experts were in agreement as to the specific clinical form or subtype of adjustment disorder that the Accused was labouring under. In the language of the ICD-10, which Dr Tan used, it is called \u201cprolonged depressive order\u201d and it has been described above as a \u201cmild depressive state occurring in response to a prolonged exposure to a stressful situation but of duration not exceeding 2 years\u201d. In the language of the DSM-IV, which Dr Koh referred to, it is called \u201cadjustment disorder with depressed mood\u201d and, as has also been described above, this is when the \u201cpredominant manifestations are symptoms such as depressed mood, tearfulness, or feelings of hopelessness\u201d. Thus the central characteristic of the specific type or subtype of adjustment disorder which the Accused had is that it manifests in feelings of depression.",
      "64": "Thus Dr Koh, testifying for the Prosecution, was ready to concede that the Accused suffered from a recognised psychiatric condition. He emphasised, however, that the symptoms of depressed mood described by the Accused \u201cdid not appear to approach the severity of a major depressive episode\u201d. Dr Tan, for the Defence, explained that the difference between the Accused\u2019s adjustment disorder and major depressive disorder is that the former manifests fewer symptoms than the latter. He was also quick to emphasise that the use of the word \u201cmild\u201d should not mislead one into thinking that the Accused\u2019s adjustment disorder was not serious \u2013 it was, and all the more because it had been going on for years. This was what Dr Tan said:",
      "65": "More importantly, Dr Tan said that patients with adjustment disorders \u201care more liable to outbursts of violence\u201d, notwithstanding the suggestion in the ICD-10 that violence rarely occurs in patients with these disorders. He based this opinion on a study of the statistical relationship between certain personal attributes and the risk of violence known as the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study (\u201cthe MacArthur Study\u201d). In this project, researchers studied a sample group of 1,136 individuals and statistically identified factors that were related to increases in the risk of violence. What is material for the purposes of this case is that the MacArthur Study concluded that \u201ca diagnosis of a major mental disorder\u2014especially a diagnosis of schizophrenia\u2014was associated with a lower rate of violence than a diagnosis of a personality or adjustment disorder. A co-occurring diagnosis of substance abuse was strongly predictive of violence\u201d [emphasis in original].",
      "66": "Relying on a subsequent work that summarised and integrated the principal findings of the MacArthur Study, John Monahan et al, Rethinking Risk Assessment: The MacArthur Study of Mental Disorder and Violence (Oxford University Press, 2001), Dr Tan explained that the MacArthur Study separated participants suffering from \u201cmajor\u201d mental disorders from those suffering from \u201cother\u201d mental disorders. Participants suffering from adjustment disorder fell within the latter group of \u201cother\u201d mental disorders. The results of the MacArthur Study suggested that the violence rate for participants diagnosed with \u201cother\u201d mental disorders was higher than those diagnosed with \u201cmajor\u201d mental disorders. According to Dr Tan, it followed that patients with adjustment disorder were more prone to violence.",
      "67": "Against this, Dr Koh\u2013 although accepting that adjustment disorder had some association with violence \u2013 testified that such violence was generally of a \u201cmild\u201d, \u201creactive\u201d and \u201cimpulsive\u201d nature. It tended to take place in a \u201cshort burst\u201d. The paradigmatic example given by Dr Koh was that of a national serviceman undergoing basic military training who reacts to a sergeant shouting in his ear by either shouting back or pushing the sergeant. It would be rare, said Dr Koh, for adjustment disorder to result in violence committed against others as opposed to violence inflicted on oneself, and \u201crarer still\u201d for that violence against others to be protracted and severe.",
      "68": "This, in essence, is the psychiatric evidence upon which we have to determine whether, on the facts of this case, the partial defence of diminished responsibility has been established. We now turn to examine the three critical elements of the defence: (a) an abnormality of mind (b) arising from one of the prescribed causes and (c) which substantially impaired the offender\u2019s mental responsibility.",
      "69": "The meaning of the term \u201cabnormality of mind\u201d, which was borrowed directly from the English formulation of the defence, was elaborated on by Lord Parker CJ in the English Court of Appeal in R v Byrne [1960] 2 QB 396 (at 403) in the following manner:",
      "70": "This judicial definition of \u201cabnormality of mind\u201d has been adopted locally on multiple occasions: see for instance the Court of Appeal decisions of Chua Hwa Soon Jimmy v Public Prosecutor [1998] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [21]\u2013[22] and Ong Pang Siew v Public Prosecutor [2011] 1 SLR 606 at [61].",
      "71": "The first sentence of the definition as quoted above suggests that \u201cabnormality of mind\u201d is a wide concept, encompassing any state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that a reasonable man would call it abnormal. In this case the Prosecution aligned itself with the Defence\u2019s position that the Accused had fulfilled elements (a) and (b), viz, an abnormality of mind arising from one of the prescribed causes. The Defence expert Dr Tan opined in his psychiatric report and oral testimony that the Accused was \u201cdepressed in mood\u201d and had an \u201coverwhelming sense of helplessness\u201d. Presumably the Prosecution agrees that this depression and sense of helplessness constituted the \u201cstate of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal\u201d which was considered in R v Byrne to be definitive of the concept of \u201cabnormality of mind\u201d, and that this abnormality of mind arose from an inherent cause in that it was caused by the Accused\u2019s adjustment disorder.",
      "72": "We see no reason to question the Prosecution\u2019s agreement with the Defence on this point. Accordingly the question that remains is whether element (c) is also met, ie, whether the Accused\u2019s abnormality of mind substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his actions.",
      "73": "As the passage from R v Byrne that we have quoted above suggests, there are three usual ways in which a psychiatric condition might substantially impair a person\u2019s mental responsibility. The first is that it affects the person\u2019s \u201cperception of physical acts and matters\u201d. The second is that it hinders the person\u2019s \u201cability to form a rational judgment as to whether an act is right or wrong\u201d. The third is that it undermines the person\u2019s \u201cability to exercise will power to control physical acts in accordance with that rational judgment\u201d. In the present case, only the last of these was seriously urged by the Defence. We make no comment on whether there could be other ways in which a psychiatric condition might substantially impair a person\u2019s mental responsibility since none was suggested by the Defence. The Defence case was and is that the Accused\u2019s adjustment disorder impaired his ability to control his acts and emotions, as opposed to his ability to comprehend his actions.",
      "74": "Having said that, we note that the Accused in his evidence did suggest that his mind was in such a state that he did not know or appreciate what he was doing. He said in cross-examination that his mind had gone \u201cblank\u201d from the time he picked up the serrated knife to attack Zhang until the time he took a shower after the stabbings, and that it was only then or soon after that he realised what he had done:",
      "75": "However, the Judge did not accept the Accused\u2019s assertion that his mind had indeed gone \u201cblank\u201d. He found, instead, that all the vivid details narrated by the Accused in his Long Statements were a product of conscious recollection and not \u201creconstruction\u201d as alleged by the Accused, who claimed at trial that he could not recall the material events. We see no reason to disagree with this finding. The Accused\u2019s ability to recollect the events \u2013 at least when he was giving his various statements, if not during the trial \u2013 indicates to us that he was sufficiently possessed of his faculties to know what he was doing throughout his attacks on Zhang, Feng and Li. Hence we do not think that the Accused\u2019s ability to comprehend the nature or effect of his actions was impaired in any way. The sole point for determination is whether the Accused\u2019s adjustment disorder had at the time impaired his ability to control his actions. In relation to Yang, the Accused did not say anything as to how Yang fell to her death. He only stated that he realised Yang had fallen from the Flat onto the ground after he noticed that occupants of the flats in the opposite block were looking down in the direction of the ground and he followed suit. We will return to this in a moment.",
      "76": "At this juncture it bears highlighting that the Judge drew a distinction between the Accused\u2019s attacks on Zhang and Feng on one hand and his attacks on Yang and Li on the other. He held that the Accused\u2019s mental responsibility had been substantially impaired in relation to the former but not the latter. He reasoned that this was possible because, between his attacks on Zhang and Feng and his attacks on Yang and Li, the Accused had time to perform a \u201clong series of acts\u201d and this would have given him \u201can opportunity to cool down\u201d. In other words there was \u201ctime enough for reason to resume its seat\u201d and for the Accused once again to be the \u201cmaster of his own mind\u201d and thus \u201cmentally responsible for his actions\u201d (at [87]\u2013[88] of the Judgment).",
      "77": "Interestingly, though not unexpectedly, both the Prosecution and the Defence have challenged this part of the Judge\u2019s reasoning. Both sides argued, in effect, that there had not been time enough for the Accused to switch from one state of mind to another; either his mental responsibility had been substantially impaired throughout the killings or it had not been so impaired at all. Thus each side started from a different premise. The Prosecution says that the Judge was correct to have found that the Accused\u2019s mental responsibility had not been substantially impaired when attacking Yang and that in truth there was likewise no such impairment of his mental faculties when he attacked Zhang and Feng. In contrast, the Defence submits that the Judge was right to have found that the Accused\u2019s mental faculties were substantially impaired during his attacks on Zhang and Feng and that it followed that the Judge should also have found substantial mental impairment during the attack on Yang.",
      "78": "Having considered the totality of the circumstances, we are of the view that the better starting point to consider the events of that fateful night is the Accused\u2019s attack on Yang \u2013 or to be more precise, his attack on Li and then Yang which was in turn followed by a renewed attack on Li. The reason we begin here is that we have the benefit of eyewitness evidence from Li as to the Accused\u2019s acts which could shed light on his state of mind when he caused Yang\u2019s death, whereas there is no similar evidence in relation to his attacks on Zhang and Feng.",
      "79": "Indeed, Li\u2019s evidence was the main reason why the Judge found that the Accused\u2019s ability to control himself had not been impaired when he caused Yang\u2019s death. The Judge thought it was significant that he was able to issue coherent instructions to Li \u201cnot [to] move\u201d and to \u201cclose her eyes and not to scream\u201d, and to lie to her by promising that he would not kill her to induce her not to struggle. The Judge opined that the Accused\u2019s expenditure of considerable physical energy in inflicting over 90 knife wounds on Zhang and Feng would have been cathartic such that he would have recovered his self-control. Moreover, based on the evidence of the forensic expert Ms Lim Chin Chin, the Judge found that the Accused had done the following between his killing Zhang and Feng and his killing Yang:\n(a)     Walked into Bedroom 3, switched on the light and opened the wardrobe possibly looking for something in there;\n(b)     Walked to the kitchen, made contact with the metal turner in the red basket beside the kitchen sink and picked up the spatula when it was still dark in the kitchen;\n(c)     Placed the spatula in the washing machine (possibly after realising that the spatula was not a good weapon);\n(d)     Looked for another weapon in the kitchen, and this time picked up a chopper before entering Bedroom 2;\n(e)     Attacked Li at the location towards the rear wall area of Bedroom 2 whereupon Yang seized the opportunity to rush out of the room and into the kitchen;\n(f)     Left Bedroom 2 to look for Yang and warned Li not to move upon realising that Yang had escaped from the room;\n(g)     Spent time looking for Yang whom he eventually found hiding and standing on the concrete overhang outside the kitchen window of the Flat; and\n(h)     Slashed Yang\u2019s fingers with a knife, causing Yang to lose her grip and plunge six storeys to her death.",
      "80": "According to the Judge, the above enumerated acts would cumulatively have allowed the Accused a sufficient opportunity to cool down, that is, if he had not already regained some measure of self-control: these actions of the Accused, after the attacks on Zhang and Feng, did not appear to be the actions of a man still in frenzy and not in control of himself. On the contrary, the Judge considered that his acts were deliberate, directed and methodical. As such, the Judge held that when the Accused slashed Yang\u2019s fingers with the intention of causing her to fall to her death his mental responsibility for his actions was not substantially impaired. The Judge therefore found that the Accused had not succeeded in proving that the partial defence of diminished responsibility applied to his murder of Yang.",
      "81": "In our view, the Judge\u2019s finding that the Accused\u2019s ability to control his actions had not been impaired when he cut Yang\u2019s fingers is not against the weight of the evidence. Admittedly, there are parts of the Judge\u2019s reasoning that may be open to question, such as his opinion that the stabbing of Zhang and Feng must have had a cathartic effect on the Accused. But his central finding as to the Accused\u2019s state of mind when he caused Yang to fall from the concrete overhang outside the kitchen window of the Flat is unassailable. Like the Judge, we also think that the critical evidence was that of the sole survivor of the attacks, Li. We see no basis for interfering with the Judge\u2019s acceptance of her evidence as true.",
      "82": "In assessing the Accused\u2019s mental state it is of particular significance to note that he issued Li with deliberate and clear instructions not to move and even attempted to practice trickery on her by inducing her to close her eyes. What do these acts of the Accused signify? Li\u2019s evidence was drawn to the attention of the Defence expert Dr Tan, and he was asked whether her account of the events made it less likely that the Accused was not in control when he attacked Li. His answers are telling. His initial testimony was that such calculated behaviour on the Accused\u2019s part was nonetheless consistent with loss of self-control, but he subsequently conceded that it was more consistent with the Accused possessing self-control. We place some importance on Dr Tan\u2019s concession and accordingly we reproduce here a lengthy extract of his testimony under cross-examination by the Deputy Public Prosecutor:[note: 2]",
      "83": "In re-examination, Dr Tan did not retract the concession that the Accused\u2019s acts were more consistent with no loss of self-control than with loss of self-control, as this next lengthy extract shows:[note: 3]",
      "84": "It will be noted from these passages that Dr Tan thought that the Accused\u2019s conduct was more consistent with no loss of self-control because of his instruction to Li to close her eyes. That, as the Judge pointed out, was an attempt by the Accused to trick Li, which suggested some measure of sophistication in the Accused\u2019s thought process. We agree with the Judge that this shows that there was no loss of self-control on the Accused\u2019s part at this time. But we note that this attempt to trick Li, instructing Li to close her eyes, only occurred after his attack of Yang. Does it necessarily follow that the Accused\u2019s mind was clear and that he was in control of himself when, he, moments earlier, attacked Yang? While we recognise that theoretically there could be such a possibility, ie, that he was out of control when he attacked Yang but regained control before returning to Bedroom 2 to continue his attack on Li, it is in our view such a highly improbable event as to be beyond reasonable doubt.",
      "85": "In assessing the Accused\u2019s mental state one should not lose sight of the sequence of events that night: after killing Zhang and Feng, the Accused rushed out of Bedroom 1 into Bedroom 2 where Yang and Li were and attacked Li; Yang took the opportunity to run out. After the Accused inflicted a number of wounds on Li, he told her not to move and then left the room in search of Yang. After finding Yang standing on the concrete overhang outside the kitchen window he attacked Yang, causing the latter to fall to her death (see [28]\u2013[29] above). While we are prepared to accept that the Accused\u2019s telling Li not to move, unlike his telling her to close her eyes, did not necessarily lead to an irresistible inference that he had not lost his self-control at the time, we think that his conduct, viewed as a whole, does lead to such an inference. He had the presence of mind to cease attacking Li, ask her not to move and then deal with the potential escape of Yang. Such a course of action indicates rationality, a thinking mind and not someone who has lost his self-control. He was clearly concerned in case Yang should run out of the Flat and raise an alarm. Having found Yang outside the kitchen window, he knew how to deal with her. Accordingly, we do not entertain any doubt that when the Accused cut Yang\u2019s fingers causing her to fall to her death he was very much in control of himself.",
      "86": "At this juncture we wish to say something about the Judge\u2019s finding at [84] of the Judgment that there had been \u201ca substantial interval of time\u201d between the killings of Zhang and Feng and the killing of Yang such that the Accused would have had time to regain control of himself. From the available evidence we could not ascertain with any precision what the length of that interval of time would have been. We cannot say that it was about 30 seconds, or two minutes, or five, or ten. We can only say that after attacking Zhang and Feng the Accused went into the kitchen (for how long is not clear) before barging into Bedroom 2 to attack Yang and Li. In any case, whatever could be the time lapse, as far as the killing of Yang was concerned, the court has the unequivocal evidence of Li to show the state of mind of the Accused.",
      "87": "Accordingly, the partial defence of diminished responsibility must fail in relation to Yang\u2019s death. The Defence has not shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the Accused\u2019s adjustment disorder had substantially impaired his mental responsibility in that it had hampered his ability to control his actions.",
      "88": "We now turn to the Prosecution\u2019s appeal which relates to the deaths of Zhang and Feng. The Judge was of the view that because the deaths of these two women had \u201cfollowed each other so closely in time\u201d, it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that the Accused\u2019s state of mind \u201cchanged significantly\u201d from one to the other. We see no reason to fault this view of the two killings. On the evidence, the Accused\u2019s attack on Feng followed immediately from his attack on Zhang and we think it correct for the Judge to regard this sequence of events as a single transaction where a single state of mind prevailed in the Accused.",
      "89": "The single factor which seemed to be pivotal to the Judge\u2019s determination that the partial defence of diminished responsibility was applicable to the killing of Zhang was the number of injuries which he had inflicted on Zhang and which the Judge described as having been carried out in a frenzy (at [81] of the Judgment):",
      "90": "A careful scrutiny of the grounds of the Prosecution\u2019s appeal suggests that they can be reduced to two main points: first, that the Judge erred in concluding that the Accused had lost control of himself; and second, that he erred in finding or assuming that any loss of control on the Accused\u2019s part was linked to his adjustment disorder as a matter of causation. We shall examine each of these grounds in turn.",
      "91": "As to the question of whether the Accused had lost control, it appears to us that the Judge was heavily influenced by the sheer number of stab wounds that the Accused had inflicted on Zhang and Feng. He also accorded weight to the fact of the Accused\u2019s troubled and peculiar relationship with Zhang. However, we doubt that these two considerations advance the Defence case greatly. Concerning the number of stab wounds, as the Prosecution very pertinently pointed out, a very large number of stab wounds had also been inflicted on Li. Yet, as we have found, the Accused possessed self-control in the attack on Li. What this means is that in the present case we cannot accept that large number of stab wounds per se as indicative of loss of self-control. In principle, it must remain a possibility that an offender, perhaps if pushed to an extreme of fury or for some other reason, would intentionally and with complete self-control stab his victim very many times. For instance, if his intention was to kill the person, either because the person was the source of his stresses or in order to eliminate the person as a witness to his killing, then the greater number of wounds caused would be consistent with achieving that objective. Thus the number of wounds inflicted is but one of the many factors that may or may not, depending on the totality of the factual circumstances, point towards loss of self-control, and cannot be determinative in and of itself.",
      "92": "As regards the nature of the Accused\u2019s relationship with Zhang, while it might provide a plausible trigger for a loss of self-control, in the criminal law there is a world of difference between loss of self-control due to some underlying psychiatric condition, and loss of self-control due to an excess of anger. That is why Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code is triggered only when the abnormality of mind arises from one of the prescribed causes: when it arises from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or is induced by disease or injury. We think that the Judge did not draw that distinction with enough precision and thus did not have sufficient regard to the normal disabilities or traits of a person suffering from adjustment disorder. In the first place, on the Judge\u2019s own reasoning any loss of self-control would seem to have been largely if not exclusively the result of anger. The Accused described \u201cbrooding\u201d and \u201cseeing red\u201d and the Judge found this consistent with the description of a person \u201cwho had anger building up within him\u201d. With respect, that seems to us to acknowledge the normality of the Accused\u2019s reaction \u2013 or perhaps we should say that it suggests an absence of abnormality in his reaction. One could well say that the Accused was reacting as an ordinary person might have in response to repeated and prolonged insult and humiliation.",
      "93": "The causal connection which the Judge found between the Accused\u2019s circumstances and Exception 7 was that the Accused\u2019s adjustment disorder \u201cmight have reduced his capacity to control himself\u201d and led to great anger, which in turn caused him to attack Zhang. With respect, we find that the Judge had probably not given sufficient regard to the nature of adjustment disorder suffered by the Accused as described in the medical literature and by the Prosecution and Defence experts. From the material available to us we find that the essential characteristic of the Accused\u2019s specific type of adjustment disorder is a state of depression and helplessness. That does not seem to fit with the Judge\u2019s reasoning that the Accused\u2019s disorder contributed to the rising anger within him.",
      "94": "Moreover there was the evidence of the Prosecution expert Dr Koh that if adjustment disorder led to violence such violence would generally be \u201cmild\u201d and \u201creactive\u201d or \u201cimpulsive\u201d. These are not the adjectives that could be applied to the Accused\u2019s acts; that they were not \u201cmild\u201d is obvious, and they were not \u201creactive\u201d or \u201cimpulsive\u201d because there was a period of brooding of about an hour separating Zhang\u2019s verbal abuse and the Accused\u2019s attack on her.",
      "95": "As against this relatively benign view of adjustment disorder there is the MacArthur Study, which is the key plank on which the Defence expert rested his opinion that persons with such disorder had a propensity towards serious violence. To recapitulate, the MacArthur Study separated participants suffering from \u201cmajor\u201d mental disorders such as schizophrenia or depression from those suffering from \u201cother\u201d mental disorders including adjustment disorders as well as personality disorders and \u201csuicidality\u201d. As Dr Tan explained, the results of the MacArthur study suggested that the violence rate for participants diagnosed with \u201cother\u201d mental disorders was higher than those diagnosed with \u201cmajor\u201d mental disorders.",
      "96": "We do not think, however, that the MacArthur Study provides much support for Dr Tan\u2019s view that sufferers from adjustment disorder have a propensity for violence. To begin with, the category of \u201cother\u201d mental disorders in that study did not comprise adjustment disorder exclusively but included other personality disorders and conditions. It cannot be said that a higher violence rate among those who suffer from \u201cother\u201d mental disorders means a higher violence rate among those with adjustment disorder. More fundamentally, as the Prosecution points out, the MacArthur Study was based on patients admitted to acute civil inpatient facilities. It is a plausible hypothesis that such patients find themselves in facilities of that sort because their behaviour is particularly out of the ordinary; it may well be that there is a host of individuals suffering from adjustment disorder who did not come under the scrutiny of the MacArthur Study because their behaviour was not extraordinary enough to provide any impetus for their admission into acute civil inpatient facilities. Hence it could be that a very high percentage of all adjustment disorder sufferers are not in the slightest bit susceptible to violent behaviour, and that the MacArthur Study was therefore, in this regard, unreliable due to selection bias. What is clear is that the MacArthur Study is not appropriate, and cannot be relied upon, to establish the characteristics of an adjustment disorder sufferer in relation to his propensity to violence.",
      "97": "For these reasons we find that Dr Tan\u2019s opinion was too widely stated. The MacArthur Study hardly furnishes any basis for an assertion that individuals suffering from adjustment disorder have, as a class, a propensity for violence. It is after all a rather heterogeneous class. Hence Dr Tan\u2019s views do not seem to us to have been built on a solid foundation. In contrast Dr Koh\u2019s evidence was not undermined to any substantial extent and so we prefer his view that adjustment disorder does not generally result in violence as severe as that which transpired in this case.",
      "98": "Therefore, even accepting that the Accused lost his self-control in attacking Zhang and Feng with such violence and viciousness, we are not satisfied that this was due to his adjustment disorder. We think it is more likely that it was nothing more than the culmination of a long period of long-repressed but non-abnormal anger. Thus we hold that it has not been shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the Accused\u2019s mental responsibility was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind in relation to the killings of Zhang. It was anger simpliciter and of an extreme nature as well, but not such as to fall within Exception 7. He wanted to finish her off so that she would never feature in his life again. As for Feng, the Accused\u2019s intention then was to eliminate a person who was a witness to his crime. The same applies to Yang and Li, except that in the case of the latter, she was extremely fortunate to have survived the numerous injuries inflicted by the Accused on her. Accordingly, we hold that the Accused is not protected by the partial defence of diminished responsibility.",
      "99": "For the above reasons we allow the Prosecution\u2019s appeal in CCA12/2012 and dismiss the Accused\u2019s appeal in CCA4/2013. In the result, we find the Accused guilty of the 1st and 2nd charges as set out in [2] above and accordingly convict him of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code in relation to the deaths of Zhang and Feng; and we also affirm his murder conviction \u2013 also under s 300(a) \u2013 in relation to Yang\u2019s death. For each of these three convictions for murder, the Accused shall suffer the punishment of death and we so order."

      "1": "On 20 September 2011, Wang Wenfeng (\u201cWang\u201d) was convicted of murder under s 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). At the time of the conviction, the offence was punishable with a mandatory death penalty under s 302 of the Penal Code. Wang appealed, but the Court of Appeal (\u201cCA\u201d) upheld the conviction and sentence. On 1 January 2013, the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 32 of 2012) came into operation, with the effect that the death sentence is no longer mandatory under ss 300(b), 300(c) and 300(d) of the Penal Code. Consequently, on 16 August 2013, the CA remitted the case back to the High Court for re-sentencing and, on 13 November 2013, I exercised my power under s 4(5)(g) of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2012 to re-sentence Wang to imprisonment for life and to 24 strokes of the cane. The Prosecution has filed an appeal against the sentence and I now give the grounds for my decision.",
      "2": "The full facts of this case are set out in my judgment delivered at the end of the trial in PP v Wang Wenfeng [2011] SGHC 208 (\u201cHC Judgment\u201d), as well as in the grounds of decision of the appeal in Wang Wenfeng v PP [2012] 4 SLR 590; [2012] SGCA 47 (\u201cCA Judgment\u201d). I shall therefore set out only the salient facts below.",
      "3": "Wang is from Fujian Province in the People\u2019s Republic of China. He came to Singapore to work, but at the time of the offence in April 2009, he was out of work and was required to leave Singapore by 15 April 2009. At that time, he could not afford a plane ticket home. He tried to borrow money from his younger sister and his wife but they did not lend him any. On Friday 10 April 2009, Wang decided to resort to robbery to get the money for his airfare.",
      "4": "In the early morning of 11 April 2009, Wang set off to Sun Plaza at Sembawang Drive, carrying with him a haversack containing a fruit knife, a pair of cotton gloves and a small bottle of water. He thought that taxi drivers would be good targets, so he flagged down a taxi. It was driven by the deceased, Yuen Swee Hong (\u201cthe Victim\u201d). Wang directed the Victim to drive to \u201cBao Ping Chun\u201d and, as they neared the destination, he directed the Victim to Jalan Selimang. When the taxi stopped at the end of Jalan Selimang, Wang had already put on his gloves and taken out his knife.",
      "5": "Wang used his left hand to hold the knife against the Victim\u2019s chest and his right hand to hold onto the backrest of the driver\u2019s seat. He told the Victim to hand over his money. A struggle ensued between Wang and the Victim and, in the course of the struggle, Wang stabbed the Victim on his chest. The Court of Appeal (\u201cCA\u201d) found that the Victim was stabbed at least five times (CA Judgment at [36], [38]). The injuries inflicted on the Victim were severe enough to have caused heavy bleeding (HC Judgment at [24]) such that, within two minutes, the struggle ceased and the Victim went limp. This led Wang to believe that the Victim had died. He decided to hide the body in the secondary jungle nearby. After carrying the body to a location well inside the jungle, Wang searched the Victim\u2019s pockets and took the money he found.",
      "6": "Wang subsequently washed himself at a nearby beach and drove the taxi to a multi-storey car park at Canberra Road. He parked the taxi at one of the higher levels. Using the water he brought, he cleaned away the blood from part of the front cabin. He also cut the cables connecting the credit card machine which he thought was a Global Positioning System (\u201cGPS\u201d), took money and the Victim\u2019s mobile phone from the taxi, cleaned the door handle, and left for home.",
      "7": "Sometime later on the same day, Wang went out to dispose of the incriminating items, such as the soiled clothes he had worn. He left the haversack containing these items in a forested area near Nee Soon Road. As he was journeying on a bus, he received a missed call from the Victim\u2019s wife on the Victim\u2019s mobile phone. He alighted and returned a call to the Victim\u2019s wife. He told the Victim\u2019s wife that he was holding the Victim captive and demanded $150,000 from her. Over the course of two days, from 11 April 2009 to 12 April 2009, Wang gave instructions to the Victim\u2019s wife to make payment. When she still did not remit the money to the account number he provided, he reminded her that the Victim had not eaten for two days.",
      "8": "Meanwhile, Wang had secured a place on a flight departing on 14 April 2009. But before he could leave the country, he was arrested by the police on 13 April 2009.",
      "9": "The Indian courts adopt the position that the default punishment for murder is life imprisonment and that the death penalty is an exception (see Bachan Singh v State of Punjab AIR 1980 SC 898 at [151]). This, the Prosecution submitted, was untenable in Singapore for two reasons. First, the legislative framework in India is different. There is no mandatory death penalty for s 300 cases in India, whereas the death penalty is still mandatory for s 300(a) cases in Singapore. Secondly, there is considerable uncertainty in India on the punishment to be ordered in capital offences (see Sangeet v State of Haryana AIR 2013 SC 447 at [81]).",
      "10": "The Prosecution thus submitted that where the law, in this case, s 300(c), provides for a discretionary death penalty, neither life imprisonment nor the death penalty should be viewed as the default position. The correct approach is to consider all the facts and circumstances to determine if the offender ought to suffer the death penalty (see Sia Ah Kew v PP [1974\u20131976] SLR(R) 54 (\u201cSia Ah Kew\u201d) at [8]).",
      "11": "Sia Ah Kew is a case of kidnapping under s 3 of the Kidnapping Act (Cap 101, 1970 Rev Ed). The CA in that case similarly faced the binary choice of death or life imprisonment, and had opined that the maximum sentence of death penalty would be appropriate where the manner of the kidnapping or the acts or conduct of the kidnappers were such as to outrage the feelings of the community (at [5]).",
      "12": "The Prosecution also referred the court to the Parliamentary speech by the Minister for Law when introducing the amendments to the mandatory death penalty regime (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (9 July 2012) vol 89):",
      "13": "Each of the factors was analysed by the Prosecution in light of the facts of this case.",
      "14": "In terms of the seriousness of the offence, the Prosecution submitted on three main aspects. First, the offence was committed in a cruel manner. The Prosecution argued that there was a high degree of premeditation and planning, which was demonstrated by Wang\u2019s intention to commit robbery at the wee hours of the morning, his preparation of items such as a knife, spare change of clothes and a water bottle, his deliberate choice of victim (a taxi driver), and his direction to the Victim to drive to a deserted area (\u201cBao Ping Chun\u201d). The Prosecution further pointed to the way Wang had armed himself with a dangerous weapon, a knife with a 12.5cm blade, and had focused his attack on a vulnerable part of the Victim\u2019s body, viz, the chest. Two of the stab wounds suffered by the Victim were described by the CA as \u201clikely to have been very deep, with [one of them] achieving full, or near-complete, penetration of the knife\u2019s 12.5cm blade\u201d (CA Judgment ([2] supra) at [25]). As a result, the Victim suffered an agonising and painful death. Secondly, Wang\u2019s culpability was high. The Prosecution examined Wang\u2019s post-murder actions and argued he was unremorseful. Particular attention was paid to how Wang robbed from the Victim after he killed him, took steps to conceal the murder, attempted to extort money from the Victim\u2019s family, prepared to flee from Singapore and, even after arrest, led the police on a wild goose chase and gave several false statements. The Prosecution submitted that there were no significant mitigating factors that Wang could rely on. Even though Wang experienced financial stress and loneliness as a foreigner in Singapore, they were not so unusual or extraordinary that he could rely upon them in mitigation. As Yong Pung How CJ stated in Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP [1993] 2 SLR(R) 406 at [10], financial difficulties cannot be relied upon, save, possibly, in the most exceptional or extreme of circumstances. Thirdly, the Prosecution submitted that Wang, being stronger and much younger than the Victim, and having taken the Victim by surprise from behind, had taken an unfair advantage over the Victim. The Prosecution also stressed the high degree of public disquiet that had emanated from the case.",
      "15": "To show how frequent or widespread offences committed against taxi drivers are, the Prosecution produced statistics on the number of robberies, serious hurt and murder committed against taxi drivers between January 2009 and September 2013. Significantly, the number of serious hurt cases over the years are: two in 2009, two in 2010, six in 2011, seven in 2012, and four in the period from January to September 2013. The Prosecution pointed out the particular vulnerability of taxi drivers \u2013 they may be completely at the mercy of their passenger-turned-assailant, and out of the reach of any help that may be rendered by bystanders.",
      "16": "In calling for a deterrent sentence, the Prosecution elaborated on the fact that public transport workers (\u201cPTWs\u201d), especially taxi drivers, have been viewed by the courts as vulnerable victims (see, eg, the CA judgment at [3] and Wong Hoi Len v PP [2009] 1 SLR(R) 115 at [11]). The Prosecution argued that the present case also has a wider-felt impact of triggering unease and offending the sensibilities of the general public, which makes it necessary and appropriate to order a deterrent sentence (see PP v Law Aik Meng [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [25]).",
      "17": "At the time of hearing, there were three other concluded murder re-sentencing cases. In all these cases the court reduced the sentence of death to a sentence of life imprisonment and caning. The Prosecution argued that these cases could be distinguished. In PP v Fabian Adiu Edwin (Criminal Case No 40 of 2009) (\u201cFabian\u201d), the offender was young (18 years old at the time of offence) and had sub-normal intelligence. In PP v Kho Jabing [2014] 1 SLR 973 (\u201cKho Jabing\u201d), the offender was also considered to be young (24 years old at the time of offence) and his choice of weapon was described as opportunistic and improvisational. In PP v Gopinathan Nair Remadevi Bijukumar (Criminal Case No 40 of 2011) (\u201cGopinathan\u201d), the CA did not find that the offender had set out to rob the victim and had given the offender the benefit of doubt that he had been provoked by the victim. The Prosecution submitted that none of these characteristics exist in the present case. Wang was already 30 years old at the time of the offence. From the degree of planning that went into his crime and the calculated steps he took to conceal the evidence, the Prosecution submitted that Wang was a highly intelligent individual. Unlike Kho Jabing, Wang in this case had prepared a knife and therefore, his choice of weapon could not have been opportunistic. Lastly, unlike Gopinathan, Wang set out to rob the Victim and was not provoked.",
      "18": "In light of the foregoing, the Prosecution submitted that the three precedent cases do not bar the court from imposing the death penalty. In fact, as the present case falls squarely within the category of cases that would outrage the feelings of the community, the Prosecution urged the court to re-sentence Wang to death.",
      "19": "The Defence relied on Sia Ah Kew ([10] supra) for the principle that the death penalty should only be imposed for the worst manner of offending. The court was also referred to a number of cases from across the Commonwealth and other jurisdictions, which have a common thread of imposing the death penalty in the most exceptional cases. Therefore, the Defence submitted that the death penalty should only be imposed if the manner by which the murder was carried out was of the most heinous nature, the murderer was of the worst type, and there was an absence of any significant mitigating circumstances. The present case, the Defence argued, was not such a case where death penalty would be appropriate.",
      "20": "Much emphasis was placed on the fact that there was a lack of any premeditation to inflict the fatal injuries. What happened was a sudden and unexpected struggle, during which Wang stabbed the Victim spontaneously. Given that the intention to stab had formed only during the struggle, it could not be said that Wang consciously took advantage of the Victim\u2019s vulnerability or planned to stab the Victim as part of the robbery. Neither was the stabbing inflicted in cold blood as Wang did not relish the act of murder and no further injuries were inflicted on the Victim to ensure that he died.",
      "21": "The Defence stressed that the post-killing acts, such as his extortion of money from the Victim\u2019s family, must be seen in context. They were induced by panic, fear and adrenaline, and the Defence urged the court not to accord them undue weight in the formulation of what his intention was at the beginning of the criminal enterprise and when deciding the appropriate sentence.",
      "22": "To further show that the moral blameworthiness of Wang was below that for the most heinous cases of murder under s 300(c) of the Penal Code, the Defence raised a number of mitigating circumstances. First, Wang did not form the intention to murder the Victim when he set out to commit robbery; he only brought the knife to scare his Victim into submission. Secondly, his mind was not at its clearest when he had formed the intention to stab the Victim during the struggle. At the time of the offence, he was labouring under difficult personal and financial circumstances and when the Victim struggled, he reacted on the spur of the moment without considering the consequences of his actions. Thirdly, the Victim was not made to endure extended pain and suffering; he went limp within two minutes of the struggle. Fourthly, Wang was remorseful for his actions. The Defence admitted that Wang lied to the police initially, but highlighted that Wang volunteered the truth later on. Lastly, Wang was not a hardened criminal, and has the potential to reform and be rehabilitated.",
      "23": "The Defence referred to the four sentencing principles of deterrence, prevention, retribution, and rehabilitation as affirmed by the CA in PP v Kwong Kok Hing [2008] 2 SLR(R) 684, as well as the principle of individualised justice enunciated by V K Rajah J in the High Court decision of Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP [2005] 3 SLR(R) 1. Having regard to the circumstances of Wang\u2019s act, the Defence submitted that all four sentencing objectives can be met by a sentence of life imprisonment, and that life imprisonment was the appropriate sentence to be passed in this case.",
      "24": "There were also three letters written by Wang\u2019s father, sister and daughter pleading for clemency. They mentioned that Wang\u2019s 12-year-old daughter yearned to see her father again, and that his parents were over 50 years old and wished to have the accompaniment of their son in their old age.",
      "25": "In respect of the three precedent cases of re-sentencing, the Defence drew the court\u2019s attention to the fact that none of the cases had meted out the death penalty. On the other hand, in addition to the sentence of life imprisonment, the three precedent cases had imposed either 18 or 24 strokes of cane. Because the Defence submitted that an additional punishment of no more than ten strokes of the cane was appropriate, it had to distinguish the three precedent cases.",
      "26": "In Fabian ([17] supra) and Kho Jabing ([17] supra), the court had imposed the maximum of 24 strokes of cane. The Defence submitted that Wang\u2019s culpability in this case was lower than that of the offenders in Fabian and Kho Jabing because the offenders in the latter two cases had intended to use their weapons to cause bodily injury in furtherance of their robbery. The Defence argued that no such intention was present in this case. In Gopinathan ([17] supra), the court had imposed 18 strokes of cane. The Defence submitted that Wang\u2019s culpability was closer to the facts of Gopinathan because, in both cases, the robberies were motivated by desperate financial circumstances. Nonetheless, the Defence observed that the offender in Gopinathan had maintained his lie about another man who had killed the victim, whereas the offender in this case had shown remorse at an earlier stage and volunteered the truth to the police less than ten days after he gave the false statements.",
      "27": "Given the above, the Defence submitted that the appropriate sentence in this case was life imprisonment and no more than ten strokes of the cane.",
      "28": "The issue before me was whether the facts and circumstances of this case justified imposing the death penalty or life imprisonment with or without caning.",
      "29": "I had found that Wang had not set out with the intention to kill, but with the intention to commit robbery, armed with a knife. He had targeted taxi drivers, presumably for their unique vulnerability. He got the Victim to drive to a lonely spot and pointed the knife at him to get him to surrender his money. However, the Victim tried to snatch or pluck the knife from Wang and a struggle ensued, resulting in the tragic outcome. These would be the relevant facts of the offence, although the aftermath provides some insight into Wang\u2019s frame of mind. When Wang realised that the Victim had gone limp, he got out of the taxi, ascertained that the Victim was dead, and proceeded to hide the body in the nearby jungle. He washed himself in the sea, drove the taxi to a multi-storey carpark, washed off the blood stains and took the Victim\u2019s money and mobile phone. He then attempted to leave the country. When the Victim\u2019s wife called his mobile phone, Wang took advantage of the situation and tried to extort money from her by leading her to think that the Victim was still alive and would be hurt if she did not pay up.",
      "30": "It was in the context of these facts, particularly the facts leading to the killing, and to a lesser extent, the facts post-killing that I have to determine the issue, along with other factors of the case, namely the fact that the Victim was a taxi driver, and part of a vulnerable group.",
      "31": "The Prosecution submitted that this was an offence against a PTW and therefore a deterrent sentence was necessary. There have been cases involving victims who were PTWs in which the courts have held that it was necessary to impose deterrent sentences in view of their vulnerable positions as well as the dangers posed to the public at large. I myself have stated this in a Magistrate\u2019s Appeal: see Balbir Singh s/o Amar Singh v PP [2010] 3 SLR 784. But the expression \u201cpublic transport worker\u201d covers a wide range of people. This ranges from PTWs who operate transportation involving many passengers, such as buses or trains, to those who carry much less, eg, taxis. The degree of danger to the public would vary with the numbers carried. However, the danger may be higher in certain modes of transport, eg, aircraft. The degree of punishment imposed could correspond to the degree of danger posed to the public. There is the special case of taxi drivers, who are vulnerable because they work alone and can be stranded in remote locations. However, it is one thing to impose a higher fine or period of imprisonment for an offence against a taxi driver to deter like-minded from carrying out offences against taxi drivers. It is quite another to say that it is necessary and appropriate to impose a sentence of death where life imprisonment is otherwise called for. For the court to justify imposition of capital punishment on the ground of deterrence, the Prosecution must produce much more evidence to show the inadequacy of life imprisonment (plus caning) as against the death sentence. The only evidence of this produced by the Prosecution was a single incident of murder of a taxi driver in the past five years, which was this present case. There have been a number of cases of serious hurt against taxi drivers, but there is no upward trend nor are the numbers high \u2013 the range of such offences vary from two a year to seven a year in the last five years.",
      "32": "I therefore consider that deterrence was not a major factor in determining the sentence for the present case. The relevant parameters were the facts of the offence, although keeping in mind that it was perpetrated against a person belonging to a particularly vulnerable group. Wang had set out to rob a taxi driver, but there was no evidence of any intention to kill from the outset. Death was caused in the course of a struggle, one that Wang ought to have anticipated. The Prosecution made a rather uncharacteristic submission that there was \u201ca high degree of premeditation and planning\u201d, without stating that this was in relation to the offence of robbery and not the murder. This was puzzling because the finding of fact at both High Court and Court of Appeal was that the offence of murder was not premeditated. That submission only had the unfortunate effect of causing the media reports of the case to be misreported. As for the acts post-killing, there was a range of explanations for it, but Wang was entitled to the benefit of doubt that this was motivated by self-preservation after the fact and not cold-blooded intent. The aggravating factor in this case was the fact that he took cruel advantage of the desperation of the Victim\u2019s widow and tried to extort money from her while keeping up her hopes that the Victim was still alive. But again there was no evidence that this was pre-planned; indeed the evidence points to them being opportunistic acts. Wang deserved the full brunt of the law short of capital punishment. In my view, the ends of justice were served by a sentence of life imprisonment and, in view of the acts post-killing, to 24 strokes of the cane, which was the maximum sentence I can impose short of the death penalty.",
      "33": "For the reasons given above, I exercised my power under s 4(5)(g) of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act to re-sentence Wang to imprisonment for life and to 24 strokes of the cane."

      "2": "On appeal, the Court of Appeal in Kho Jabing v PP [2011] 3 SLR 634 (\u201cthe CA (Conviction) Decision\u201d) affirmed the Respondent\u2019s conviction and sentence. This CA (which for ease of reference will be referred to as \u201cCA (Conviction)\u201d), however, allowed Galing\u2019s appeal and his conviction of murder was substituted with a conviction of the offence of robbery with hurt committed in furtherance of a common intention under s 394 read with s 34 of the PC. Galing\u2019s case was then remitted back to the Trial Judge for resentencing and he was eventually sentenced to an imprisonment term of 18 years and six months and 19 strokes of the cane.",
      "3": "The Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 32 of 2012) (\u201cthe PCAA\u201d) was then enacted by Parliament to amend the PC. Pertinently, s 2 of the PCAA provide that:",
      "4": "As a result of these amendments, except for an accused person who is convicted of a charge under s 300(a) of the PC, an accused person will no longer face the mandatory death penalty and the court is given the discretion to sentence the accused to life imprisonment and caning instead.",
      "5": "Sections 4(5) and 4(6) of the PCAA then provided for certain transitional provisions:",
      "6": "On 30 April 2013, the Court of Appeal confirmed that the Respondent was convicted under s 300(c) of the PC and allowed his application for his case to be remitted to the High Court for re-sentencing pursuant to s 4(5)(f) of the PCAA.",
      "7": "The hearing for re-sentencing came before another High Court judge (as the Trial Judge had by then retired from the Bench) (\u201cthe Re-sentencing Judge\u201d), who re-sentenced the Respondent to life imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest (ie, 26 February 2008) and 24 strokes of the cane (see PP v Kho Jabing [2014] 1 SLR 973 (\u201cthe Re-sentencing Judge\u2019s Decision\u201d)).",
      "8": "The Prosecution then appealed against the Re-sentencing Judge\u2019s decision, urging this court to impose the death sentence upon the Respondent on the ground that this was an extremely vicious attack on the victim.",
      "9": "At the very heart of this appeal lies a critical legal question \u2013 for an offence of murder where the mandatory death penalty does not apply, in what circumstances would the death penalty still be warranted?",
      "10": "This seemingly simple question belies a great deal of difficulties and complications, along with the severe consequences and implications any answer brings. Given that this is the first case of its kind to reach the Court of Appeal since the amendments to the mandatory death penalty were enacted, previous case law was, at best, marginally helpful. In fact, both the Prosecution and counsel for the Respondent were hard-pressed, very understandably so, to suggest any local authority which might be helpful to us.",
      "11": "This appeal therefore requires this court to set down some guidelines and principles as to how this discretion ought to be exercised. After considering the submissions made by the Prosecution and counsel for the Respondent, we allow the Prosecution\u2019s appeal and impose the death sentence on the Respondent. Our detailed reasons for this decision are set out hereunder.",
      "12": "During the appeal, we had raised a number of queries to both the counsel for the Respondent and the Prosecution with the objective of clarifying exactly how the court should come to its decision as to the circumstances when the death penalty, as compared to life imprisonment and caning, would be the more appropriate sentence in a case like this. In sum, the numerous questions can be condensed into two broad questions which accurately capture our concerns:\n(a)     What circumstances should the court take into consideration?\n(b)     Do the normal sentencing principles apply?",
      "13": "Keeping these two questions in mind, we examine three areas which might be potentially helpful \u2013 (i) the parliamentary debates for the amendments to the mandatory death penalty, (ii) decisions of foreign jurisdictions, and (iii) analogous local case authorities.",
      "14": "Obviously the first matter which we ought to consider in this regard would be the parliamentary debates concerning the enactment of the PCAA. In the debates during the introduction of the amendments (see \u201cChanges to the Application of the Mandatory Death Penalty to Homicide Offences (Statement by Minister for Law)\u201d, Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (9 July 2012) vol 89), the Minister for Law explained that three factors would be relevant in deciding when the death penalty is appropriate:",
      "15": "In trying to show how the Re-sentencing Judge had erred, the Prosecution in their submissions for this appeal had analysed these three factors and then \u201ccategorised\u201d the circumstances of the case according to these three factors. While the Prosecution should not be faulted for doing so, in our opinion, we find that these factors are best considered in totality, and should serve as guiding considerations rather than distinct factors in deciding whether the death penalty is appropriate. As can be seen, the Minister for Law had explained these three factors in \u201cbroad terms\u201d, suggesting that a broad and holistic approach should be taken. At the risk of stating the obvious, the factual matrix and circumstances of each case would be extremely varied, and Parliament could not have intended a formulistic approach in applying these three factors in deciding whether or not the death penalty would be the appropriate sentence for a particular case.",
      "16": "In any event, these three factors, by their nature, do not lend themselves to a formulistic approach \u2013 these factors are clearly not \u201cobjective\u201d factors which can be \u201cmeasured\u201d or \u201cfulfilled\u201d. When counsel for the Respondent and the Prosecution were asked whether there were any objective factors which could guide the court in making its decision, both candidly admitted that apart from suggesting certain objective factors described by the courts of other jurisdictions, they were unable to state any \u201cobjective factors\u201d other than what the Minister for Law had stated in the parliamentary debates.",
      "17": "This further reinforces our view that deciding whether or not the death penalty is the appropriate sentence cannot be done in a formulistic manner, unlike, for example, establishing liability for a breach of the duty of care where there are specific elements of the tort which can be established. Therefore, in our opinion, the factors as explained in the parliamentary debates simply point to the general principle that the facts of the case must be considered in their totality in determining the appropriate sentence, and are not meant to be part of a legal test to establish when the death penalty would be appropriate. While there is no doubt that the court should take cognizance of the three factors, they must be considered alongside the whole plethora of circumstances prevailing in that case.",
      "18": "Next we examine the decisions from other jurisdictions where a similar discretionary death penalty for murder is also provided. Counsel for the Respondent, both in this appeal and during the re-sentencing hearing below, relied upon a number of decisions from other jurisdictions in submitting that when the court has the discretion to decide whether or not to impose the death penalty, it should only do so in the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d and the \u201crarest of the rare\u201d cases. In response to these submissions, the Re-sentencing Judge, at [38] of his decision ([6] supra), held that:",
      "19": "The criminal justice system of a country is the bedrock of a safe and orderly society and is designed to produce order and justice in the relationships between man and man and between man and state. It is at the very heart of a functional and flourishing society, and we cannot emphasise further that it must be built upon the society\u2019s cultural, moral, political and economic norms. This will be especially so for something as controversial and sensitive as the death penalty. On this perspective, we generally agree with the observations of the Re-sentencing Judge as stated above. That said, although decisions from other jurisdictions ought to be viewed with some degree of circumspection, they can, to a certain extent, still provide some guidance in working out our criminal justice system. After all, it is in the collective wisdom of man that perhaps each can find his own illuminating light to guide his path. It will therefore be beneficial to examine a number of decisions from other jurisdictions which have tried to work out a clear and practical approach in meting out the discretionary death penalty.",
      "20": "We start off first with India, from where our Penal Code finds its historical roots. In Bachan Singh v The State Punjab (1980) 2 SCC 684 (\u201cBachan Singh\u201d), the leading case in India on the discretionary death penalty, the Supreme Court of India held (at [209]):",
      "21": "The \u201crarest of rare\u201d principle laid down in Bachan Singh continues to be the guiding principle for the Indian courts applying the discretionary death penalty. It is important however to understand the legislative context in which this principle arose from. Originally, pursuant to s 367(5) of the 1898 Indian Code of Criminal Procedure (Act No V of 1898) (\u201c1898 CCP\u201d), the courts in India were mandated by statute to state reasons if the death penalty was not passed, whenever the accused was convicted of an offence with the discretionary death penalty. Section 367(5) of the 1898 CCP provided that:",
      "22": "A different position was however taken when the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure (Act 2 of 1974) (\u201c1973 CCP\u201d) was enacted. Section 354(3) of the 1973 CPC provided that:",
      "23": "The 1973 CCP therefore effectively reversed the position as it existed under the 1898 CCP \u2013 the Indian Court now has the duty to give special reasons if the sentence of death is imposed. Given this legislative change, it is therefore not surprising that the court in Bachan Singh was ready to find that it was only in the \u201crarest of rare\u201d cases that the death penalty should be imposed.",
      "24": "Shortly after Bachan Singh, the Supreme Court of India fine-tuned its approach as to what would be a \u201crarest of rare\u201d case. In Machhi Singh v State of Punjab (1983) 3 SCC 470 (\u201cMachhi Singh\u201d), the Supreme Court of India considered that five factors could be relevant. Four of them are:\n(a)     the manner of commission of the murder;\n(b)     the motive for the murder;\n(c)     the anti-social or abhorrent nature of the crime; and\n(d)     the magnitude of the crime.",
      "25": "At [33] to [36], it described the four factors as such:",
      "26": "The Supreme Court of India also felt that the \u201cpersonality of victim of murder\u201d would be a relevant factor. Eventually, the Supreme Court of India endorsed a \u201cbalance sheet\u201d approach (at [38(iv)]), where:",
      "27": "By identifying the factors above, it would appear that the Supreme Court of India was placing emphasis on both the crime and the criminal in evaluating the appropriateness of the death penalty. The \u201cbalance sheet\u201d approach in determining whether a case was the \u201crarest of the rare\u201d continued to apply for a period of time. It would later however transpire that there was much practical difficulty in applying this test. We do not propose to go through an extensive review of Indian case law, but suffice it to say that in Sangeet v State of Haryana (2013) 2 SCC 452, the Supreme Court of India discussed a number of cases ever since Bachan Singh ([18] supra), and found that there had been \u201clittle or no uniformity in the application of this approach\u201d (referring to the \u201cbalance sheet approach\u201d advocated in Machhi Singh). At [77], it conclusively did away with this balance sheet approach, stating that:",
      "28": "Clearly, while the \u201crarest of rare\u201d principle endorsed in Bachan Singh continues to be the guiding principle in India, its history has shown that the practical application of such a principle is fraught with difficulty.",
      "29": "We note that the \u201crarest of rare\u201d principle is not unique to India. In Trimmingham v R [2009] UKPC 25 (an appeal from the Court of Appeal of St Vincent and the Grenadines), the Privy Council likewise endorsed a similar principle. In observing that the approach a sentencing judge should follow in a case where the imposition of the death sentence is discretionary was relatively well-established by the Caribbean Courts, the Privy Council at [21] held that:",
      "30": "Given the additional requirement that there must be no reasonable prospect of reform of the offender and no other means by which to achieve the object of punishment, it could even be said that the Caribbean Courts apply a stricter test than the \u201crarest of the rare\u201d approach in India.",
      "31": "In the United States, a similar \u201crarest of the rare\u201d principle seems to apply. The death penalty is only awarded in the most extreme of circumstances \u2013 in Roper v Simmons 543 US 551 (2005) at 568, the US Supreme Court citing its previous decision in Atkins v Virginia 536 US 304 (2002) at 319, held that:",
      "32": "Furthermore, a non-exhaustive list of factors the US Courts must consider is also statutorily provided for in Title 18, Chapter 228, Section 3592 of the United States Code. These factors include impaired capacity, duress, minor participation, equally culpable defendants, heinous, cruel, or depraved manner of committing offense, pecuniary gain and substantial planning and premeditation, to name a few.",
      "33": "Finally, we turn to local case authorities. As mentioned above, this is the first case of its kind (brought about by the amendments to the PC \u2013 see [3] above) to be decided by us and there are no reported local case authorities directly on point. There is however, a decision based on the offence of gang-robbery with murder in the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cPC (1985)\u201d) which provides:",
      "34": "Section 396 of the PC (1985) which is similarly worded to s 302(2) of the PC (the provision under consideration in the present case), was interpreted and applied by the Court of Appeal in Panya Martmontree v PP [1995] 2 SLR(R) 806 (\u201cPanya\u201d). In dismissing the appeal and confirming the sentences of death passed by the High Court, the Court of Appeal at [66] noted that:",
      "35": "We note the strong language used by the Court of Appeal in Panya to describe the acts of the offenders in its decision to uphold the death penalty. Particularly, the Court of Appeal had used the phrase \u201coutrage the feeling[s] of the community\u201d in evaluating the acts of the offenders.",
      "36": "This phrase originated from the decision in Sia Ah Kew v PP [1974\u20131976] SLR(R) 54 (\u201cSia Ah Kew\u201d), which was cited with approval in Panya. Sia Ah Kew was a case involving kidnapping for ransom, an offence under s 3 of the Kidnapping Act (Cap 101, 1970 Rev Ed) which provided:",
      "37": "Here, the court likewise had the discretion in deciding whether or not to impose the death penalty. The Court of Appeal first noted at [3] that given the wording of the statute, the courts had:",
      "38": "In deciding when to impose the maximum penalty, that is, the death penalty, the Court of Appeal held at [5] that:",
      "39": "The Court of Appeal, after reviewing the facts of the case, eventually held that the circumstances did not point to a case where the maximum sentence of death would be the appropriate sentence to impose.",
      "40": "We will now review the points that we have raised above and set out our views as to their relevance in this appeal.",
      "41": "First, the three factors alluded to in the relevant parliamentary debates are non-exhaustive and are just guiding considerations which the court should bear in mind when determining whether the death penalty is an appropriate sentence in a specific case. In our opinion, the parliamentary debates do not suggest that the courts should only pay or pay particular credence to these three factors.",
      "42": "It is our judgment that the trite and well established sentencing principle that all the circumstances and factors of the case must be taken into consideration in meting out an appropriate sentence continues to apply, and this is supported by the fact that the Minister for Law had stated the three factors in broad terms and specifically mentioned that they were to be considered in totality. As we see it, these three factors were highlighted because they will very likely surface in any evaluation of a case involving the discretionary death penalty.",
      "43": "Second, the leading principle in other jurisdictions, as the survey above touching on the positions in India, St Vincent and Grenadines, and the United States shows, is that the death penalty should only be imposed for the \u201crarest of rare\u201d or the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d cases. To follow this principle would mean that it is only in the most extreme of circumstances and the narrowest of cases that the death penalty would be imposed. The practical implication of this principle can be illustrated briefly by a number of cases.",
      "44": "In Manohar Lal alias Mannu v State (NCT) of Delhi (2000) 2 SCC 92, the offenders burned four sons alive in front of their mother. On appeal, the death penalty was set aside because the Supreme Court of India felt that the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had \u201cblinded\u201d the offenders, leading them to a rampage triggered by a demented psyche. The offenders \u201chad no special or personal animosity towards anyone of the deceased individually\u201d (at [7]). Pertinently, the Supreme Court of India also (at [9]) cited a previous decision, Kishori v State of Delhi (1999) 1 SCC 148, where the facts were analogous and where the death penalty was not imposed.",
      "45": "In Ravindra Trimbak Chouthmal v State of Maharashtra (1996) 4 SCC 148, the victim was murdered, her head severed from her body, and her body cut up into nine pieces and kept in two suitcases which was subsequently disposed of. This was a case of \u201cdowry death\u201d, where the murder was the result of the husband\u2019s family being unhappy with the dowry received from the marriage. The Supreme Court of India overturned the High Court\u2019s decision to impose the death penalty, and at [9] and [10], observed that:",
      "46": "It is clear therefore that the \u201cnumber\u201d of occurrences of the crime features as a consideration in deciding what is the \u201crarest of the rare\u201d.",
      "47": "In our respectful opinion, we do not find that the \u201crarest of rare\u201d principle is appropriate for Singapore. To adopt this principle would be to artificially confine and sequester the death penalty to the narrowest of regions and to restrict the imposition of the death penalty based on whether the actions of the offender are \u201crare\u201d in comparison with other offenders. This should not be the case in our context. Admittedly, the often cited sentencing principle is that the maximum penalty is only intended for the worst form of cases (see for example, Sim Gek Yong v PP [1995] 1 SLR(R) 185 at [13], which was cited with approval in the Re-sentencing Judge\u2019s Decision ([6] supra) at [12]).",
      "48": "However, the context in which this principle was laid down is different in the sense that in the normal case the sentencing judge has a much wider discretion and a range of penalties from which to choose from. In such a scenario, given that there is a range of penalties reflecting differing degrees of moral culpability, it would make sense that it is only in the worst form of cases that the maximum penalty should be meted out. However, this is not the case with the discretionary death penalty. To quote the Court of Appeal in Sia Ah Kew ([32] supra) at [5], the \u201cdiscretion given to the courts as regards the sentence is ... very limited in scope\u201d; the court does not have the luxury to choose from a range of penalties.",
      "49": "Given the fact that the discretion is confined to only the imposition of either the death sentence or life imprisonment with caning, we do not find that the \u201crarest of the rare\u201d principle effectively meets the objective of having the discretionary death penalty in our sentencing regime. As explained by the Minister for Law in the parliamentary debates, the objective behind introducing the discretionary death penalty was to balance \u201cthe various objectives: justice to the victim, justice to society, justice to the accused, and mercy in appropriate cases\u201d. All these considerations must be taken into account, and we do not think that they would be properly reflected if we should adopt the \u201crarest of the rare\u201d principle.",
      "50": "In our judgment, a more appropriate principle to follow would be that laid down by the Court of Appeal in Sia Ah Kew, which is, whether the actions of the offender would outrage the feelings of the community. Undoubtedly, capital punishment is an expression of society\u2019s indignation towards particularly offensive conduct, and the fact that the death penalty continues to be part of our sentencing regime is an expression of society\u2019s belief that certain actions are so grievous an affront to humanity and so abhorrent that the death penalty may, in the face of such circumstances, be the appropriate, if not the only, adequate sentence. It would therefore, in our judgment, be correct to consider the strong feelings of the community in deciding whether or not to impose the death penalty.",
      "51": "In determining whether the actions of the offender would outrage the feelings of the community, we find that the death penalty would be the appropriate sentence when the offender has acted in a way which exhibits viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life. Viewed in this light, it is the manner in which the offender acted which takes centre stage. For example, in the case of a violent act leading to death, the savagery of the attack would be indicative of the offender\u2019s regard for human life. The number of stabs or blows, the area of the injury, the duration of the attack and the force used would all be pertinent factors to be considered.",
      "52": "We would observe that the significance of each of these factors would invariably vary, depending on the circumstances of the case. For example, the factors to consider would be extremely different in a case of non-violent acts leading to death, such as where the death was caused by poisoning. It is the offender\u2019s (dis)regard for human life which will be critical. This explains why an offence under s 300(a) of the PC, where the offender had the clear intention to cause death, still carries the mandatory death penalty.",
      "53": "Therefore when an offender acts in a way which exhibits a blatant disregard for human life which is just shy of the requisite intention to sustain a charge under s 300(a) of the PC, the imposition of the death penalty would be the appropriate sentence to reflect the moral culpability of such an offender. This approach would also be in accordance with what the Minister for Law had explained as being the seriousness of the offence, personal culpability of the accused and the manner in which the homicide occurred in the parliamentary debates.",
      "54": "That said, the court should still take into consideration all the other circumstances of the case. While the offender\u2019s regard for human life remains at the forefront of the court\u2019s consideration, other facts such as the offender\u2019s age and intelligence continue to be relevant.",
      "55": "In PP v Ellarry bin Puling [2011] SGHC 214 (\u201cFabian\u201d), F and E were foreigners on work permits in Singapore. On 22 August 2008, they set out on bicycles to find victims to rob. F was armed with a piece of wood which he had picked up the night before, with the intention of striking his victims with it before robbing them. In the early morning of 23 August 2008, F and E spotted the deceased sitting alone at a bus stop using his phone. F approached the person from behind and hit him on the head three times, before tripping him and kicking him when he was on the ground. The victim was then robbed. The victim later fell into a coma, and eventually succumbed to his injuries. The cause of death was certified to be intracranial haemorrhage and cerebral contusions due to a fractured skull. F was convicted of murder under s 300(c) of the PC.",
      "56": "F\u2019s conviction was upheld on appeal (in Criminal Case Appeal No 15 of 2011) and his case was subsequently sent back for resentencing under the relevant provisions of the PCAA. At the resentencing hearing (Criminal Case No 40 of 2009), the trial judge in that case found that although the attack was vicious, he took into account the fact that the accused was young (18 years old at the time of offence) and had sub-normal intelligence in eventually deciding not to impose the death penalty. This is an example of how the court must continue to take into consideration all the other circumstances of the case.",
      "57": "We summarise our views on the principles guiding this court in determining when it would be appropriate to impose the death penalty as follows:\n(a)     The factors alluded to by the Minister for Law in the parliamentary debates are clearly relevant considerations. However, no especial credence should be placed on them. The well-established sentencing principle that all the circumstances and factors of the case must be taken into consideration in meting out an appropriate sentence continues to apply.\n(b)     The \u201crarest of rare\u201d principle is not applicable in our legislative scheme of things. A more appropriate principle to follow would be the one laid down by the Court of Appeal in Sia Ah Kew ([32] supra), which is to discern whether the actions of the offender would outrage the feelings of the community.\n(c)     In determining whether the actions of the offender would outrage the feelings of the community and in turn warrant the imposition of the death penalty, the court must consider whether the offender has acted in a way which exhibits a blatant disregard for human life. Thus the manner in which the offender acted would be critical. The factors to be taken into consideration to determine this would vary depending on the circumstances of the case. In the case of a violent act leading to death, the savagery of the attack would be indicative of the offender\u2019s disregard for human life.\n(d)     In any event, all the circumstances of the case must be weighed including the motive and intention of the offender at the time he committed the offence. While the offender\u2019s regard for human life remains at the forefront of the court\u2019s consideration, other factors such as the offender\u2019s age and intelligence could well tilt the balance.",
      "58": "With these principles in mind, we now turn to consider the facts of the present appeal.",
      "59": "Central to our inquiry is the manner in which the Respondent had committed the murder. To do this would require revisiting the facts of the case. Keeping in mind the role of an appellate court and that, as far as possible, we should not be disturbing findings of fact, we turn first to the findings of facts concerning the attack as found in the Re-sentencing Judge\u2019s Decision ([6] supra), the CA (Conviction) Decision ([2] supra), and the Trial Judge\u2019s Decision ([1] supra). It is important to note that the Re-sentencing Judge had relied entirely on the Trial Judge\u2019s Decision and the CA (Conviction) Decision where the facts of the case were concerned. At [35] of his decision, the Re-sentencing Judge stated that:",
      "60": "He later concluded at [40(c)] of his decision that:",
      "61": "The Re-sentencing Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthere was no clear sequence of events concerning the attack\u201d was therefore his interpretation of the findings made by the CA (Conviction). At [8] to [10] of the CA (Conviction) Decision, the court had observed that:",
      "62": "Even though the accounts of the Respondent and Galing are clearly contradictory, neither the CA (Conviction) nor the Trial Judge made findings as to the exact sequence of events. Though unfortunate, this is understandable because at that point in time there was no need for the court to decide conclusively and exactly how the events took place as the charge against the Respondent and Galing was under s 300(c) of the PC. All that was needed for the Prosecution to prove was that the Respondent had intended to inflict the injury which led to the death of the deceased. As the law then stood, whether an accused was found guilty of an offence under s 300(a) or s 300(c), the punishment would be the same, ie, the death penalty.",
      "63": "We also note that the Re-sentencing Judge did not make any findings as to the number of times the Respondent had struck the deceased. There are however a number of observations concerning this in the CA (Conviction) Decision. After considering the statements given to the police by Galing, the CA (Conviction) observed at [25] to [27] that:",
      "64": "The paragraphs above, read together, clearly show that the CA (Conviction) found that the Respondent had struck the deceased on the head with severe force more than two times. Of course, as earlier explained, neither the CA (Conviction) nor the Trial Judge was required to make a specific finding as to the exact number of times the Respondent had struck the deceased on the head. We also note that the Trial Judge (at [24] to [28] of his decision) had made similar observations as to the medical evidence before him, but did not conclusively state the number of strikes the Respondent had inflicted upon the deceased:",
      "65": "The specific issue which we must now address is: do the facts discussed above show that the Respondent acted in a way which demonstrated a blatant disregard for human life in committing the murder? As we see it, two points can be made concerning the injuries that were inflicted upon the deceased.",
      "66": "First, although it is true that the sequence of events is unclear, we find that the Re-sentencing Judge had erred in finding ([6] supra) at [40(c)] that:",
      "67": "While it remains uncertain whether a struggle indeed occurred beforehand between Galing and the deceased, the evidence clearly shows that the Respondent had approached the deceased from behind and struck him without warning. In fact, the Respondent himself had admitted to this at various occasions during the trial. The following parts of the Respondent\u2019s evidence (given during oral testimony) are telling:\n(a)     First, on day 9 of the trial:\n(b)     Second, on day 10 of the trial:\n(c)     Third, on day 10 of the trial again:",
      "68": "Read together, even if it is assumed that there was a struggle between the deceased and Galing, there remains no doubt that the Respondent had admitted to coming from behind and hitting the deceased from the back. In our opinion, the Re-sentencing Judge had therefore erred by finding that there was no clear evidence showing that position. In any case, whether or not there was a struggle beforehand is of little significance to the Respondent\u2019s culpability, given how the injuries were eventually inflicted. First, it must be borne in mind that this alleged struggle was between the deceased and Galing, and not with the Respondent \u2013 any claims that the strikes were made \u201cin the heat of the moment\u201d would therefore be unpersuasive. Second, even if some consideration could be given to the fact that the Respondent was returning to \u201caid\u201d Galing, this might only explain the Respondent\u2019s first strike at best. However, it does little to explain or mitigate the additional strikes the Respondent dealt to the deceased given that after the first strike by the Respondent, the deceased had fallen onto the ground and was not retaliating. After the first blow, there was effectively no more struggle. Why was there a need to rain further blows on the head of the deceased then?",
      "69": "With this, we turn to our second point, which is the number of times the Respondent had struck the deceased. Throughout the proceedings, the Respondent maintained his position that he had struck the deceased only twice \u2013 once when he approached the deceased from the back (regardless of whether or not it was in the midst of a struggle), and once after the deceased had fallen down and turned over to the front. However, as mentioned above (at [56]), the CA (Conviction) found that the Respondent had taken more than two strikes at the deceased. In particular, the CA (Conviction) had considered Galing\u2019s statements to the police, where Galing had mentioned that he:",
      "70": "and also (in another statement) that:",
      "71": "For completeness, we note that during the trial, Galing changed his evidence to state that he had only seen Jabing strike the deceased once, and sought to explain that his police statements were recorded inaccurately. However, the Trial Judge was of the opinion that this allegation was unsustainable and found that the police officers had accurately recorded Galing\u2019s statements (see [47] of the Trial Judge\u2019s Decision ([1] supra)). This was noted and affirmed by the CA (Conviction) (see [25] of the CA (Conviction) Decision) ([2] supra).",
      "72": "As discussed above, the CA (Conviction) also took note of the evidence of the pathologist, Dr Teo Eng Swee (\u201cDr Teo\u201d), who testified that the skull fractures could have been caused by five impacts or more. Similar observations were made by the Trial Judge. However, during the hearing before us, counsel for the Respondent sought to persuade us that those observations were not conclusive of the number of strikes that the Respondent dealt, as it could not be said for certain that all five impacts (or more) were caused by the Respondent, ie, they could have been caused by other forces, such as a fall. As a result, counsel for the Respondent submitted that the benefit of doubt should be given to the Respondent and it should not be readily assumed that the Respondent had rained multiple strikes upon the deceased\u2019s head as submitted by the Prosecution. Between the two positions, counsel for the Respondent was trying to show that the Respondent had only struck the deceased twice or at the most thrice before running away, while the Prosecution was trying to show that the Respondent had mercilessly dealt blow after blow on the deceased even after he had fallen onto the ground.",
      "73": "In our opinion, the exact number of blows that the Respondent inflicted on the deceased and the manner in which they were carried out while certainly relevant to our inquiry are not necessarily decisive. As the Trial Judge and the CA (Conviction) did not have to (and thus did not) conclusively decide on how many blows the Respondent had inflicted on the deceased\u2019s head in coming to their decisions, and neither did the Re-sentencing Judge do so, we will first turn to the evidence surfaced during the trial itself to better understand and reconstruct what exactly happened on that fateful day (bearing in mind the very important point (see especially below at [77] and [78]) that such reconstruction cannot contradict (and, indeed, must be consistent with) the findings of fact already made by the CA (Conviction)).",
      "74": "We start with the observations made by Dr Teo that a \u201csevere force\u201d would be required in order to cause fragmentation of an intact skull. Commenting on the pattern of the fractures as found on the skull of the deceased, Dr Teo identified at least five \u201cseparate\u201d groups of fractures which he felt were due to separate impacts. However, he also qualified this by explaining that \u201conce the skull has been fractured, much less severe force is required to cause further fracturing of the skull\u201d. Therefore, Dr Teo said that he could not conclusively rule out the possibility that some fractures might have been caused by either a fall or the belt buckle. He did, however, express the view that the fractures were \u201cunlikely to be due to the belt buckle\u201d.",
      "75": "We also note that Dr Teo had highlighted certain \u201cunusual\u201d injuries on the deceased. These unusual injuries were either \u201cpaired\u201d or had \u201csome patterning\u201d to them. Dr Teo later explained that the \u201cpaired\u201d markings could be attributable to the pattern on the belt buckle, which was the face of the skull having two eyes and a nose which was slightly hooked. Critically, we further note that one of these unusual injuries was on the right eyebrow, which corresponded to one group of fractures on the skull of the deceased which Dr Teo identified (the other injuries with similar markings were found not on the head but on various other areas of the body of the deceased). Galing had also admitted that after he had returned to the scene, he had struck the deceased (at least) once before taking the deceased\u2019s phone and running away. Describing this, Galing mentioned that:",
      "76": "Galing, however, asserted that he could not remember exactly where he had struck the deceased.",
      "77": "We will now consider whether it is possible to determine the number of blows landed by the Respondent on the deceased\u2019s head. Starting first with the objective medical evidence alone, it could be said that, prima facie, the Respondent had landed at least five blows onto the head of the deceased \u2013 thus the five separate groups of fractures mentioned by Dr Teo. What raises doubt as to this prima facie position appear to be two matters. First is the allegation that the fall of the deceased onto the ground after the first blow by the Respondent could be the cause of some fractures. Second is the fact that at some later point Galing hit the deceased using his belt buckle.",
      "78": "On the first matter, it stands to reason that if the fall could cause a group of fractures, it would mean that the first blow by the Respondent onto the deceased\u2019s head must have been of such a tremendous force that it literally cracked the skull and weakened it so much so that just a fall could cause a further set of fractures. Even then, on the Respondent\u2019s own evidence, he went on to deliver a second blow to the deceased\u2019s head. What this means, is that even if we are to give the Respondent the benefit of the doubt and find that certain groups of fractures were attributable to a fall, in line with the severity of his first blow, it must follow that the second blow of the Respondent would also have been of considerable force. There was nothing to indicate that he had suddenly turned merciful as to lessen the force of the subsequent blow. Pausing here for a moment, and assuming that the Respondent had only inflicted two blows, the picture which emerges before us is a person, while his intention was only to rob the deceased, did not care at all whether his severe blows to the deceased would cause him to die. This is even more apparent considering that the Respondent had chosen to hit the deceased in an extremely vulnerable region, ie, his head.",
      "79": "Thereafter, we have the evidence of Galing where he said that he struck the deceased with his belt buckle. It is true that Dr Teo had opined that, once the skull is fractured, a much less severe force is required to cause further fracturing, and therefore, a strike from the belt buckle, after the Respondent had delivered the first severe blow, could very well have caused further fracturing, although he also had some reservations, stating that this would be unlikely (see [64] above). Galing testified that he had struck the deceased only once when he returned to the scene where the deceased and the Respondent were. Assuming that Galing was not involved in a struggle with the Respondent earlier, Galing\u2019s position cannot be true as there were multiple injuries with a pattern (see [65] above) on other parts of the deceased body (not the head) with only one injury with a pattern appearing on the right eyebrow of the Deceased. Taking these into consideration, all it means is that one set of fractures could possibly be attributed to the belt buckle, and even then, we hasten to add that Dr Teo had his reservations as to this possibility (the belt buckle causing a set of fractures). The net result is that, at the very most, one group of fractures would have been caused by the fall, and another group by the belt buckle. That leaves three more group of fractures to account for, leading us to draw the irresistible conclusion that the Respondent had struck the deceased at least three times on the head, which was also the finding of the CA (Conviction) when it held that that the Respondent had struck the deceased on the head more than twice (see [56] above).",
      "80": "Apart from the medical evidence, the only other evidence which suggests that the Respondent had struck the deceased multiple times are the statements of Galing to the police. As observed above, Galing had changed his evidence during oral testimony at the trial to state that he had only seen the Respondent strike the deceased once (which is even contrary to what the Respondent himself admitted).",
      "81": "We would only note that this claim of Galing that the statements were recorded inaccurately was rejected by both the Trial Judge and the CA (Conviction). The Trial Judge had the opportunity to observe Galing during his oral testimony and to draw his conclusions from that, and there is no reason why this court at this re-sentencing stage should refuse to accept that finding. There are obviously a variety of reasons why Galing could have been motivated to change his story at the trial to help the Respondent, and an exercise in speculation would be futile, bearing in mind that even the Respondent admitted that he had struck the deceased on the head twice. In the light of the totality of the evidence, we are satisfied that the Respondent had struck the deceased head with the tree branch with much force at least three times. We say \u201cat least\u201d because we have borne in mind Dr Teo had opined that it was unlikely that the belt buckle could have caused the fractures. More importantly, we have absolutely no doubt that when the Respondent landed the three blows on the head of the deceased, he did not care at all whether the blows would kill the latter.",
      "82": "We have focused thus far on the exact number of blows the Respondent had inflicted on the head of the deceased, although that is not the defining question that needs to be answered. The key question which we must answer is \u2013 did the Respondent act in a manner which showed a blatant disregard for human life? While, as we have stated above, that the question as to the number of blows which the Respondent had landed on the head of the deceased is not decisive, it remains very relevant to the key question. The following considerations are critical to our decision:\n(a)     First, we find that the Respondent had approached the deceased from behind, and struck him without any warning. Whether or not this was prefaced with a struggle, between Galing and the deceased, is of little significance to the Respondent\u2019s culpability. After the first blow was inflicted which caused the Respondent to fall to the ground, there was effectively no more struggle.\n(b)     Second, after the deceased fell to the ground after the first blow and then turned around to face upwards, the Respondent struck him once more. It is not disputed that the Respondent was not retaliating. In our judgment, we are of the view that the Respondent continued to hit the deceased at the very least two more times, before leaving the scene. When Galing returned to the scene after chasing Wu Jun he hit the Deceased with his belt buckle.\n(c)     In any case, even if the Respondent\u2019s assertion that he had only struck the deceased twice is to be believed and accepted, then the force he exerted in the two blows must have been so great as to cause fracturing of such severity and magnitude, so much so that a fall, or a strike with Galing\u2019s belt buckle, could have caused further fracturing.",
      "83": "In our judgment, and consistent with the finding of CA (Conviction), the Respondent had struck the deceased on the head not once, but at least three times altogether. Even if the Respondent did not intend to hit the deceased on his head the first time when the Respondent approached the deceased from the back (we would only add that we cannot see how that could be the case since he approached the deceased stealthily from the back and there was no evidence that the deceased had dodged), we cannot accept that, after the deceased fell and then turned round facing upwards, the Respondent likewise was unaware that he was going to hit the head of the deceased. Given the manner in which the attack was carried out, this was not a case where the Respondent had merely hoped to disable his victim in order to rob him of his belongings. Neither was this a case where the injuries were sustained in the course of a fight or a struggle. This was a case where even after the deceased was no longer retaliating (after the first blow), the Respondent went on to strike the deceased an additional number of times, completely unnecessary given that his initial intention was merely to rob him. In light of the sheer savagery and brutality exhibited by the Respondent, we are completely satisfied that the Respondent exhibited a blatant disregard for human life in the way he attacked the deceased.",
      "84": "At [40(c)] of his decision ([6] supra), the Re-sentencing Judge observed that the Respondent was relatively young, being 24 years of age, at the time of the offence. The Re-sentencing Judge also rightly observed that the Respondent was not as young as the convicted person in Fabian ([49] supra) (who was 18 years of age). In our opinion, the Respondent\u2019s age (at 24 and not 18 as the offender in Fabian) is at best a neutral factor, and does little to change the gravity of the case. The Re-sentencing Judge had also observed (at [40(a)] of his decision) that the Respondent\u2019s choice and use of the piece of wood was \u201copportunistic and improvisational\u201d, citing the CA (Conviction) Decision ([2] supra) at [35(b)]. Likewise, we found this to be at best a neutral factor, given the way and manner the attack was eventually carried out. The fact that the choice of weapon happened to be opportunistic pales in comparison with the savage and callous manner in which the Respondent had wielded it.",
      "85": "The difference in views between the majority and the minority is a matter of fact and not of law. As a matter of law, there is a concurrence in views on the test that is to be employed in determining when the death penalty should be imposed. It is common ground, however, that the disagreement is one of fact. Particularly, we note that the minority found that there was insufficient evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the Respondent had hit the deceased on the head at least three or more times, or that the Respondent had hit the deceased with such huge force as to cause most of the fractures in the deceased\u2019s skull. Given this insufficiency, the minority was of the opinion that therefore, the threshold of the test (ie, whether the Respondent had acted in a way which exhibits viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life), had not been crossed.",
      "86": "In order to reach their conclusion, the minority undertook an extensive review of the evidence that had surfaced during the very first trial. That being so, we emphasise that since this appeal arises from a re-sentencing proceeding pursuant to the PCAA, the first port of call must be the CA (Conviction) Decision. The findings of fact made by that court should not be revisited in the present proceedings. Indeed (and for the avoidance of doubt), all the issues as well as concerns raised by the minority were also raised by counsel during the hearing before the CA (Conviction) and were ruled upon by that court. We wish to highlight that at the hearing before CA (Conviction), Jabing\u2019s counsel had submitted, inter alia, the following points:\n(a)     \u201c... there was no way that [Jabing] could have caused the 14 or so fractures which Dr Teo testified about\u201d;\n(b)     \u201c[f]or the 14 fractures to happen dispersed over the head of the deceased there must have been several strikes on the deceased\u2019s head and definitely more than two\u201d;\n(c)     \u201c... there is a strong possibility that Galing did not only use the belt buckle but also the piece of wood which Jabing had discarded when fleeing the scene\u201d;\n(d)     \u201c... there is a doubt that it was [Jabing] who caused those injuries which resulted in the death of the deceased\u201d.",
      "87": "Admittedly, as that court was dealing with the pre-amendment position, there was no reason for it to assess the savagery (or otherwise) of the Respondent\u2019s actions; put simply, it was merely making its findings of fact based on the evidence and submissions raised by the counsel concerned. Clearly, the CA (Conviction) had found that the Respondent had inflicted more than two blows on the head of the deceased. As the law then stood, there was no need for the court to be more specific then. What is also clear is that the court did not accept the Respondent\u2019s counsel suggestion that Galing could also have used the piece of wood discarded by the Respondent to hit the deceased, because the court acquitted Galing of the murder charge and instead convicted him of only the offence of robbery with hurt.",
      "88": "What this court ought to be concerned about in the present proceeding is whether based on those findings of fact, the discretion ought (or ought not) to be exercised in favour of the Respondent under the (amended) s 302(2) brought about by the PCAA.",
      "89": "Viewed in this light, in this proceeding, this court should only supplement the findings of the CA (Conviction) with further findings of fact to the extent \u2013 and only to the extent \u2013 that the CA (Conviction) had been silent and/or ambiguous on matters that are germane to the resolution of the present appeal. As stated above, the CA (Conviction) had accepted Galing\u2019s statements and found \u201cthat Jabing struck the deceased more than twice, and with considerable violence\u201d [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]. We would reiterate that Galing\u2019s attempt to question the accuracy of his statements at trial was rejected by both the Trial Judge and the CA (Conviction). Having scrutinised the evidence, the CA (Conviction) concluded (at [27]) that:",
      "90": "With the greatest respect, the minority have embarked on a total reconsideration of all the findings of fact made by the CA (Conviction); they have, in effect, not only re-opened as well as questioned those findings but also sought to reverse them. Indeed, if the analysis in these judgments is taken to its logical conclusion, there might be at least a strong case for finding that the Respondent ought not to have even been convicted under s 300(c) in the first place. Even if we were to accept the position that it was unclear as to how many times the Respondent had struck the head of the deceased, what is vitally important to bear in mind is that what we have here was a completely shattered skull. Bearing in mind the fact that the alleged intention of the Respondent and Galing was merely to rob the deceased, what the Respondent did underscores the savagery of the attack which was characterised by needless violence that went well beyond the pale.",
      "91": "Returning to our position, as we have observed, at the very least, the Respondent had chosen to strike the deceased with such immense force at an extremely vulnerable region, so much so that a simple fall or a strike from a buckle could have led to further shattering. To us, this alone, already shows the Respondent\u2019s complete disregard of human life. To say that the fall (after the first blow by the Respondent) and the hit by Galing on the deceased\u2019s right eyebrow with the use of the buckle could have caused further fractures and thus mitigated the viciousness of the attack is, with respect, a non-plus to us. The evidence is clear \u2013 severe force, from more than two blows, had caused the kind of fractures which were found on the head of the deceased.",
      "92": "The result of the amendments to the mandatory death penalty regime is that, in certain circumstances, it is the court who is now the final arbiter of whether an offender is deserving of the ultimate penalty. The punishment of death is an unusually severe punishment in its finality and enormity. The irrevocability of this punishment demands that in the exercise of this discretion, the court should be guided by clear and practicable principles in order to prevent any form of capriciousness and arbitrariness.",
      "93": "At the same time, we recognise that the nature of the crime is such that it does not lend itself to a situation where the court could lay down a set of specific objective factors which are determinative. By its very nature, what would constitute a blatant disregard of human life would be very fact-sensitive. The punishment of a crime must be proportionate to the gravity of the crime.",
      "94": "In our judgment, the punishment of death will be appropriate when the offender had committed the murder in a manner which clearly demonstrates a blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life. In this appeal, the Respondent had struck the deceased in a vulnerable region (the head). We find (as did the CA (Conviction) in dismissing his appeal against conviction) that the Respondent had struck at the deceased\u2019s head at least three times. Although it is impossible to reconstruct exactly what had occurred on that fateful day, given the evidence before us, we are inclined to think that the Respondent had struck the deceased more times than that.",
      "95": "While the possibility of additional injuries being caused by another force cannot be conclusively ruled out (for example, by the belt buckle of Galing or a fall), in our judgment, the medical evidence clearly shows that the fatal blows are attributable to the Respondent. The sheer savagery and brutality displayed by the Respondent shows that during the course of the attack, the Respondent just simply could not care less as to whether the deceased would survive although his intention at the time was only to rob. He did not stop attacking the deceased even after the latter was incapacitated and was no more in a position to respond after the first blow. His actions were utterly vicious.",
      "96": "In the result, we find that the Respondent had shown a blatant disregard for human life. Therefore, we allow the Prosecution\u2019s appeal and impose the death penalty on the Respondent.",
      "97": "At the invitation of Woo Bih Li J, I am delivering my judgment ahead of him. I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of my learned colleagues, Chao Hick Tin JA, Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA and Chan Seng Onn J (\u201cthe Majority Judgment\u201d). In the paragraphs that follow, I have adopted the nomenclature in the Majority Judgment, save that I refer to the Respondent as \u201cJabing\u201d.",
      "98": "The key issue in this appeal is whether the death penalty should be imposed on Jabing under s 302(2) of the PC. I should state at the outset that I respectfully agree with the analysis in the Majority Judgment of the law in relation to the imposition of the death penalty on a charge under s 300(c), and punishable under s 302(2), of the PC. In particular, I agree that the \u201crarest of rare\u201d principle is not appropriate for Singapore (see [43] above). I agree with the formulation of the test set out in the Majority Judgment at [44] above, ie, it is a question of whether the offender\u2019s acts are \u201cso grievous an affront to humanity and so abhorrent\u201d that the death penalty is the only adequate sentence. I also am further in complete agreement that, in the context of the present case, capital punishment would be appropriate where the offender had \u201cacted in a way which exhibits viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life\u201d (see the Majority Judgment at [45] above).",
      "99": "As is usually the case in these matters, the outcome of the appeal hinges on the findings of fact. It is solely in relation to the findings of fact that I must respectfully depart from the Majority Judgment. I now give the reasons for my dissent on this point.",
      "100": "Prior to the enactment of the PCAA, all that the Prosecution was required to prove in a trial on charge under s 300(c) was that the accused had intentionally inflicted the injury on the deceased, which injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. It was neither necessary for the conviction nor the sentence to prove any details of the acts of the accused beyond this. While evidence of the accused\u2019s intention to inflict the fatal injury would be found in the manner in which he had attacked the deceased, in certain circumstances it is possible for an accused to be convicted without evidence providing a blow-by-blow account of the incident. The fact that such evidence is not before the court is often not due to the fault of the Prosecution. Very often, as was the situation in the present case, there are no witnesses available to give this evidence. If there is evidence to prove all the elements of the offence, the lack of a detailed account of the incident will not stand in the way of a conviction under s 300(c). And once a person is convicted under s 300(c) of the PC, under the previous incarnation of s 302 of the PC, the only punishment that could be imposed was the death penalty. However, with the amendment brought about by the PCAA, the new s 302(2) of the PC gave the court the discretion to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment (with or without caning). As a result of this legislative change, the details of the attack on the deceased by an accused person became crucial on the issue of sentence, even though it was not at the time of the trial.",
      "101": "The problem in this case lies with the fact that we are now trying to reconstruct, from the evidence given under those circumstances, the sequence of events in order to determine the extent of Jabing\u2019s role in causing the death of the deceased. However difficult the task may be, it must be done on the basis of the criminal standard of proof, ie, beyond a reasonable doubt. Where any evidence is ambiguous, the benefit of the doubt must be given to Jabing. Some of these ambiguities could have been resolved had the relevant witnesses been asked questions at the trial from this point of view; but this was not done and we can only look at the evidence at hand and make such findings of fact as we can based on the criminal standard of proof. In my view this court is entitled to revisit any findings of fact made in the CA (Conviction) Decision ([2] supra) in view of this crucial difference in the nature of the inquiry pointed out in the preceding paragraph.",
      "102": "I shall first examine the two key findings of fact in the Majority Judgment upon which the majority of this court concluded that Jabing had acted in blatant disregard for human life. These are (a) Jabing had approached the deceased from behind without warning, and (b) Jabing had struck the deceased in the head at least three times (as stated in [70] of the Majority Judgment) and with such force as to cause most of the extensive fractures found in the deceased\u2019s skull. I intend to show that there is insufficient evidence to find beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had caused most of the skull fractures (either by multiple strikes or two strikes with huge force). Following that, I shall set out the findings of fact which this court can find to be established beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence before the trial court, upon which the sentencing decision should be based. My conclusion is that, based on this set of facts, it cannot be concluded that Jabing had acted in blatant disregard of human life.",
      "103": "On this first question, in my opinion there is sufficient evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had approached the deceased from behind without warning and hit the deceased in the head. There is clear and consistent evidence from the factual witnesses even though the medical evidence is, at best, neutral on this point.",
      "104": "Jabing\u2019s evidence is that he approached the deceased from behind without warning and struck him in the head.",
      "105": "It was recorded in Jabing\u2019s statement dated 4 March 2008 that:",
      "106": "Jabing had also admitted at least three times during the trial that he approached the deceased from the back:\n(a)     30 July 2009, p 60, line 31:\n(b)     31 July 2009, p 23, line 32:\n(c)     31 July 2009, p 43, line 32:",
      "107": "Apart from whether there was a struggle between the deceased and Galing, Jabing\u2019s evidence on this point is consistent with Galing\u2019s evidence in his statements and during the trial. I now turn to consider Galing\u2019s evidence on this point.",
      "108": "It was recorded in Galing\u2019s statements that he saw Jabing approach the deceased from behind and hit him with the wood:\n(a)     Statement dated 26 February 2008:\n(b)     Statement dated 3 March 2008:",
      "109": "Galing\u2019s statements were consistent with his evidence during the trial:\n(a)     27 July 2009, p 11, line 17:\n(b)     27 July 2009, p 32, line 23:",
      "110": "To some extent, the evidence of Jabing and Galing (ie, that Jabing approached the deceased from behind) is consistent with Wu Jun\u2019s account of the attack. Wu Jun\u2019s evidence would suggest that:\n(a)     Wu Jun was attacked by Galing using the belt buckle from behind. This is based on Wu Jun\u2019s evidence that he was hit once by something hard at the back of his head (near his left ear), which he thought was a chain, and that he saw his assailant with \u201ca clenched fist\u201d [emphasis added] and \u201craising his hand as if he was going to attack me\u201d [emphasis added].\n(b)     The initial strike to the deceased was by Jabing. This can be inferred from Wu Jun\u2019s evidence that he heard his friend groaning as if he was in pain shortly after he was attacked by Galing. The logical conclusion, given that Jabing and Galing were the only two assailants, was that Jabing was the one who struck the deceased.\n(c)     Jabing did not approach the deceased from the front. This can be inferred from Wu Jun\u2019s evidence that he was walking beside the deceased, and he did not see any other person apart from his assailant (which was identified as Galing).",
      "111": "While Wu Jun does not say specifically that he saw Jabing approach the deceased from behind and hitting him in the head, his account of the attack is consistent with the evidence of Galing and Jabing (apart from the alleged struggle).",
      "112": "There is, however, one concern that ought to be addressed here, that is, the medical evidence is neutral on whether the deceased was struck in the head from behind.",
      "113": "The evidence of Dr Teo Eng Swee (forensic pathologist) and Dr Ho Chi Long (neurosurgeon) would suggest that the deceased might not have suffered a direct blow to the back of his head. Dr Teo\u2019s evidence was that he could not rule out the possibility that fracture (14) at the back of the head might have been caused by a fall. On the other hand, Dr Ho took the view that fracture (14) could have been an extension of the fractures on the left side of the skull.",
      "114": "However, this may not necessarily be inconsistent with the fact that Jabing had approached the deceased from behind without warning. The deceased could well have turned his head to the side when Jabing approached from the back such that Jabing\u2019s initial strike landed on the side instead of the back of the deceased\u2019s head. Indeed, it is not difficult to imagine that the deceased might have heard someone approaching from behind and wanted to turn around to see who it was. It is also possible that the initial strike by Jabing to the deceased\u2019s head did not cause any fractures. It should be noted that Dr Teo could not give evidence of the order in which the injuries were sustained (except that fracture (8) might have occurred after the other fractures). Accordingly, the medical evidence neither proves nor dispels the proposition that Jabing approached the deceased from behind without warning.",
      "115": "While the medical evidence does not show that the deceased was struck in the back of the head, it may not necessarily be inconsistent with the fact that Jabing had crept up behind the deceased without warning and attacked him. More importantly, there is clear and consistent evidence from all three key factual witnesses (ie, Jabing, Galing and Wu Jun) that would support a finding beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had approached the deceased from behind without warning and hit him on the head.",
      "116": "In my view, there is insufficient evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had hit the deceased on the head at least three times, or that Jabing had hit the deceased with such huge force as to cause most of the fractures in the deceased\u2019s skull. The evidence would, taken at the highest, show that Jabing had hit the deceased in the head twice and caused the skull to fracture.",
      "117": "I shall consider firstly, the evidence relating to the number of blows sustained by the deceased, and secondly, the evidence on the number of blows inflicted by Jabing.",
      "118": "For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the evidence only supports a finding that deceased sustained two blows to the head. This comes primarily from Jabing\u2019s evidence (see [107] below). The medical evidence does not establish beyond reasonable doubt the exact number of strikes that the deceased sustained or if the deceased in fact sustained more than two strikes to the head (see, in particular, [111] and [121] below).",
      "119": "The evidence of Jabing, Galing and Wu Jun would not support a finding of fact that the deceased sustained more than two strikes to the head:\n(a)     Wu Jun\u2019s evidence suggests that the deceased was struck but not necessarily on the head. This is because Wu Jun only heard the deceased groaning in pain shortly after he was assaulted by Galing.\n(b)     Jabing\u2019s evidence, both in his statements and during the trial, was that he had only hit the deceased twice. While it was recorded in Jabing\u2019s statements that he saw Galing hit the deceased with the belt buckle, he did not mention the number of times. In one of his statements, Jabing was recorded as having said that he was not sure how many times Galing hit the deceased. At trial, Jabing said that he did not see Galing hit the deceased. On Jabing\u2019s evidence, then, the deceased would have only been hit in the head twice.\n(c)     Galing\u2019s evidence suggests that the deceased sustained one or two blows. Galing\u2019s evidence was that he had only hit the deceased once either in the chest or head. As for the number of times Jabing hit the deceased, Galing changed his evidence during the trial to say, consistently, that he only saw Jabing hit the deceased once.",
      "120": "Based on the evidence of Jabing, Galing and Wu Jun, the deceased would have sustained only two blows to the head.",
      "121": "The key issue is whether the medical evidence supports the finding that the deceased sustained at least five direct strikes to the head. Neither Dr Teo nor Dr Ho could state the exact number of blows sustained by the deceased, but merely concluded that it would take \u201cseveral blows\u201d or a \u201chuge force\u201d.",
      "122": "Firstly, the medical evidence does not support a finding that the skull fractures were caused by five impacts or more (see Majority Judgement at [45] and [47]; PP v Galing Anak Kujat [2010] SGHC 212 at [26]; Kho Jabing v PP [2011] 3 SLR 634 at [26]). A closer look at the Notes of Evidence would show that Dr Teo had identified not only five but a total of eight points of impact:\n(a)     First, the laceration above the left eyebrow/forehead region and the fragmentation of the skull suggest blunt force impact.\n(b)     Second, fractures (5) and (6) indicate an impact on the right side of the skull.\n(c)     Third, fractures (2), (3), (4) and (7) could be due to one impact or more.\n(d)     Fourth, fracture (8) could be due to a separate impact.\n(e)     Fifth, fracture (1), which is a comminuted fracture of the frontal bone above the right eye, is probably due to another impact. Fracture (12) could have been a continuation of fracture (1) as well.\n(f)     Sixth, fracture (9), which is a V-shaped fracture, could be due to another impact.\n(g)     Seventh, fracture (14) could be due to another impact (Dr Teo said he does not exclude that it might be due to a fall).\n(h)     Eighth, the fragmentation on the left side of the skull (where the left-sided craniectomy was performed) could be due to one or more impacts. However, fractures (10), (11), (12) and (13) at the base of the skull could have been \u201ccontinuations of the fractures\u201d from the part of the skull where the craniectomies were performed.",
      "123": "More importantly, however, Dr Teo ended that discussion with an important caveat that did not appear to have been picked up in any of the previous proceedings:",
      "124": "Dr Teo also explained that \u201c[o]ne impact may cause multiple fractures but the impact would have to be of very great force\u201d. To be fair, Dr Teo did say subsequently during re-examination that, in his view, one blow with a blunt object would not have caused all the fractures present in this case. Nevertheless, it should be noted that Dr Teo did not go on to say the number of blows that it would have taken to cause the fractures. He certainly did not say specifically that the deceased sustained five direct blows to the head.",
      "125": "Secondly, Dr Teo did not have the opportunity to examine the entire skull of the deceased during autopsy as significant parts of it had been removed during the two craniectomies that were performed on the deceased. As a result of the injuries caused to the head which led to cerebral oedema (ie, swelling of the brain), the deceased had to undergo decompressive craniectomy twice. During the trial, Dr Teo\u2019s evidence was as follows:",
      "126": "This is consistent with Dr Ho\u2019s evidence on what was done to the removed part of the deceased\u2019s skull:",
      "127": "Dr Ho\u2019s evidence is pertinent as he was the doctor who attended to the deceased during the surgery. Dr Ho explained that the part of the skull removed during the left-sided craniectomy was in \u201cmultiple fragments\u201d and that it would have required \u201cvery huge force\u201d to cause such an injury. Significantly, Dr Ho took the view that some of the other fractures may have been extensions of the fracture caused by the blow(s) to the left side of the skull:",
      "128": "For the fractures on the right side of the skull, Dr Ho said that:",
      "129": "As for the back of the skull, Dr Ho\u2019s view was that:",
      "130": "Three observations can be made here.",
      "131": "First, Dr Ho\u2019s opinion is that some of the fractures on the back and front of the skull may not have been caused by direct blows, but could have been an extension of the fractures caused by blow(s) to the left side of the deceased skull where the craniectomy was performed.",
      "132": "Second, Dr Teo considered that the fractures to the deceased\u2019s skull could have been caused by distinct blows, but he arrived at the conclusion without having the opportunity to examine the deceased\u2019s skull in its entirety (see [113] above). Unfortunately, Dr Teo was not asked if he agreed with Dr Ho\u2019s opinion that the other fractures could have been extensions from the fracture to the left side of the skull where the craniectomy was performed. However, Dr Teo does not appear to disagree with the possibility that certain fractures could have been extensions of the fractures to the left side of the skull; in fact, he was of the view that fractures (10), (11), (12) and (13) at the base of the skull (that is, the part which is in contact with the bottom of the brain) could have been \u201ccontinuations of the fractures\u201d from the part of the skull where the craniectomy was performed.",
      "133": "For completeness, I should add that even though Dr Ho suggested several times during the trial that the fractures would require several blows, he could not be certain and eventually acknowledged that he can only say that it was a \u201chuge force\u201d. Like Dr Teo, he could not specify the number of blows that would have been necessary in order to cause such fractures.",
      "134": "Third, it cannot be ruled out that some of the fractures could have been caused by indirect force, eg, the deceased falling and knocking his head against the ground. Dr Teo does not rule out the possibility that at least one of the fractures (ie, fracture (14), at the back of the skull) might have been caused by a fall. Dr Ho also makes the point that the fracture to the right side of the skull (ie, fractures (5) and (6), at the right side of the skull) could possibly have been caused by the deceased knocking himself on the ground:",
      "135": "Even though Dr Ho subsequently testified that it is \u201cimpossible just a simple fall can cause that severe injury\u201d, it was an answer in response to counsel\u2019s question whether the injuries suffered by the deceased could have been as a result of \u201ca fall or several falls\u201d. It should not be understood to mean that Dr Ho is saying that none of the fractures might have been caused by a fall.",
      "136": "From the analysis above, it is clear that the medical evidence does not support the finding of fact that the deceased sustained at least five direct strikes to the head. There is a possibility that some of the fractures were caused by indirect force like a fall. There is also a possibility that some of the fractures were extensions of the fractures on the left side of the skull. Significantly, Dr Teo\u2019s evidence was based on his assessment of the incomplete skull (due to the craniectomies). In any event, neither Dr Teo nor Dr Ho was able to specify the number of blows that would have been necessary to cause the skull fractures sustained by the deceased.",
      "137": "If it is accepted that there is insufficient evidence to establish that the deceased has sustained more than two blows to the head, then it follows that there cannot be a finding that Jabing had inflicted three or more blows to the deceased\u2019s head.",
      "138": "I now move on to the next point, ie, there is insufficient evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had inflicted more than two strikes to the deceased\u2019s head.",
      "139": "The evidence of Jabing, Galing and Wu Jun on the number of blows inflicted by Jabing on the deceased\u2019s head have been discussed above (at [107]) and they can be summarised as follows:\n*evidence changed during trial",
      "140": "It is apparent that the evidence of Jabing, Galing and Wu Jun, without more, would only show that Jabing had, at best, struck the deceased on his head two times. It should be recalled that Wu Jun had only heard the deceased groaning in pain ([107(a)] above), but this might not have been caused by a blow to the head. Jabing had confessed to having struck the deceased in his head twice and no more. The only point of contention lies with Galing\u2019s evidence. As discussed earlier ([107(c)] above), Galing had changed his evidence during trial to say that he only saw Jabing hit the deceased in the head once. The crucial question is whether it is safe to rely on Galing\u2019s statements to support the finding that Jabing had hit the deceased multiple times in the head with the wood.",
      "141": "For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that little weight should be placed on Galing\u2019s statements in relation to the number of times Galing saw Jabing hit the deceased in the head.",
      "142": "It is commonly accepted that the evidence of a co-accused (like Galing) would have to be treated with caution as he may lie or distort the truth to preserve his own interests. In Chin Tet Yung, \u201cCriminal Procedure Code 2010: Confessions and Statements by Accused Persons Revisited\u201d [2012] 24 SAcLJ 60 at para 53, the learned author stated that:",
      "143": "Galing\u2019s statements consistently and unequivocally stated that he saw Jabing hit the deceased on the head multiple times, while at the same time played down his own role by saying that he only hit the deceased once in the \u201cfront part of the body\u201d. It should be noted that Galing later admitted during the trial that he might have hit the deceased once either in the chest or head.",
      "144": "Based on Galing\u2019s statements and his testimony in court alone, there is no way to ascertain if he did see Jabing hit the deceased on the head multiple times. In fact, there is every reason to doubt Galing\u2019s version of facts in those statements given that they are exculpatory in nature as he had every reason to play down his role. Unless it can be shown that Galing\u2019s evidence in court should not be accepted for some reason, there is no basis to prefer Galing\u2019s statements over his testimony in court. This necessitates an examination into Galing\u2019s change of evidence during trial.",
      "145": "In the witness box, Galing retreated from the position he took in the statements and explained at trial repeatedly (at least eight times) and consistently that he only saw Jabing hit the deceased once. It should be noted that Galing\u2019s volte-face during the trial is not favourable to him, since it could lead to the inference that he was the one who inflicted the injuries suffered by the deceased. Indeed, Galing had maintained during the trial that he only saw Jabing hit the deceased once, very shortly after the Prosecution had suggested to him that the most of the fractures must have been inflicted by Jabing if he had only hit the deceased once. This would have alerted Galing to the fact that his evidence on this point might not be advantageous to his case. Despite this, Galing maintained throughout the trial that he only saw Jabing hit the deceased on the head once.",
      "146": "Galing\u2019s initial explanation to the change in evidence is found in the following exchange:",
      "147": "Galing repeated at least five more times, when cross-examined by the Prosecution, that he told the investigating officer recording his statements that he saw Jabing hit the deceased on the head repeatedly:\n(a)     29 July 2009, p 8, line 6:\n(b)     29 July 2009, p 11, line 32:\n(c)     29 July 2009, p 12, line 11:\n(d)     29 July 2009, p 15, line 23:\n(e)     29 July 2009, p 16, line 16:",
      "148": "Later, Galing appeared to change his position on at least four occasions when examined by his counsel:\n(a)     29 July 2009, p 40, line 1:\n(b)     29 July 2009, p 41, line 7:\n(c)     29 July 2009, p 45, line 18:\n(d)     29 July 2009, p 56, line 13:",
      "149": "At first blush, there appears to be an inconsistency \u2013 this was picked up by the Trial Judge:",
      "150": "With the benefit of considering the entirety of Galing\u2019s evidence as set out above, I am of the view that there is no real inconsistency. It seems that what Galing was trying to say was that he told the officer that he saw Jabing hit the deceased once but later (for whatever reason) accepted the officer\u2019s suggestion that he saw Jabing hit the deceased repeatedly, and only the latter was recorded in his statements.",
      "151": "On this point, it should also be noted that Galing\u2019s counsel had confirmed that Galing would rely on the statements without qualifications for his defence, and that the statements were made voluntarily even though some parts may not have been properly recorded.",
      "152": "As a result of Galing\u2019s change in evidence, the recording officers and interpreter were recalled and cross-examined on this point. Unfortunately, the cross-examination did not reveal much. They merely testified that there was no suggestion made to Galing on the number of times that Jabing had hit the deceased and that the statements were accurately recorded. Therefore, they do not assist in determining if Galing was telling the truth in the statements or during the trial.",
      "153": "Even if we accept that the statements were properly recorded, it does not necessarily mean that full weight should be given to the contents of the statements. It is possible that Galing told the officers that he saw Jabing hit the deceased multiple times in the head even though that may not be the truth. In fact, Galing would have every reason to lie in the statements in order to exculpate himself, especially if, according to him, the officers had made certain suggestions which were favourable to him. Galing\u2019s explanation for his change in evidence during the trial is not incredible, and it follows that the change in evidence per se is not sufficient basis to prefer Galing\u2019s evidence in the statements to his evidence in court.",
      "154": "I move on to consider an alternative basis that might explain why Galing\u2019s evidence in the statements should be preferred over his evidence in court, namely, the possibility of collusion between Jabing and Galing.",
      "155": "Both Galing and Jabing had changed their evidence during trial in favour of each other:\n(a)     Jabing said he did not see Galing hit the deceased, even though it was recorded in his statements that he saw Galing hit the deceased; and\n(b)     Galing said he only saw Jabing hit the deceased once, even though it was recorded in his statements that he saw Jabing hit the deceased repeatedly.",
      "156": "However, there is nothing to suggest that Jabing and Galing could possibly have agreed to change their evidence to help exculpate each other. Indeed, the highly inconsistent versions of fact given by Jabing and Galing, parts of which are detrimental to the other, would suggest that they have not colluded in any way.",
      "157": "Dr Teo\u2019s evidence on the likely causes of the injuries, understood in light of the fact that Jabing had attacked the deceased first, would suggest that the belt buckle might have caused some of the fractures. This possibility creates a reasonable doubt on whether Jabing might have actually caused most of the fractures sustained by the deceased on the head (either by multiple strikes or two strikes of huge force).",
      "158": "During the trial, Dr Teo was reluctant to link any particular injury to the weapons used in this case. In relation to the wood, Dr Teo said that:",
      "159": "When Dr Teo was asked if any of the injuries or abrasions on the deceased\u2019s body can be identified as being caused by the belt buckle, he pointed out, among others, the two abrasions on the right eyebrow of the deceased would appear to match the design of the belt buckle. Nonetheless, this has to be taken in light of the fact that Dr Teo had repeated over eight times that he would caution against over-interpreting these injuries. Dr Teo explained that this is because \u201cana sarca\u201d (swelling caused by retained fluid) and the healing process over the six days might have distorted or change the shape and pattern of the injuries. Furthermore, he acknowledged the possibility that the patterned injuries might be a matter of \u201ccoincidence\u201d. In fact, Dr Teo acknowledged that he is \u201creally speculating\u201d on whether the belt is the cause of the injuries over the right eyebrow/eyelid.",
      "160": "As between the belt buckle and the wood, Dr Teo took the view that the wood was more likely to cause the fractures, but did not rule out the belt buckle as a cause, especially if the skull was already fractured:",
      "161": "Significantly, there is some evidence to suggest that Galing started hitting the deceased only after Jabing had hit the deceased. While this suggests that the skull must have been fractured before Galing attacked the deceased, there is very little evidence to show the extent of damage that had been caused by Jabing. Furthermore, there is no clear evidence on the number of times and the manner in which Galing attacked the deceased (except the possible link to the fracture over the right eyebrow). There is no reason to assume that Galing could only attack the deceased with the belt buckle; he could, for instance, have slammed the deceased\u2019s head against the floor or kicked/stepped on the deceased\u2019s head. I should also highlight that Galing had admitted that he was the last person to have attacked the deceased, not Jabing.",
      "162": "In my opinion, Dr Teo\u2019s evidence, taken at its highest, would suggest that Jabing had hit the deceased in the head first and caused the deceased\u2019s skull to fracture. He does not say how much damage was attributable to Jabing and Galing respectively. As mentioned earlier ([122] above), the medical evidence also does not rule out the possibility of a fall causing some of the fractures.",
      "163": "In my view, therefore, there is insufficient evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had inflicted more than two strikes to the deceased\u2019s head. Besides the uncertainty as to the number of blows sustained by the deceased ([124] above), there is also no clear evidence, factual or medical, to support the finding that Jabing had hit the deceased on the head at least three times or with such huge force as to cause most of the fractures. The factual evidence (ie, Jabing, Galing and Wu Jun) would, at best, suggest that there were two strikes or more, and the medical evidence would only support a finding that Jabing had hit the deceased first, and caused fractures in the skull (the extent of which is unknown).",
      "164": "Accordingly, the evidence would suggest that Jabing\u2019s involvement is, with respect, less extensive than the finding in the Majority Judgement at [67]\u2013[70]. For convenience, the attribution is reflected in the table below:",
      "165": "As discussed earlier, the medical evidence is unable to show the extent to which the injuries were caused by Jabing as opposed to Galing. It would only show that Jabing had hit the deceased first and caused the skull to fracture (to an unknown extent). However, the evidence of Jabing and Galing on the sequence of events (as opposed to the number of strikes) might shed some light on the severity of the injuries inflicted by Jabing and Galing respectively.",
      "166": "The evidence suggests that the deceased had not fallen on his face after being first struck by Jabing, and might have been able to stand up after that. This casts a doubt on whether Jabing had, in fact, struck the deceased multiple times in the head or with such huge force that would have caused most of the skull fractures.",
      "167": "Jabing testified during the trial that after he hit the deceased on the head for the first time, the deceased \u201cfell to the ground\u201d, and the deceased\u2019s face hit the ground first. Jabing claimed that the deceased \u201cturned his body around to face upwards\u201d with his hands covering his head and Jabing then hit the deceased \u201cone more time\u201d. When asked to elaborate, Jabing\u2019s evidence was that he \u201ccannot remember\u201d what the deceased was doing before his second blow and \u201cdo not know\u201d if the deceased was bleeding from the head.",
      "168": "It should also be noted that Jabing gave a slightly different account in his statements:\n(a)     Statement dated 26 February 2008:\n(b)     Statement dated 4 March 2008:",
      "169": "This casts doubts on whether the deceased had actually fallen on his face after being struck by Jabing the first time.",
      "170": "Galing testified during the trial that he had only saw Jabing hit the deceased once, and it occurred at the start when they first approached the deceased and Wu Jun. Galing also testified during trial that the deceased did not fall face down after Jabing\u2019s initial strike; instead, he repeated at least three times that he saw the deceased \u201cmoving forward\u201d or \u201crunning forward\u201d after being struck. This was largely consistent with his evidence in the statements, where he said that the deceased \u201cran forward\u201d after being hit. Galing\u2019s evidence on this point would suggest, to some extent, that Jabing\u2019s initial strike that was witnessed by Galing may not have been with such huge force.",
      "171": "After Jabing\u2019s first strike, Galing said he went after Wu Jun but as he could not catch up with Wu Jun, he decided to turn back. Galing testified that he saw the deceased holding onto his head while Jabing was walking towards Galing (to chase after Wu Jun who was allegedly coming after Galing from behind). Galing\u2019s evidence during the trial was that he saw the deceased standing up or stood up and was going to attack him:\n(a)     27 July 2009, p 12, line 19:\n(b)     27 July 2009, p 16, line 8:\n(c)     28 July 2009, p 27, line 24:",
      "172": "Again, this would suggest, to some extent, that Jabing might not have struck the deceased multiple times or that Jabing\u2019s strikes (whether witnessed by Galing or not) may not have been with such huge force.",
      "173": "However, some caution must be exercised when approaching Galing\u2019s evidence on this point. First, Galing\u2019s evidence was slightly inconsistent on whether the deceased actually managed to stand up or was just trying to stand up (contrast [159(a)] and [159(b)]\u2013[159(c)] above). When asked to elaborate, Galing clarified that the deceased was able to stand up but he \u201cwas not able to say whether he was standing steadily or not\u201d even though they were only about 3.8 metres apart. He also could not explain what the deceased did which led him to think that the deceased wanted to attack him. Second, one might argue that Galing was trying to reduce his culpability by asserting that the deceased was trying to attack him (such that it appears he acted in retaliation when he hit the deceased). Nevertheless, it is doubtful if this argument carries much weight as Galing could well have denied hitting the deceased in the first place if he actually wanted to exculpate himself.",
      "174": "The medical evidence is more consistent with Galing\u2019s version, that is, the deceased did not fall forward and hit his head, and might have been able to stand up even after Jabing\u2019s attack.",
      "175": "There is evidence to suggest that the deceased did not fall face down after the first strike. First, as highlighted earlier at [101], Dr Teo and Dr Ho do not rule out the possibility that the fracture at the back of the head might not have been due to a direct blow. Second, and more importantly, Dr Teo took the view that fracture (1) at the forehead region, a comminuted fracture, was unlikely to have been caused by a simple fall. Further, Dr Teo also rejected the suggestion that the laceration and abrasion on the face might have been due to the deceased falling face down. When taken together, it would suggest that the deceased did not fall forward with his face first after being struck by Jabing.",
      "176": "While some blood was found on the kerb near where the deceased was lying, there is no evidence indicating that the deceased had actually hit his forehead on the kerb when Jabing first hit the deceased on the head. Dr Teo\u2019s evidence on this point is pertinent:",
      "177": "It should also be noted that Jabing\u2019s evidence at trial was that he is \u201cnot sure whether [the deceased\u2019s] head hit the kerb\u201d.",
      "178": "For completeness, it should be added that there was no clear explanation for the blood on the kerb. Wu Jun\u2019s evidence was that he found the deceased on the grass patch and not the kerb. The paramedic who first responded also said that the deceased was lying in a supine position with his head on the grass patch and not the kerb. Nonetheless, it does not mean that the deceased must have hit his forehead on the kerb upon Jabing\u2019s first strike simply because there is no alternative explanation based on the available evidence.",
      "179": "Further, Dr Ho\u2019s evidence was that a person who suffered a severe blow to the head may not succumb immediately:",
      "180": "To some extent, Dr Ho\u2019s evidence is consistent with Galing\u2019s version that the deceased did not fall after Jabing\u2019s initial strike, and might have been able to stand up even after Jabing\u2019s attack.",
      "181": "Jabing and Galing gave contradicting accounts of what transpired immediately after the deceased was first hit by Jabing. The medical evidence is more consistent with Galing\u2019s account that the deceased did not fall immediately after being struck by Jabing. It is also consistent with Galing\u2019s evidence that the deceased might have been able to stand after Jabing\u2019s attack.",
      "182": "In my opinion, the fact that the deceased did not fall face first after Jabing\u2019s initial strike, and might have been able to stand up even after Jabing\u2019s attack would cast a reasonable doubt on whether Jabing struck the deceased multiple times on his head and, more importantly, the force he had used. One might argue that the court must be cautious when assessing the weight that should be placed on the fact that the deceased was able to stand up shortly after he was attacked by Jabing, as it may not necessarily be an accurate indicator of the severity of the injuries caused by Jabing. However, it must be noted that Dr Teo\u2019s evidence on this point ([167] above) must be considered in the proper context, that is, Dr Teo was asked a hypothetical question (whether a person would succumb immediately to a huge force to the head) to which he answered that there is a possibility. He was not asked to comment specifically on the likelihood in the present case. Moreover, Dr Teo only said that there was a possibility that a person struck by a huge force at the head might not succumb immediately but \u201cnot all cases\u201d.",
      "183": "Taking into account the evidence, and bearing in mind the discussions on the two key findings and the ancillary point above, in my judgment, the findings of fact that can be established beyond reasonable doubt are as follows:\n(a)     Jabing followed the deceased and Wu Jun with the intention of robbing them;\n(b)     Jabing picked up a piece of wood when he was approaching the deceased and Wu Jun;\n(c)     Jabing and Galing approached the deceased and Wu Jun from behind, and Jabing struck the deceased in the head without warning;\n(d)     at around the same time, Galing struck Wu Jun from behind; Wu Jun ran and Galing gave chase;\n(e)     after the initial blow by Jabing, the deceased did not fall and hit his forehead but moved forward;\n(f)     Jabing hit the deceased again in the head at least once, and the deceased\u2019s skull was fractured;\n(g)     Galing did not manage to catch Wu Jun, so he turned back and walked towards the deceased; Jabing walked pass Galing and headed towards the overhead bridge;\n(h)     Galing found the deceased in a sitting position, trying to stand up and he hit the deceased once or more; and\n(i)     Galing took the deceased\u2019s handphone.",
      "184": "While the key findings of fact have been discussed above, it would be crucial to consider, as much as possible, the sequence of events in its totality so as to fully appreciate the nature of the attack on the deceased.",
      "185": "The evidential basis for each factual finding will be examined in greater detail below.",
      "186": "This finding of fact is uncontroversial. Jabing maintained consistently in his statements and during the trial that he had followed the deceased and Wu Jun with the intention of robbing them.",
      "187": "It was recorded in Jabing\u2019s statements that:\n(a)     Statement dated 27 February 2008:\n(b)     Statement dated 26 February 2008:\n(c)     Statement dated 4 March 2008:",
      "188": "The same was repeated by Jabing during the trial:",
      "189": "This was corroborated by Galing\u2019s evidence at trial:",
      "190": "Jabing and Galing disagree on who initiated the plan to rob the deceased and Wu Jun. However, they both agree that Jabing approached the deceased and Wu Jun with the intention to rob them.",
      "191": "This finding of fact is also uncontroversial. Jabing\u2019s evidence was that he picked up the wood as they were approaching the deceased and Wu Jun:\n(a)     30 July 2009, p 39, line 21:\n(b)     30 July 2009, p 58, line 30:\n(c)     31 July 2009, p 22, line 1:",
      "192": "Jabing\u2019s evidence at trial on this point is consistent with his evidence in the statements.",
      "193": "Jabing\u2019s evidence on this point is also corroborated by Galing\u2019s evidence:\n(a)     24 July 2009, p 28, line 2:\n(b)     27 July 2009, p 11, line 4:",
      "194": "Galing\u2019s evidence during the trial was consistent with his statements.",
      "195": "There was nothing to suggest that Jabing and Galing were not telling the truth in this respect.",
      "196": "This point has been addressed above at [91]\u2013[103].",
      "197": "The evidence indicates that Galing struck Wu Jun at around the same time when Jabing struck the deceased, and Galing gave chase when Wu Jun tried to flee:\n(a)     Galing\u2019s evidence was that he struck Wu Jun because Wu Jun (who saw Jabing hit the deceased) was going to hit Jabing;\n(b)     Jabing\u2019s evidence at trial was that he did not see Galing hit Wu Jun, but he saw Galing chasing after Wu Jun after he hit the deceased on the head twice; and\n(c)     Wu Jun\u2019s evidence was that the deceased was groaning in pain very shortly after he was struck by Galing.",
      "198": "From the evidence above, especially taking into account the evidence of Wu Jun, it can be said that Galing struck Wu Jun at around the same time when Jabing struck the deceased.",
      "199": "This point has been addressed above at [153]\u2013[170].",
      "200": "This point has been addressed above at [104]\u2013[152].",
      "201": "As mentioned earlier (at [185]), the evidence suggests that Galing chased after Wu Jun. Galing\u2019s evidence was that he gave up chasing Wu Jun, started walking back towards the deceased and saw Jabing walking in the opposite direction:\n(a)     24 July 2009, p 30, line 28:\n(b)     27 July 2009, p 12, line 25:\n(c)     27 July 2009, p 35, line 3:\n(d)     28 July 2009, p 24, line 16:",
      "202": "This is corroborated by Jabing\u2019s evidence at trial:\n(a)     30 July 2009, p 66, line 31:\n(b)     31 July 2009, p 9, line 3:",
      "203": "There is, however, some doubt on how far Galing actually went to chase after Wu Jun before turning back. Galing said that he \u201cchased him until the side of the road\u201d (ie, Sims Way), but could not give an estimate of the distance. Earlier, Galing said it was somewhere between the electric substation and Sims Way. Wu Jun\u2019s evidence was that Galing appeared to have the intention of chasing him but he does not know if Galing did as he \u201cdid not turn around to look\u201d.",
      "204": "There is also some uncertainty as to why Jabing left the deceased and started walking towards the overhead bridge. Jabing never explained in his statements. Neither was Jabing questioned on this during the trial. Galing said that it was because Wu Jun was coming back for him and Jabing wanted to chase him away. However, Wu Jun said he went back only after he saw that \u201cthere was nobody around\u201d, and Jabing denied seeing Wu Jun coming back.",
      "205": "On the evidence available, it can only be concluded beyond reasonable doubt that Galing tried to chase after Wu Jun, turned back and walked pass Jabing who was going towards the overhead bridge.",
      "206": "This point has been addressed above at [159]\u2013[170].",
      "207": "It is undisputed that Galing was the one who took the deceased\u2019s handphone. Galing admitted that he took the deceased\u2019s handphone after hitting him, and Jabing said he was told by a friend that Galing had taken a handphone.",
      "208": "There is some doubt as to whether Galing took the deceased\u2019s handphone from the floor next to the deceased, or from his waist pouch. During the trial, Galing contested the accuracy of his statements (in which he stated that he took the handphone from the waist pouch). Like the earlier instance involving the number of strikes he saw Jabing hit the deceased, Galing explained that he was influenced by the officer\u2019s suggestion when the statements were recorded. There is no corroborating evidence apart from Wu Jun\u2019s statement which stated that the deceased would usually put his handphone in his waist pouch. It appears that Wu Jun did not say specifically that the deceased kept his handphone in his waist pouch on the day of the incident. In fact, no waist pouch was ever recovered (either from the scene or Galing\u2019s possession), and the waist pouch (if it existed) did not form part of the exhibits. The evidence of the IO, SSI Zainal Abidin Ismail, was that he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of the waistpouch and had only requested to seize the deceased\u2019s clothes.",
      "209": "As such, the limited evidence available would only support a finding that Galing took the deceased\u2019s handphone.",
      "210": "The two key findings that would point towards the conclusion that Jabing had acted in blatant disregard for human life are: first, Jabing approached the deceased from behind and hit him on the head, and second, Jabing hit the deceased repeatedly or with such force as to cause most of the fractures.",
      "211": "As discussed above, there is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had caused most of the fractures (either by multiple strikes or by two strikes with huge force). The evidence available would, at best, prove beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had hit the deceased twice and with such force as to cause the skull to fracture. The question is whether this set of facts cross the threshold of the test established at [45] of the Majority Judgment, ie, whether Jabing had \u201cacted in a way which exhibits such viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life\u201d.",
      "212": "The Majority Judgment had concluded that the threshold was crossed based on a finding that Jabing had inflicted at least three or more blows causing extensive fractures to the deceased\u2019s skull. I have attempted to demonstrate that a proper analysis of the evidence discloses reasonable doubt on the validity of that finding and that the evidence could only prove beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had struck the deceased on the head twice. There is also doubt as to whether those two blows were the cause of most of the extensive injuries found in the skull, as opposed to causing it to fracture and resulting in death.",
      "213": "Based on the evidence that I have shown to be proven beyond reasonable doubt, I am of the view that the threshold is not crossed. Jabing, along with Galing, had intended to rob the deceased and his companion, Wu Jun. Jabing had approached the deceased from behind and struck him with two wicked blows to the head with the intention, at the very minimum, to incapacitate him. But he had stopped after that. It was not a case in which he had repeatedly hit the deceased after he was down, which would justify the conclusion that he had acted with viciousness and blatant disregard for human life. I must therefore, with the greatest of respect, disagree with the decision of the majority of this court to allow the appeal of the Public Prosecutor.",
      "214": "I have had the benefit of reading the judgments of my learned colleagues Chao Hick Tin JA, Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA and Chan Seng Onn J (\u201cthe Majority Judgment\u201d) and of Lee Seiu Kin J. I adopt the nomenclature in the Majority Judgment but I will refer to the Respondent as \u201cJabing\u201d.",
      "215": "I agree with the principles set out in [44] and [45] of the Majority Judgment as to when it would be appropriate to impose the death penalty for an offence of murder where the conviction is made under s 300(c) of the PC.",
      "216": "However, like Lee J, I will respectfully depart from the Majority Judgment on the imposition of the capital punishment. I also agree with Lee J that this court is entitled to revisit any findings of fact made in the CA (Conviction) Decision ([2] supra) in view of the difference in the nature of the inquiry then and now.",
      "217": "The evidence is clear that Jabing attacked the deceased from behind without warning. However, it is less clear how many times Jabing hit the deceased with a piece of wood.",
      "218": "In so far as the factual non-medical evidence is concerned, the most damaging of such evidence against Jabing was the cautioned statement given by Galing dated 26 February 2008 where he said that, \u201cJabing was too violent when hitting the Chinese man until he bled profusely. I saw him hitting the Chinese man several times and his head cracked open\u201d. Galing\u2019s cautioned statement was vivid.",
      "219": "I agree that Galing\u2019s cautioned statement had been correctly recorded as was an investigation statement of his in which he said that, \u201c... I gave up the chase and turned back towards Jabing who was hitting the other Chinese with the wood in his hands repeatedly ...\u201d.",
      "220": "On the other hand, it must be remembered that Galing did not repeat the allegation of repeated blows by Jabing with violence when he gave oral testimony at trial. On the contrary, he said Jabing hit the deceased once. It was Jabing himself who said at trial that he hit the deceased twice. In my view, it is unsafe to place too much weight on Galing\u2019s statements which he did not repeat at trial. While these statements might have been accurately recorded and his oral testimony might have been an attempt to help Jabing, the statements might also have been embellishments by Galing if he was initially trying to push the blame for the deceased\u2019s death onto Jabing. I cannot rule out the latter.",
      "221": "I come now to the medical evidence. Lee J noted (see [110] above) that the forensic pathologist, Dr Teo Eng Swee, had identified eight points of impact which resulted in many fractures. The Majority Judgment said Dr Teo had identified at least five separate groups of fractures which he felt were due to separate impacts. I note that what Dr Teo had said was that the injuries \u201cmight be\u201d due to separate impacts. Furthermore, as Lee J noted, Dr Teo had also testified that:",
      "222": "Dr Teo also said:",
      "223": "There was also evidence that Galing himself had hit the deceased with a belt buckle although it is not clear whether he did so only once. As for the use of the belt buckle, Dr Teo said that:",
      "224": "He elaborated that:",
      "225": "As regards the question whether a fall could be the cause of the fractures, he did not think so. However, for one of the fractures, ie, fracture (14), he said this might be due to an impact but he was not able to rule out that it was due to a fall.",
      "226": "Therefore, Dr Teo\u2019s evidence was that there would be at least one hard blow with severe force which fractured the skull. It was likely that that blow was caused by a piece of wood and not the belt buckle. However, once the skull was fractured (whether by one or two or more blows), it was not clear what caused the other fractures. In particular, it was not clear whether the other fractures were caused by Jabing using the piece of wood or Galing using the belt buckle or a combination of the two and perhaps also a fall as well. Furthermore, Dr Teo could not say that there were definitely five separate blows to the deceased\u2019s head. I should mention for clarification that Dr Teo had also explained that the fractures of the deceased\u2019s head were not in themselves the fatal injury. The fatal injury was injury to the brain.",
      "227": "In my view, the medical evidence does not necessarily corroborate any suggestion that Jabing inflicted more than two blows to the deceased\u2019s head although I agree that Jabing was responsible for fracturing the skull. Therefore, it is unclear just how many blows Jabing had inflicted on the deceased\u2019s head.",
      "228": "For the reasons stated in Lee J\u2019s Judgment, I am of the view that there is also a reasonable doubt whether Jabing\u2019s blows were all inflicted when the deceased was lying on the ground.",
      "229": "In the circumstances, and even though Jabing\u2019s blows would have been of considerable force, it is in my view unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted in a way which exhibited a blatant disregard for human life. I would therefore dismiss the Prosecution\u2019s appeal for capital punishment for Jabing."

      "2": "At the conclusion of the trial, I convicted the accused and sentenced him to a term of life imprisonment which was ordered to commence from 29 May 2012, the date he was first placed on remand. He has filed an appeal against the sentence imposed, and I provide my detailed reasons.",
      "3": "In support of their case, the Prosecution led three strands of evidence. The first concerned the circumstances leading to the discovery of the body. The second concerned the statements made by the accused. The third pertained to the scientific and medical evidence, including evidence that at the material time, the accused was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. I will set out each in turn.",
      "4": "The deceased, Mallika Jesudasan, was the mother of the accused. She was last seen alive at home in their flat (\u201cthe flat\u201d) by her daughter, Sheena Sutherson (\u201cSheena\u201d), before Sheena left the flat to meet a friend at about 6.30pm on 27 May 2012. At about 10.35pm, Sunil Sutherson (\u201cSunil\u201d), the deceased\u2019s second son, returned home to find that the door had been latched from the inside. He used his mobile phone to call the house phone. When the accused answered the call, Sunil asked him to unlock the door. The accused replied that he would do so after he had cleaned the house. Sunil thought this strange as the accused never did any house-cleaning. After a few minutes, the accused unlocked the door.",
      "5": "When Sunil entered the flat, the accused retreated to the bedroom which he shared with Sunil and locked the door. Sunil could not find the deceased at home. When he called her mobile phone, it was switched off. Then, Sunil called Sheena to inform her of the situation and asked her to rush home. Sheena returned home several minutes later. When Sunil and Sheena searched the home, they noticed that several things were amiss. First, a bottle of vodka, a stainless steel knife and a stove lighter were placed on the table in the kitchen when they were not normally stored there. Second, they noticed that there were scraps of burnt paper and fabric in the room shared by Sheena and the deceased. Lastly, they noticed that the floor was very sticky and it seemed like many pieces of furniture had been moved from their original positions.",
      "6": "A while later, Daniel Jesudason (\u201cDaniel\u201d), the deceased\u2019s brother, arrived. He had made his way to the flat after learning that the deceased was missing. Sunil and Sheena informed him of their observations. As they were unable to find the deceased, Daniel, Sunil and Sheena left the flat and walked around the neighbourhood to continue the search but the search proved futile. About ten minutes later, they returned to the flat.",
      "7": "By then, the items on the kitchen table were no longer there and the burnt material on the floor had been cleaned up. Sunil walked into the bedroom he shared with the accused. He noticed that several boxes which were usually stored underneath the accused\u2019s bed were out of place. He asked Daniel to take a closer look. As Daniel was about to pull a suitcase from underneath the accused\u2019s bed, the accused rushed in and attempted to stop him. Daniel persisted in pulling the suitcase out, and he saw a pair of legs.",
      "8": "Daniel cried out in shock and informed Sunil and Sheena that the deceased was under the bed. He then shouted for Sunil to call the police. The accused rushed out of his bedroom and latched the main door of the flat. He then confronted Sunil and demanded that he not call the police. Seeing this, Daniel grabbed hold of the accused in an attempt to stop him from getting close to Sunil and a scuffle ensued.",
      "9": "Meanwhile, Sunil managed to get through to the emergency operator and shouted his address before putting down his mobile phone in an attempt to placate the accused. The accused demanded that Sunil and Sheena hand their mobile phones to him, which they did. Around then, Daniel\u2019s wife called him on his mobile phone. Daniel answered, hurriedly informing her that the deceased had been killed and requesting her to call the police immediately. The accused then approached Daniel and demanded that he surrender his mobile phone. Seeing that the accused was occupied, Sunil took this opportunity to unlatch the main door and run out of the flat to get help. The accused tried to stop him but he was intercepted by Daniel. In the scuffle which followed, Daniel sustained a cut on his left eyebrow.",
      "10": "Soon after, the police arrived. One of the police officers, Senior Staff Sergeant Mohamed Jasmani bin Mohamed Hassan (\u201cSSSGT Jasmani\u201d), questioned the accused, who stated that he stabbed the deceased after a quarrel. Following this, SSSGT Jasmani entered the accused\u2019s room whereupon he noticed the deceased\u2019s leg protruding from beneath the bed. When he lifted the mattress slightly, he caught a glimpse of the deceased\u2019s body, which lay on the floor wrapped in a blood-soaked blanket. Soon after, Senior Station Inspector Riduan bin Hamid (\u201cSSI Riduan\u201d) arrived at the flat. Together, they questioned the accused. The accused was initially reticent but eventually informed them that he stabbed the deceased after an altercation. Upon hearing this, they placed the accused under arrest.",
      "11": "Next, I go to the statements given by the accused to the police. Apart from the oral statements made immediately prior to his arrest to SSSGT Jasmani and SSI Riduan set out at [10] above, there were five written statements recorded under the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of 2010) (\u201cCPC\u201d). In chronological order, they were:\n(a)     A statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC on 28 May 2012 from 4.25am to 5.05am by Deputy Superintendent Foo Jit Choon.\n(b)     A statement recorded under s 23 of the CPC on 28 May 2012 from 12.15pm to 2.00pm (\u201cthe cautioned statement\u201d). On this occasion, the accused elected to write down his account of the events himself. He did so in the presence of ASP Tan Lee Chye Raymond after being administered the statutory warning.\n(c)     A statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC on 30 May 2012 from 10.10am to 12.25pm (\u201cthe second long statement\u201d) by the investigation officer, ASP Tan Lian Heng (\u201cIO Tan\u201d).\n(d)     A statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC on 30 May 2012 from 4.50pm to 6.40pm (\u201cthe third long statement\u201d) by IO Tan.\n(e)     A statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC on 31 May 2012 from 10.35am to 12.27pm (\u201cthe fourth long statement\u201d) by IO Tan.",
      "12": "The accused did not challenge the admissibility of the five written statements, and they were duly admitted into evidence. The fourth long statement only related to details of the accused\u2019s personal background so I shall say no more of it. As for the other four statements, the contents were largely consistent, albeit with minor discrepancies as to the precise sequence of events and the length of time that transpired between them. In essence, the accused narrated that he quarrelled with the deceased and that, in the course of the altercation, he stabbed the deceased in the neck with knives.",
      "13": "The cautioned statement and the second long statement provided the most detailed accounts of the events. In them, the accused described that the deceased had given him some money to purchase food for the two of them. After returning home with the food, he changed out before sitting down to consume his food in the living room while the deceased consumed her food in her bedroom. After that, the deceased came out of her bedroom and asked the accused if he had any money for her. He answered in the negative and proceeded to the kitchen to wash his plate. The deceased stood at the door of the kitchen and continued to ask the accused for money. The deceased then turned inexplicably violent. She lunged at him, pulled his hair, scratched his face and tried to pull his shorts off.",
      "14": "The accused reacted by picking up a knife with a blue handle from the kitchen counter and stabbed the accused in the neck, leaving the knife embedded in the side of the deceased\u2019s neck. The deceased staggered back towards her bedroom and tried to reach for the phone. The accused returned to the kitchen to retrieve a second knife (\u201ca knife with a black handle\u201d, as the accused recounted in the second long statement) which he used to stab the deceased in her throat, causing her to collapse. The accused explained in the third long statement he stabbed her for a second time to \u201cprevent her from calling someone\u201d. After this, the deceased\u2019s eyes changed. She writhed on the floor for some time and spoke in an incomprehensible language. The accused stared at her body before retrieving a third knife (a \u201csilver butterfly knife\u201d) and slit her throat. In the third long statement, he explained that he did so to ensure that he would not get \u201cattacked again\u201d. Once again, the accused stared at her body for a period of time before deciding to dispose of the body.",
      "15": "The accused wrapped the deceased in bed sheets and blankets, covered her with some old newspapers and doused her in alcohol (from the vodka bottle and a bottle of rice wine) before attempting to set her alight with a stove lighter. However, he only managed to singe parts of the deceased\u2019s clothing before the fire died out. The accused then took steps to hide the body. He wrapped the deceased up in more bed sheets and blankets before dragging her from her bedroom to his own where he placed her underneath his bed, rearranging some of the items beneath the bed in order to hide the body from view. He then mopped the floor in an attempt to remove all traces of blood from the flat. While he was in the midst of cleaning, Sunil returned home whereupon the body was found.",
      "16": "The final strand of evidence adduced pertained to the results of DNA analyses, the autopsy performed on the deceased\u2019s body and the psychiatric reports concerning the accused\u2019s mental state.",
      "17": "In the course of investigations, a large number of exhibits and swabs were taken from the flat, and sent by the police to the Health Sciences Authority (\u201cHSA\u201d) for DNA analysis. Further, the police also collected samples from certain persons, including the accused, for analysis by HSA so as to generate their DNA profiles. If any of the DNA profiles obtained from the exhibits or swabs were to match a DNA profile of one of the persons, then an inference could be drawn that the person had handled the exhibit in question or was present at the scene.",
      "18": "In this regard, an issue arose regarding the admissibility of a report prepared by one Ms Tang Wai Man, formerly an analyst in the employ of HSA, who had returned to reside in Hong Kong and was not present for the trial. Ms Tang\u2019s report detailed the DNA profile of the accused based on her analysis of a blood sample collected from him. Should the Prosecution intend to rely on the DNA evidence to establish that the accused was present at the scene of the crime and or that he had handled certain exhibits, the report would be important. As Ms Tang was not available as a witness, the report was hearsay evidence and therefore inadmissible.",
      "19": "On the second day of the trial, 7 July 2015, the Prosecution indicated that they would be applying to admit the report under s 32(1)(j)(iii) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cEA\u201d): viz, that it was a statement of relevant facts made by a person outside Singapore whose attendance it would not be practicable to secure. On the same day, they served a written notice to admit documentary hearsay evidence on the accused as required under s 32(4)(a) of the EA read with reg 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Notice Requirements to Admit Hearsay Evidence) Regulations 2012. While the accused did not clearly object to the admission of the report, he indicated that he would prefer Ms Tang to be present. On 9 July 2015, the Prosecution made an oral application pursuant to s 279 of the CPC for an ancillary hearing to be conducted for the court to determine the admissibility of the report.",
      "20": "At the ancillary hearing, IO Tan testified as follows:\n(a)     Ms Tang was present at the Committal Hearing on 11 May 2015. At the conclusion of her testimony, she was served a bond to secure her attendance and told of the trial dates. At that time, she was still employed by HSA and did not give any indication that she would be resigning from her position.\n(b)     Subsequently, Ms Tang resigned from HSA, and her last day of service was 14 June 2015. According to the immigration records obtained from the Immigration Checkpoint Authority of Singapore, she left Singapore on 18 June 2015 and, as at 9 July 2015, she had not returned to Singapore.\n(c)     A few days before the trial commenced on 6 July 2015, IO Tan sent a reminder to Ms Tang to her e-mail address with HSA but received no reply. On the first day of the trial, IO Tan tried to contact Ms Tang on the telephone to request for her attendance in court on 7 July 2015 instead of 9 July 2015 as originally scheduled. He failed to reach her and soon discovered that she had left Singapore.\n(d)     Through HSA, IO Tan found out Ms Tang\u2019s contact details in Hong Kong and managed to speak with Ms Tang over the telephone on 8 July 2015. She informed him that she would not be returning to Singapore in the near future. Citing personal reasons, she also refused to return to Singapore to testify on behalf of the Prosecution even though IO Tan informed her that her travel expenses would be paid for and that she would be given a subsistence allowance. IO Tan later followed up on the telephone conversation with an e-mail reducing the salient points of the discussion in writing and asking Ms Tang if she would confirm that she did not wish to return to Singapore. Ms Tang replied in the affirmative.",
      "21": "In Gimpex Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd [2015] 2 SLR 686 (\u201cGimpex\u201d), the Court of Appeal dealt with the admission of hearsay evidence under s 32(1)(j) of the EA. At [98], the Court of Appeal explained that s 32(1)(j)(iii) sets out two requirements: (a) the witness must be outside of Singapore; and (b) it is not practicable to secure his or her attendance. Based on the evidence of IO Tan, it was clear to me that the former had been satisfied. As for the latter, the Court of Appeal said at [99]:",
      "22": "On the facts, it seemed to me that it was not practicable to secure Ms Tang\u2019s attendance. At the close of the committal hearing (which took place only two months before the trial), she had been instructed to be available for the trial. After IO Tan discovered the fact of Ms Tang\u2019s departure from Singapore, he acted with considerable expedition and took reasonable steps to secure her attendance. He managed to get in touch with Ms Tang and requested her return to Singapore to testify. He informed her that the cost of her return would be borne by the State and that she would be given a subsistence allowance for the duration of her stay. Despite these efforts, Ms Tang made it clear that she had no interest in returning to Singapore, communicating this first over the telephone and then in writing (see [20(d)] above). In my view, the requirements of s 32(1)(j) of the EA had been satisfied. Prima facie, the report was admissible.",
      "23": "However, as the Court of Appeal clarified at [103] of Gimpex, the fact that a document is admissible under s 32(1) is not the end of the matter. The court still has a residual discretion under s 32(3) to exclude hearsay evidence in the interests of justice even in the absence of an objection from the other party. In applying s 32(3), the issue is whether admissible evidence should be excluded because other countervailing factors outweigh the benefit of having the evidence admitted (see Gimpex at [105]). However, the Court of Appeal opined that courts should not normally exercise their discretion to exclude evidence that is admissible under the EA (see Gimpex at [109]).",
      "24": "There was no doubt that Ms Tang\u2019s report would be an important piece of evidence (see [17] and [18] above). When asked about his position regarding the report, the accused did not allege any impropriety in the testing process or in the process of the preparation of the report. He informed me that he only wished to have the report \u201cexplained\u201d, by which he meant that he wanted general information on how the report ought to be read. To that end, the Prosecution had arranged for another HSA analyst, Ms Joyce Low Hui Koon (\u201cMs Low\u201d), to testify as to the DNA profiling procedure adopted by HSA and to explain how such reports are to be read. Given that the reliability of the report was not in issue, and the fact that the accused\u2019s concerns would be adequately addressed by having Ms Low testify, I was satisfied that the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial would be preserved and did not see any reason to exercise the discretion under s 32(3) to refuse the admission of Ms Tang\u2019s report. I should add that during cross-examination, the accused only asked Ms Low general questions about the interpretation of the report and did not allege that there had been any impropriety in Ms Tang\u2019s analysis.",
      "25": "Among the exhibits retrieved from the flat and sent to HSA for analysis, there were the stove lighter, vodka bottle and the three knives as described earlier. The following is a brief summary of the results of the analyses conducted on the most notable exhibits:",
      "26": "Bloodstains were detected at various parts of the flat. Swabs were taken of these bloodstains. Traces of the accused\u2019s DNA were found in bloodstains detected in the kitchen, the common corridor just outside the bedrooms and the living room.",
      "27": "Dr George Paul, a Senior Consultant Forensic Pathologist with the Forensic Medicine Division of HSA, examined the body of the deceased and prepared a detailed report in which he drew attention to three distinct injuries (numbered \u201c14\u201d, \u201c15\u201d and \u201c16\u201d respectively). I will provide brief descriptions of each:\n(a)     Injury 14 was described as an \u201cincised stab wound present on the outer front of right side neck\u201d. The wound was assessed as having a lateral (\u201cright to left\u201d) depth of 17.6cm and was, in all likelihood, caused by a \u201csingle edged somewhat thin bladed weapon or a double edged weapon with one edge not so sharp\u201d. Under cross-examination, Dr Paul testified that this injury could have been caused by P234 which was seized from the flat (see [25] above) and which the accused had referred to in his statement as the \u201cknife with the black handle\u201d (see [14] above).\n(b)     Injury 15 was described as an \u201c[i]ncised somewhat vertical wound ... in the upper outer part of right side of neck\u201d which ran from \u201cright to left, somewhat upwards and backwards\u201d and had a total lateral depth of 13cm. Under cross-examination, Dr Paul testified that this injury could have been caused by P236 which was seized from the flat (see [25] above) and which the accused had referred to in his statements as the \u201csilver butterfly knife\u201d (see [14] above).\n(c)     Injury 16 was described as a \u201cT\u201d shaped wound within which a kitchen knife with a blue handle (P235, the same knife which was observed by the police officers who attended at the scene and which was described by the accused in his statements as the \u201cknife with blue handle\u201d: see [25] and [14] above) was embedded. Dr Paul elaborated that the \u201cwound went from left to right\u201d and had a total depth of 13cm.",
      "28": "Dr Paul concluded that \u201c[d]eath in this case was not as a result of a natural disease process\u201d but was instead attributable to \u201chaemorrhage from multiple stab injuries to neck\u201d (viz, injuries 14 to16). He also opined that injuries 14 to 16 \u201cindividually and collectively were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary cause [sic] of nature\u201d.",
      "29": "The evidence on the accused\u2019s mental state came in the form of four psychiatric reports issued between 22 June 2012 and 22 October 2013, which were prepared by Dr Kenneth Koh, a senior consultant with the Department of General and Forensic Psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH\u201d) (\u201cDr Koh\u201d).",
      "30": "In his first psychiatric report dated 22 June 2012 (\u201cthe first psychiatric report\u201d), Dr Koh detailed the psychiatric history of the accused. The accused first presented with symptoms of mental illness in 2006. After he had waved knives at his uncle, he was taken to IMH by the police. Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, he was treated with antipsychotic medication. For 11 days in May 2006, he was warded in IMH. Initially, after his discharge, he attended his follow-up sessions. He started to default on them around October 2006. He returned to IMH in June 2007, when he was admitted by his family members, who reported that he had behaved in a hostile manner towards them. This time, he was warded for about a month. For the next three and a half years, he duly attended his outpatient follow-up appointments.",
      "31": "In February 2011, the deceased and Daniel reported that he had been exhibiting symptoms of a relapse. The accused refused to receive depot antipsychotic medication (ie, medication delivered by injection and specially prepared to release the antipsychotics in small amounts over a period of time, usually over a few weeks or a month) and insisted that he only be prescribed oral antipsychotics instead. He maintained this refusal in August 2011, when the deceased and Daniel informed IMH staff that his condition had deteriorated and that they suspected that he had not been taking his medication regularly. They opined that the accused\u2019s condition had been under better control while he was on depot medication. The accused refused the reinstatement of depot treatment but agreed to be prescribed a higher dose of oral medication. During a home visit conducted in November 2011, the deceased informed IMH staff that she doubted that the accused had been taking his medication regularly. However, the accused was assessed to have been well during the three outpatient visits (in January, March and May 2012) that immediately preceded the date of the present offence.",
      "32": "Dr Koh reported that the accused\u2019s family members informed him that the accused had not been well for several months and that his condition had been deteriorating at an accelerating pace in the period immediately preceding the offence. Sunil also informed Dr Koh that he suspected that the accused had only pretended to take his medication and that he threw it away when he thought nobody noticed. Sunil also said that the accused was capable of behaving normally when others came to visit but that he regressed to abnormal behaviour when he thought he was not being observed.",
      "33": "In conclusion, Dr Koh maintained the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and opined that, at the material time, the accused\u2019s \u201cthinking would have been significantly deranged from a normal state such that his judgement [sic], impulse control and planning abilities would have been severely compromised\u201d. He observed that the accused\u2019s case is somewhat unusual because he appeared to \u201cbe rather well at interviews, engaging in the conversation and being relevant in speech and organized in his accounts\u201d. Dr Koh explained that this was because the accused\u2019s intelligence \u201caids him in disguising his symptoms\u201d. However, his lucidity belied the fact that his condition had regressed significantly.",
      "34": "Dr Koh\u2019s prognosis was not favourable. He opined:",
      "35": "Dr Koh\u2019s second psychiatric report dated 24 July 2012 (\u201cthe second psychiatric report\u201d) and his third (\u201cthe third psychiatric report\u201d) dated 30 April 2013 are not comprehensive medical reports but more in the nature of clarificatory letters sent in response to queries that had been raised by IO Tan. In the second psychiatric report, Dr Koh opined that the accused \u201crequires long term medication and treatment\u201d coupled with \u201cclose supervision\u201d to ensure that he remains compliant with his treatment regimen. Without such treatment, the accused is \u201chighly likely to suffer from a relapse of his schizophrenia\u201d and that he \u201ccan be a danger to himself and others if he does not take his medication\u201d. Dr Koh clarified that, even with medication, there would still be a residual, albeit much reduced, chance of a relapse. Dr Koh concluded by saying that the \u201cbest treatment\u201d would be for the accused to receive a \u201cdepot antipsychotic and be in a facility where his consumption of oral antipsychotic medication can be enforced and observed\u201d.",
      "36": "The focus of the third psychiatric report was on the likelihood that the accused was a \u201cperson of unstable character\u201d who would be likely to reoffend and commit offences of like nature in the future. Dr Koh acknowledged that the accused was not a person with an established history of violence nor did he exhibit any psychopathic traits. However, the concern was that the accused suffered from a major mental illness but did not display any insight into his illness or his need for continuous treatment. This, when viewed in the light of the fact that the offence in question was \u201csudden, unexpected and extreme, [and committed] with little apparent warning\u201d warranted the conclusion that the accused be considered a \u201cdangerous and unpredictable individual\u201d.",
      "37": "In Dr Koh\u2019s last report dated 22 October 2013 (\u201cthe fourth psychiatric report\u201d), he noted that the accused had been consuming antipsychotic medication regularly for the past year and that his schizophrenia appeared to be in remission, though he continued to harbour some \u201cresidual and possibly fixed delusions surrounding the alleged murder\u201d. Dr Koh opined that the accused was \u201cfit to plead in Court\u201d.",
      "38": "At the close of the Prosecution\u2019s case, the accused submitted that there was no case to answer. He cast doubt on the accuracy of the evidence presented, arguing that the \u201cstatements made by the witnesses do not correspond to the evidence being presented in court\u201d. I did not accept his submission that there was no case to answer, and called on him to enter his defence. The accused elected to take the stand.",
      "39": "The accused did not say much during his evidence-in-chief save to intimate that the evidence had been fabricated. Under cross-examination, however, he gave a full account of the events which broadly resembled the version in his statements. The narrative began with him going downstairs to purchase food. After he returned, he consumed his dinner in the living room. At this point, the deceased \u201casked [him] about money\u201d and did not stop the questioning even after he entered the kitchen, continuing to ask him \u201cfor money and more money\u201d. After this, the deceased attempted to \u201coutrage his modesty\u201d and \u201charm\u201d him. She grabbed him by the hair, scratched his face, and tried to take off his T-shirt. The deceased also told him \u201cI want a son\u201d and tried to take his clothes off. The accused also alluded to an earlier incident when the deceased had stabbed him \u201cslightly in the stomach\u201d with a knife, but said that \u201cit was not a big incident\u201d.",
      "40": "After that, the accused attacked the deceased with three knives, elaborating that \u201c[o]ne was a black handle, one was a blue handle, the third knife was a silver butterfly knife\u201d as follows.\n(a)     The first stabbing took place in the kitchen immediately after the deceased allegedly grabbed him by the hair. The accused reached for a knife which was on the kitchen counter and stabbed the deceased in the neck. He said that he did not apprehend any threat to his life at the time but said that it was a \u201cspur of the moment thing\u201d. He accepted that when he stabbed her in the neck, he knew that, left untreated, the deceased would probably die from the injury.\n(b)     The deceased then staggered back towards the common area outside her bedroom. The accused then picked up a second knife. He returned to where the deceased was, \u201cwrestled with her for a while and ... stabbed her in the neck again\u201d. He accepted that at this point, he could not reasonably have apprehended any danger from her.\n(c)     Finally, he picked up a third knife and \u201ccut her throat from right to left\u201d. He explained that he did so because he \u201cneeded an end to her line of questioning about her---her relationship with me so it seemed like the right thing to do at that time\u201d.",
      "41": "He then explained that he \u201cswept all the debris away and ... mopped up the floor\u201d and that he had some difficulty trying to \u201cpush her under the bed\u201d. Shortly after, Sunil returned home.",
      "42": "The relevant provisions on culpable homicide within the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cPenal Code\u201d) read:",
      "43": "The Prosecution have particularised the charge against the accused in terms of an offence under s 299 (see the charge set out at [1]). More specifically, the Prosecution framed the charge under the second out of the three limbs of s 299 (see the italicised portion of s 299 at [42]). Therefore, in order to make out the charge as framed, the Prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused performed an act which caused the death of the deceased (\u201cthe actus reus\u201d), and that the accused performed the act with the intention of causing such bodily injury as was likely to cause death (\u201cthe mens rea\u201d).",
      "44": "The actus reus requirement is straightforward: the inquiry is whether the accused had performed an act which is causatively linked with the death of the deceased. What the mens rea requires is more complicated. In my view, the second limb of s 299 invites two separate inquiries. The first is a subjective inquiry whether the accused intended to inflict the particular injuries found on the deceased. The second is an objective inquiry whether the particular injuries were \u201clikely to cause death\u201d.",
      "45": "In Tham Kai Yau v PP [1977] 1 MLJ 174, the Federal Court of Criminal Appeal commented that the Malaysian Penal Code provisions relating to culpable homicide and murder (which are in pari materia with the Singapore provisions) are \u201cprobably the most tricky in the Code and are so technical as frequently to lead to confusion\u201d. The Federal Court explained that there are two situations in which culpable homicide may be made out: (a) where the elements of the offence of murder have been proved, but one or more exceptions contained in s 300 apply; or (b) where the necessary degree of mens rea in s 299 have been proved, but not the special degrees of mens rea in s 300 (see 176G\u2013176I).",
      "46": "It was similarly observed by the Indian Supreme Court in State of Andhra Pradesh v Rayavarapu Punnayya [1977] 1 SCR 601 (\u201cRayavarapu Punnayya\u201d) that \u201c[i]n the scheme of the Penal Code, \u2018culpable homicide\u2019 is genus and \u2018murder\u2019 its specie\u201d (at 606B). In other words, all instances of murder would also constitute culpable homicide, but not vice versa. In delivering the judgment of the court, Sarkaria J, provided a comparative table of the co-relation between ss 299 and 300 of the Indian Penal Code (which are in pari materia with ours), and also provided what I think to be a harmonious reading of the two provisions. In summary, he held:\n(a)     The first limb of s 299 (\u201cintention of causing death\u201d) and s 300(a) map onto each other and are coextensive. The inquiry is fully subjective.\n(b)     The third limb of s 299 (\u201cknowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death\u201d) corresponds with s 300(d). Both require knowledge of the probability of causing death. The main difference is in the degree of probability that death would result, with the latter requiring that the accused must know that the act in question \u201cis so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death\u201d. Once again, the inquiry is fully subjective.\n(c)     The second limb of s 299 (\u201cintention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death\u201d) is unique in that it corresponds with both ss 300(b) and 300(c). The point of commonality between all is that they all demand proof of the accused\u2019s intention to cause bodily injury. The second limb of s 299 further requires that the injury be likely to cause death. Section 300(b) requires proof of something more specific: viz, that the offender knows that the act in question will be likely to cause the death of the specific person to whom the harm is caused. Section 300(c) only requires that the injury in question be \u201csufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\u201d. In PP v Lim Poh Lye [2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (\u201cLim Poh Lye\u201d), our Court of Appeal cited the well-known decision of the Indian Supreme Court in Virsa Singh v State of Punjab [1958] SCR 1495 (\u201cVirsa Singh\u201d), and held that this s 300(c) inquiry is an objective one.",
      "47": "While s 300(b) invites a purely subjective inquiry, s 300(c) invites an inquiry which is one part subjective (of the intention of causing bodily injury), and one part objective (that the particular injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death). In order for both ss 300(b) and 300(c) to fall within the ambit of s 299, the interpretation of s 299 has to be wider than both. This explains my view at [44] above that the second limb of s 299 encompasses a subjective inquiry of the intention to cause a particular bodily injury, and an objective inquiry that the particular injury is likely to cause death. The learned authors of a local treatise on criminal law (Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan & Chan Wing Cheong, Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2012)) put it the following way (at para 9.62):",
      "48": "Nonetheless, there remains a subtle difference between the second limb of s 299 and s 300(c), which lies in the degree of probability that death would eventuate from the injury caused (see Rayavarapu Punnayya at 607G\u2013607H). For the former, proof that the injury is \u201clikely to cause death\u201d suffices. For the latter, it must be shown that the injury is \u201csufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\u201d.",
      "49": "After assessing all the evidence adduced, I was of the view that the charge had been made out. I begin with the actus reus, which the Prosecution identified as being the \u201cstabbing [of the deceased] on her neck with multiple knives\u201d (see [1] above). As set out above, the accused confessed to having inflicted injuries 14 to 16, which \u201cindividually and collectively\u201d caused the death of the deceased, establishing the actus reus (see [14], [27] and [40]).",
      "50": "Turning to the mens rea, it was also clear to me that the accused subjectively intended to inflict the particular injuries in question. The accused had deliberately retrieved the knives one after the other in order to stab the deceased in the neck. This was particularly evident in the case of the second and third injuries. After stabbing the deceased for the first time, the accused walked away, returned to the kitchen to retrieve a knife before returning to stab her in the throat one more time in order to prevent her from making a call (see [14] above). Likewise, the third injury was also deliberate and intentional. On this occasion, the accused admitted that he took another knife to perform the act so that he would not be \u201cattacked again\u201d (see [14] above), and to stop the deceased from questioning him (see [40(c)] above). In the circumstances, I found that the accused intended to cause the injuries 14 to 16.",
      "51": "On the likelihood that death would be caused, I noted that the injuries 14 to 16 had been assessed by Dr Paul to be, \u201cindividually and collectively\u201d, \u201csufficient to cause death in the ordinary cause [sic] of nature\u201d (see [28] above). I accepted the evidence. This more than satisfied the objective inquiry that the particular injuries were \u201clikely to cause death\u201d. Though it is not necessary to do so, I would go further to state that it was an irresistible inference that the accused subjectively knew that the injuries were likely to cause death. This was obvious from the serious nature of the injuries and the locations where the accused inflicted them. Further, as set out at [40(a)] above, the accused knew that, left untreated, the deceased would probably die from the injury from the first stab.",
      "52": "I should also state that given the position of the accused that he was attacked by the deceased, I also considered whether the accused could rely on the right of self-defence. After consideration, it was clear to me that he could not. Section 100 of the Penal Code provides that there is no right of private defence which extends to the causing of death unless a person faces an assault which may reasonably cause the apprehension of death or grievous hurt. The accused must establish this on a balance of probabilities. Even taking the accused\u2019s case at its highest and positing that the deceased had attempted to harm him or outrage his modesty (which I did not accept), those acts, either collectively or individually, would not give rise to the right of private defence. Under cross-examination, the accused admitted as much when he stated that he did not apprehend any threat to his life before he stabbed the accused for the first and second times (see [40(a)] and [40(b)] above).",
      "53": "For all of these reasons, I found that the Prosecution had proved the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted the accused.",
      "54": "For completeness, I would like to comment on an aspect of the Prosecution\u2019s case which somewhat troubled me. It seemed to me that there was a disconnect between the way the charge was framed and the way the Prosecution conducted their case. For one, in the course of cross-examination, the Prosecution put to the accused that he was \u201csuffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired [his] mental responsibility\u201d, and also pursued a line of questioning along the same vein. The purpose appeared to be to raise the possibility that Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code might apply (see [42] above). The problem with this approach, however, is that Exception 7 would only be engaged if the Prosecution had proved the offence of murder beyond reasonable doubt and the accused sought to have it reduced to the lesser charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. This was clearly inapplicable here because the charge, as framed, was not for the offence of murder to begin with, but culpable homicide simpliciter. Therefore, the Prosecution\u2019s approach was incongruous with the charge. In fact, the accused answered these questions in the negative, refusing to admit to his mental condition.",
      "55": "Furthermore, at para 43 of their closing submissions, the Prosecution wrote:",
      "56": "As discussed above at [46(c)], both Virsa Singh ([46] supra) and Lim Poh Lye ([46] supra) were concerned with the offence of murder as defined under s 300(c), and not the offence of culpable homicide under the second limb of s 299. The elements of the two offences are not coextensive. It was unhelpful for the Prosecution to cite authorities which discuss s 300(c) in aid of the interpretation of the second limb of s 299 without explaining how the two provisions relate to each other. This can only cause confusion, as was the case here when the Prosecution incorrectly submitted that to prove the present charge under the second limb of s 299, objectively, the injuries are \u201csufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death\u201d rather than that the injuries are \u201clikely to cause death\u201d.",
      "57": "It seemed to me that the Prosecution was trying to prove the more serious offence of murder under s 300(c), along with the application of Exception 7, so as to discharge their burden of the less serious offence of culpable homicide under s 299. For good order, the Prosecution\u2019s focus should have been to prove the charge as they had framed it and to identify the correct test for the mens rea accordingly. That being said, there was absolutely no prejudice whatsoever to the accused, and nothing material turned on these points. With that, I now turn to discuss the sentencing of the accused.",
      "58": "Section 304(a) of the Penal Code provides that whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished either with imprisonment for life (and shall also be liable to caning) or for imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years (and shall also be liable to fine or to caning).",
      "59": "In PP v Aniza bte Essa [2009] 3 SLR(R) 327 (\u201cAniza\u201d), the Court of Appeal held that the court is justified in imposing a term of life imprisonment on mentally unstable offenders for the sake of public protection where it is satisfied that the offenders will pose a \u201cserious danger to the public for an indeterminate time\u201d (see AG\u2019s Reference No 32 of 1996 (Steven Alan Whittaker) [1997] 1 Cr App R (S) 261 at 264, per Lord Bingham CJ, cited in Aniza at [14]). For this purpose, the Court of Appeal endorsed the use of the \u201cHodgson criteria\u201d, a test first articulated by the English Court of Appeal in the case of R v Rowland Jack Forster Hodgson (1968) 52 Cr App R 113. The three limbs of this test are:\n(a)     The offence or offences are in themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence (\u201cHodgson 1\u201d).\n(b)     It appears from the nature of the offences or from the defendant\u2019s history that he is a person of unstable character likely to commit such offences in the future (\u201cHodgson 2\u201d).\n(c)     If the offences are committed, the consequences to others may be specially injurious (\u201cHodgson 3\u201d).",
      "60": "From Aniza and some of the cases which have applied the Hodgson criteria, the following principles can be distilled:\n(a)     The dominant sentencing objective underpinning the Hodgson criteria is public protection (see Aniza at [12]). \u201cThe purpose of the three conditions is not to determine how evil a particular accused person can be. Rather, it is to extrapolate from his condition and his actions, the likelihood of a relapse and what the probable consequences might be\u201d (see PP v Kwok Teng Soon [2001] 3 SLR(R) 273 at [29]).\n(b)     The Hodgson criteria are cumulatively sufficient to justify the imposition of a life sentence on a mentally unstable offender (see Aniza at [34]). They provide a principled basis (public protection) for the imposition of the maximum sentence of life imprisonment on a mentally unstable offender for public protection (see Aniza at [34] and [71(a)(i)]). It is, however, not applicable to normal offenders for whom the usual test that the highest punishment should only be reserved for the worst types of cases would still apply.\n(c)     The Hodgson criteria provide a guide for distinguishing between mentally unstable offenders who pose a long-term threat and therefore need to be incarcerated for life for the sake of public protection and those who suffer from a transient illness who should be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society when it is safe to do so (see Aniza at [34] and [71(a)(ii)]). As the Court of Appeal explained, \u201cmentally unstable offenders who have committed serious offences should only be kept in prison for as long as is necessary for the protection of society (from the likelihood of recidivism), but no longer\u201d (see Aniza at [2]).\n(d)     In applying Hodgson 2, there is no need to demonstrate that the accused has a \u201chigh propensity\u201d to commit an identical offence. Instead, the court \u201cneed only be persuaded that a likelihood of such future offences being committed exists ... It would suffice that the offences contemplated fall within the broad spectrum of somewhat similar offences\u201d (see PP v Chee Cheong Hin Constance [2006] 2 SLR(R) 707 (\u201cConstance Chee\u201d) at [7]).\n(e)     The criteria \u201cjustify\u201d the imposition of a life sentence but they do not mandate it. Satisfaction of the Hodgson criteria does not invariably mean that a sentence of life imprisonment has to be imposed (see PP v Rohana [2006] SGHC 52 at [12]). The court still has to examine the facts and circumstances in their totality to determine what the appropriate sentence should be. This proviso has to be read in the light of the fact that the dominant sentencing imperative in this area is public protection.",
      "61": "The Prosecution relied on the Hodgson criteria and argued that these three criteria had been fulfilled so as to justify the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment on the accused. They submitted that the offence was \u201cshocking, brutal and grisly\u201d and that the consequences of the commission of future similar offences would undoubtedly be very grave. They also argued that the psychiatric evidence revealed that the accused has an \u201cunstable and unpredictable character\u201d, and that he is likely to commit such offences in the future. The accused shows no insight that he has a serious mental illness. He is a dangerous and unpredictable individual who committed a sudden and extreme act with little apparent warning, and he is an intelligent offender who is able to disguise his mental illness. Taken in their totality, they submitted that the best outcome would be for the accused to be placed in a facility where his consumption of antipsychotic medication can be supervised, observed and enforced where necessary.",
      "62": "Further, the Prosecution submitted that there were many aggravating factors and few mitigating factors. The accused had killed his mother in a \u201cbrutal and merciless\u201d manner and had attempted to hide evidence of his deed after the fact, revealing his impenitence. While the accused was relatively young, being 34 years old and a first-time offender, these factors were of little mitigating value, given the severity of the offence committed.",
      "63": "In his mitigation plea, the accused argued that the Hodgson criteria ([59] supra) had not been satisfied, and that a sentence of life imprisonment should not be imposed on him. The relevant extracts of what he said are set out as follows:",
      "64": "I agreed with the Prosecution that Hodgson 1 had been satisfied. This was a brutal act of violence committed in a familial context, and should attract a very long sentence. I accepted the accused\u2019s contention that the offence was not premeditated. However, even in the absence of premeditation, the offence was still very grave and clearly satisfied Hodgson 1. By the same token, it also seemed to me that Hodgson 3 had also been satisfied. If the accused were to commit offences of like nature, the consequences to others would be specially injurious. I therefore turned to Hodgson 2.",
      "65": "Hodgson 2 requires a determination whether the accused is a person of an unstable character likely to commit such offences in the future. In performing this exercise, the court is required to extrapolate from the nature of the index offence and the history of the accused whether the accused is a person who is of unstable character and therefore likely to reoffend. This is ultimately \u201can exercise in value judgment and common sense. It involves making a considered judgment concerning the unknown future based on present known facts\u201d (see PP v Barokah [2009] SGHC 46 at [60]). In performing this exercise, the court will have regard to the opinions of psychiatrists but the final assessment still rests with the court.",
      "66": "I begin with the accused\u2019s clinical history which, in my view, provided evidence that deterioration in the accused\u2019s mental state manifested itself in a propensity towards hostile and violent behaviour. To recapitulate, the accused first presented to IMH in 2006 when he was reported as having \u201cwaved knives\u201d at his uncle (see [30] above). Similarly, in the months prior to being warded for the second time in 2007, he had behaved in a \u201chostile\u201d manner towards his family members. What caused the most concern were the facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence. I agreed with Dr Koh that the offence was \u201csudden, unexpected and extreme, [and committed] with little apparent warning\u201d (see [36] above). Even accepting the accused\u2019s case at its highest, there was little by way of provocation on the deceased\u2019s part to trigger his reaction. The sheer level of violence he displayed against his mother, who had been his caregiver, was inexplicable.",
      "67": "It was clear to me that the offence had been precipitated by a rapid decline in the accused\u2019s mental state in the months preceding its commission (see [32] above). In his psychiatric report, Dr Koh assessed that at the material time, the accused\u2019s decision-making faculties were \u201csignificantly deranged from a normal state such that his judgement, impulse control and planning abilities would have been severely compromised\u201d (see [33] above). The testimony of the accused at trial supported this finding. When he was cross-examined on his motivation for the first stab, he answered:",
      "68": "He responded in a similar vein when asked why he thought there was a need to cut the deceased the third time, even after she had clearly succumbed to her injuries:",
      "69": "A parallel can be drawn with the case of PP v Hwang Yew Kong [2006] SGHC 22 (\u201cHwang Yew Kong\u201d). There, the defendant suffered from residual schizophrenia. On the day of the offence, he was in his bedroom watching television when he heard his father ask him whether he had taken his money. The defendant lost his temper, picked up a knife and proceeded to slash and stab his father, continuing to do so even after the elderly man screamed for help and collapsed onto the floor. In assessing him to be a highly dangerous individual, Tay Yong Kwang J wrote at [23] that it would \u201cbe highly unrealistic\u201d to say that he was not of unstable character. While he presented \u201ca picture of calm and normality when there [was] nothing to provoke or upset him\u201d, \u201cit would not take very much to trigger off his explosive rage and turn him into a maniacal and merciless killer\u201d [emphasis added]. In his rage, \u201che could turn brutally on someone who was very close to him and who had taken care of him all his life. His extremely violent reaction was totally out of proportion to a relatively minor accusation\u201d [emphasis added].",
      "70": "From the facts as set out at [66] and [67] above, I had no doubt that if the accused\u2019s illness could not be controlled, he would be an unstable, unpredictable and dangerous individual who would remain a serious threat to himself and to those around him. Therefore, the key question was whether his illness could be managed such that the risk to public safety would recede to a level that would justify his release. After careful consideration of all the facts and circumstances, I was not satisfied that the accused\u2019s illness could be sufficiently managed outside an institutional setting, and that he would remain a danger to the public at large for the foreseeable future. There were three inter-related points which weighed heavily in favour of such a conclusion.",
      "71": "First, I was concerned that, as reported by Dr Koh, the accused did not show any insight into the fact that he has a mental illness and of his need for treatment and medication. Prior to the offence, his family members and psychiatrists harboured suspicions that he had been defaulting on treatment. This problem was exacerbated by his refusal of depot medication, which made it even more difficult for his caregivers to ensure that he complied with his treatment regimen and took his medication regularly (see [32] above). Contrary to the accused\u2019s contention that he had been compliant in taking his medication since 2008 (see [63] above), I had little doubt that this tragic incident was due in part to the fact that he had not been in full compliance with his treatment regimen in the months preceding the offence. His lack of insight into his medical condition continued at trial, as was borne out during cross-examination when he steadfastly denied that he suffered from a mental illness at the material time:",
      "72": "In PP v Mohammad Zam bin Abdul Rashid [2006] SGHC 168 (\u201cMohammad Zam\u201d), the offender pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. He suffered from Frontal Lobe Syndrome (\u201cFLS\u201d), which manifested in a significant alternation of habitual patterns of behaviour and a loss of control over the expression of emotions, needs and impulses. The evidence was that FLS, while irreversible, could still be managed with the aid of a strict treatment regimen which would reduce the violent tendencies and improve the accused\u2019s impulse control. However, Tay Yong Kwang J held (at [35]) that he had \u201cno confidence at all in his [ie, the offender\u2019s] undertakings that he will comply with medication and continue with treatment upon his release, bearing in mind his history and despite the realisation that he is suffering from FLS\u201d [emphasis added] and that he \u201cvery much doubt[ed] that the [offender] will have the discipline to adhere to such a regime outside the confines of incarceration\u201d (at [39]).",
      "73": "Returning to the present facts, given the accused\u2019s refusal to fully acknowledge his mental illness and his previous reluctance to comply with treatment, I had no doubt that left to his devices, the accused would default on his treatment and medication.",
      "74": "Second, the accused\u2019s intelligence (as evinced by the articulate responses during the trial) had served to assist him in hiding his symptoms, even from professionals trained in the assessment of psychiatric disorders (see [34] above). As observed by Dr Koh, in the years leading up to the present offence, he had already demonstrated his capacity and ability to conceal symptoms of his illness from those around him. This meant that it would be extremely difficult for any treatment regimen to be enforced unless he received close supervision and regular medical attention.",
      "75": "Third, I noted that there was no evidence of any post-release plan for the care of the accused. In cases involving individuals with mental disorders, an important consideration is the presence of strong familial and social structures for the enforcement of the prescribed treatment regimen outside of a controlled environment such as that of a prison (see Mohammad Zam and PP v Lim Ah Liang [2007] SGHC 34). In Constance Chee ([60] supra), the offender\u2019s three sisters had each sworn affidavits undertaking to assume responsibility for the offender\u2019s future medical care and supervision upon her release from incarceration. On the strength of these undertakings, V K Rajah J (as he then was) held that the offender\u2019s illness could be adequately managed such that her propensity for violence would sufficiently recede to the point at which it could be said that she would no longer be a real danger to the public.",
      "76": "Before me, there were no indications that there would be anyone who would be able or willing to take care of the accused upon his release, let alone provide any guarantees as those furnished in Constance Chee. I was mindful of the fact that prior to the offence, the accused had been cared for by the deceased and his uncle, and that he lived with his siblings. The deceased is now gone and there was no basis to believe that his uncle and siblings would be able or willing to provide the requisite supervision and care.",
      "77": "From the foregoing, I reiterate my earlier statement that if the accused\u2019s illness cannot be controlled, he would remain an unstable, unpredictable and dangerous individual, and pose a serious threat to himself and to those around him. As Dr Koh opined, paranoid schizophrenia is a condition that requires long-term medication and treatment, without which a relapse would be highly likely (see [35] above). Even with a strict treatment plan, there is no guarantee, as Dr Koh has clarified, that the accused\u2019s condition would not worsen. I concluded that the likelihood of recidivism existed, and that it would remain unless the accused remained in a controlled environment in which his treatment and medication may be supervised and enforced. The requirement set out in Hodgson 2 had thus been satisfied and the Hodgson criteria ([59] supra) had been satisfied.",
      "78": "At this juncture, it is appropriate to deal with the matters put forth by the accused in his mitigation. It seemed to me that the accused was making three points. First, the accused distinguished the precedent cases cited by the Prosecution on the ground that the present offence was not premeditated. Presumably, his contention was that the present offence was not as serious or grave as those in the precedent cases and that, consequently, he ought not to receive a sentence of life imprisonment. However, as set out at [60(a)], the Hodgson criteria provide an alternative to the principle that the highest punishment should only be reserved for the worst types of cases. As indicated, the Hodgson criteria had been satisfied. Also, I have already expressed my view that this was indeed a serious and grave offence.",
      "79": "Second, the accused seemed to challenge the psychiatric evidence, especially regarding how one goes about assessing a person who appears normal to be of an unstable character. In particular, the accused said that the psychiatric reports were merely based on short interviews over the two years (see [63] above). I rejected this argument. The psychiatric reports were based on interviews with the accused, previous medical records with IMH, interviews with the family members and observations made by the medical officers who attended to the accused while in remand. I found the psychiatric evidence credible. Further, I did not rely on the conclusions of Dr Koh uncritically but also checked to see that they were supported by the accused\u2019s testimony in court (see [67], [70] and [73]) before arriving at the conclusion that the accused was a person of unstable character who would be likely to commit similar offences in the future if treatment were not enforced.",
      "80": "Third, the accused submitted that since 2008, he has been compliant with his treatment and medication. As set out at [70], I did not accept this.",
      "81": "In my judgment, based on the Hodgson criteria, a sentence of life imprisonment was justified. Having reviewed all the other facts and circumstances, including matters stated by the accused, I found no other considerations that militated against the imposition of such a sentence. Accordingly, I so ordered. Following the lead of Tay J in Hwang Yew Kong ([68] supra) at [20], I did not think that caning was warranted given the accused\u2019s mental condition. I therefore made no order for caning.",
      "82": "This has been a terrible tragedy for the family. It has taken away the life of the deceased and has resulted in the incarceration of the accused. For Daniel, Sunil and Sheena who witnessed the immediate aftermath of the offence, the toll this has exacted on their lives must be tremendous. One can only hope that with time, there will be some measure of closure and healing."

Judicial decisions, if they are to mean anything at all, must confer certainty and stability. People must be able to order their affairs according to the settled conviction that the last word of the court is the last word, and that the last full stop in a written judgment is not liable to be turned into an open-ended and uncertain ellipsis. As Harlan J said in Mackey v United States 401 US 667 (1971) at 690\u2013691:",
      "2": "However, the cost of error in the criminal process is measured not in monetary terms, but in terms of the liberty and, sometimes, even the life of an individual. For this reason, where criminal cases are concerned, the principle of finality cannot be applied in as unyielding a manner as in the civil context, and it seems that the court should, in exceptional cases, be able to review its previous decisions where it is necessary to correct a miscarriage of injustice. The question would then be this: when do these conditions obtain? In the present criminal motion (\u201cthe Present Application\u201d), we confront this very issue.",
      "3": "In 2010, the applicant in the Present Application, Jabing Kho (\u201cthe Applicant\u201d), was tried and convicted of the offence of murder, and was sentenced to suffer the then mandatory punishment of death: see PP v Galing Anak Kujat [2010] SGHC 212 (\u201cHC (Conviction)\u201d) (the said Galing Anak Kujat in this case report was the Applicant\u2019s co-accused at the trial). The Applicant\u2019s appeal against his conviction was dismissed in 2011 (see Kho Jabing v PP [2011] 3 SLR 634 (\u201cCA (Conviction)\u201d)). Following the enactment of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 32 of 2012) (\u201cthe 2012 Amendment Act\u201d), all persons who commit the offence of murder, save for those who commit murder within the meaning of s 300(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe PC\u201d), may be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment and caning instead of being sentenced to death. Crucially, the 2012 Amendment Act also provided that all persons who were convicted of murder before the entry into force of the Act could apply to be re-sentenced under the new sentencing framework.",
      "4": "The Applicant duly applied to be re-sentenced. On 30 April 2013, the Court of Appeal clarified that he was guilty of murder within the meaning of s 300(c) of the PC and remitted the matter to the High Court for a fresh sentence to be passed. On 14 August 2013, a High Court judge (\u201cthe Re-sentencing Judge\u201d) re-sentenced the Applicant to a term of life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane (see PP v Kho Jabing [2014] 1 SLR 973 (\u201cHC (Re-sentencing)\u201d)). The Prosecution appealed and the matter came before us. On 14 January 2015, we allowed the Prosecution\u2019s appeal by a majority of 3:2, and substituted the sentence of life imprisonment and caning with a sentence of death (see PP v Kho Jabing [2015] 2 SLR 112) (\u201cCA (Re-sentencing)\u201d)). The Applicant then petitioned the President of the Republic of Singapore for clemency, but his application was rejected, and on 19 October 2015, the President ordered that the sentence of death be carried into effect on 6 November 2015.",
      "5": "On 3 November 2015, Mr Ravi s/o Madasamy filed Criminal Motion No 23 of 2015 (\u201cCM 23/2015\u201d) seeking to have the Applicant\u2019s conviction set aside on the ground that it was unconstitutional. On 4 November 2015, the Applicant applied by way of the Present Application to set aside the sentence of death imposed on him. The Attorney-General was named as the respondent in CM 23/2015, while the Public Prosecutor was named as the respondent in the Present Application. Both applications were scheduled for hearing before us on an urgent basis, and we heard them on the morning of 5 November 2015. At the start of the hearing, counsel for the Applicant, Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair, informed us that he had only been instructed the day before and therefore had not had sufficient time to prepare his client\u2019s case. In the circumstances, we thought it fair and prudent to adjourn both applications, and ordered that the sentence of death imposed on the Applicant be stayed pending their determination.",
      "6": "At the resumed hearing of the applications on 23 November 2015, Mr Ravi applied to withdraw CM 23/2015. We granted that request, but clarified that as a result of the withdrawal, the issue of whether Mr Ravi had the locus standi to bring the application (the Public Prosecutor contended that he did not) did not arise for decision, and further, that we expressed no views on that issue. We then heard Mr Mohan on the merits of the Present Application and reserved judgment.",
      "7": "In broad terms, the Present Application raises two issues. The first is whether, and in what circumstances, the Court of Appeal may reopen its previous decision in a concluded criminal appeal, which was to have been final. The second is whether it should do so in the present case. We will discuss each issue in turn.",
      "8": "Applications to reopen concluded criminal appeals have burgeoned. In 2015, 11 criminal motions of this nature were filed by accused persons in the Court of Appeal alone: six seeking leave to appeal against the outcome of Magistrate\u2019s Appeals and five seeking to move this court to re-examine its own decisions in concluded criminal appeals arising from decisions made by the High Court at first instance. Of these 11 criminal motions, eight were dismissed summarily for being wholly without merit (oftentimes without the respondent in the application concerned being called on to respond); one was withdrawn; one has yet to be heard; while the last (the Present Application, which was also the last criminal motion of this nature filed in this court in 2015), we reserved to consider more carefully. This figure does not include the innumerable criminal motions filed in the High Court, some of which, we have no doubt, also sought to have the High Court reopen its previous decisions in concluded Magistrate\u2019s Appeals, there being no avenue for a further appeal against a decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its appellate criminal jurisdiction.",
      "9": "We do not think the present state of affairs conduces to justice. As Jackson J candidly remarked in Brown v Allen 344 US 443 (1953) at 537, \u201c[i]t must prejudice the occasional meritorious application to be buried in a flood of worthless ones\u201d. We are still paradigmatically a one-appeal jurisdiction. The filing of unmeritorious applications to reopen concluded criminal appeals takes up valuable resources which can and should go towards the disposal of cases which are coming up on appeal for the first time. For this reason, we propose to lay down some guidelines to explain when, and in what circumstances, this court should reopen a concluded criminal appeal. First, we will examine the way in which this issue has developed in our jurisprudence. Second, we will consider the position in other jurisdictions in search of guiding principles which may be used to develop a coherent system in Singapore. Finally, we will gather up the threads of our analysis and distil certain guidelines for application in future cases.",
      "10": "Prior to 2010, this court held, in a quartet of decisions, that once it had delivered its judgment in a criminal appeal, it was functus officio and had no jurisdiction to reopen the matter and reconsider its substantive merits: see Abdullah bin A Rahman v PP [1994] 2 SLR(R) 1017 (\u201cAbdullah\u201d), Lim Choon Chye v PP [1994] 2 SLR(R) 1024, Jabar bin Kadermastan v PP [1995] 1 SLR(R) 326 and Vignes s/o Mourthi v PP [2003] 4 SLR(R) 518 (\u201cVignes\u201d). These cases will be collectively referred to hereafter as \u201cthe Vignes line of decisions\u201d. The reason given was that once this court had heard and disposed of an appeal, its statutorily-conferred appellate jurisdiction ceased; and as a creature of statute, it did not, in the absence of specific statutory authorisation, have any jurisdiction to reopen the case to entertain further arguments on the merits of the matter (see Vignes at [4]). We will refer to this line of argument as \u201cthe functus officio argument\u201d.",
      "11": "In Koh Zhan Quan Tony v PP [2006] 2 SLR(R) 830 (\u201cKoh Tony\u201d), an important gloss was added to the above position. The applicants in Koh Tony were charged with murder, but were convicted by the High Court of the lesser offence of robbery with hurt. Upon appeal by the Prosecution in Criminal Appeal No 2 of 2005 (\u201cCCA 2/2005\u201d), the Court of Appeal reversed the High Court\u2019s decision, substituting the convictions for robbery with hurt with convictions for murder. The applicants then filed criminal motions arguing that the Court of Appeal did not have the jurisdiction to hear CCA 2/2005 because the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (we will hereafter refer to this Act and its legislative successors generically as \u201cthe SCJA\u201d) only permitted the Prosecution to appeal against the acquittal of an accused, which, the applicants argued, was not the position in their case because they had in fact been convicted, albeit of a lesser offence. The Prosecution argued that the criminal motions should be dismissed in limine on the basis that the Court of Appeal, having already disposed of the substantive merits of CCA 2/2005, was functus officio and therefore had no jurisdiction to consider the motions.",
      "12": "The Court of Appeal took the objection in two parts. First, it considered whether it had the jurisdiction \u2013 in the sense of \u201cauthority ... to hear and determine a dispute that is brought before it\u201d (see Muhd Munir v Noor Hidah [1990] 2 SLR(R) 348 (\u201cMuhd Munir\u201d) at [19]) \u2013 to hear the criminal motions. The court held that it did. The gist of the criminal motions was whether the court had the jurisdiction to hear CCA 2/2005 in the first place. The court held that this was a matter which ought to have formed part of CCA 2/2005, and thus, \u201c[the] court remains properly seised of the present case in so far as the question of jurisdiction is concerned\u201d [emphasis in original] (see Koh Tony at [23]). Second, the court considered whether it had the power \u2013 in the sense of the \u201ccapacity to give effect to its determination by making or granting the orders or reliefs sought by the successful party\u201d (see Muhd Munir at [19]) \u2013 to determine the issue raised in the criminal motions. The court likewise held that it did because s 29A(4) of the SCJA gave it \u201cfull power to determine any question necessary to be determined for the purpose of doing justice in any case before the Court\u201d, and there was no doubt that the question of whether the court even had the jurisdiction to hear CCA 2/2005 to begin with satisfied this criterion.",
      "13": "Having concluded that it had both the jurisdiction and the power to hear the criminal motions, the court then went on to say that even though the matters presented in the criminal motions \u201cought, ideally, to have been raised and considered during the hearing of [CCA 2/2005]\u201d [emphasis in original omitted] (see Koh Tony at [19]), two factors weighed in favour of hearing the criminal motions. The first was the importance of the legal issue raised, which, the court observed, was one that \u201cwould have a potentially significant impact on future cases\u201d [emphasis in original] (see likewise Koh Tony at [19]); the second was the gravity of the matter, viz, \u201c[it was] a criminal appeal involving a final appellate court where life and liberty are at stake\u201d [emphasis in original] (at [24]). However, the court clarified that its decision was \u201cconfined to the precise question of whether the court has the jurisdiction and power to consider if the earlier court had the jurisdiction to entertain [CCA 2/2005]\u201d [emphasis in original] (at [29]). The court also clarified that it remained functus officio as far as the substantive merits of CCA 2/2005 were concerned as it had \u201calready heard and ruled on the issues associated therewith\u201d (at [22]).",
      "14": "Even though the Court of Appeal in Koh Tony took pains to maintain fidelity with the Vignes line of decisions, it also ameliorated the strictness of that line of authorities. The position after Koh Tony was that if an application to reopen a concluded criminal appeal was premised on a challenge to the Court of Appeal\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the appeal in the first place, the court would still be seised of jurisdiction to hear the matter even though it had already ruled on the merits of the appeal. Although the position taken by this court in Koh Tony was framed as a narrow exception to the Vignes line of decisions, it was in effect a significant departure. Prior to Koh Tony, the position had been that the Court of Appeal\u2019s jurisdiction was completely exhausted by the disposal of the criminal appeal before it, and thus, the court did not have any residual jurisdiction to entertain any further applications in relation to the matter, be it a further appeal, an application to adduce further evidence, an application for a review or otherwise. That was no longer the case after Koh Tony.",
      "15": "It did not take long for the inroads made by Koh Tony to flower. In Yong Vui Kong v PP [2010] 2 SLR 192 (\u201cYong Vui Kong (Jurisdiction)\u201d), the applicant had earlier been convicted of trafficking in a quantity of drugs that attracted the death penalty. He had filed a notice of appeal, but had subsequently elected to withdraw his appeal. Sometime later, he filed a criminal motion petitioning the Court of Appeal to treat his previous withdrawal of his appeal as a nullity and to restore his appeal for hearing. The Prosecution argued that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to hear the criminal motion because the applicant\u2019s appeal, once withdrawn, was deemed to have been dismissed on its merits, and thus, the court was functus officio and could not hear any further appeal against the applicant\u2019s conviction.",
      "16": "On the facts, the Court of Appeal held that the applicant had been labouring under a fundamental mistake when he withdrew his appeal. He had been under the impression then that he would have to lie to the court in order to pursue his appeal (which would have run counter to his settled religious convictions), but this was incorrect because it was open to him to challenge his conviction and sentence solely on legal grounds. Thus, the court held that the applicant\u2019s withdrawal of his appeal was a nullity and allowed him to proceed with his appeal (at [28]). For present purposes, what is more important is that the court went on, in a lengthy obiter dictum, to express its view that even if the substantive merits of the appeal had already been heard and decided, it might still have the jurisdiction to hear further arguments on those substantive merits. At [16], Chan Sek Keong CJ, who delivered the grounds of decision of the court, said:",
      "17": "The passage just quoted represented the quietus of the functus officio argument. There is no question that jurisdiction (in the sense of authority) can only be conferred by statute (see Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario [2013] 3 SLR 258 at [14]\u2013[20]). However, whenever a matter before the Court of Appeal concerns an appeal against a decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction, this court is already properly seised of jurisdiction pursuant to s 29A(2) of the SCJA. The only issue is whether this statutorily-conferred jurisdiction comes to an end once a decision is made on the substantive merits of the appeal. On this, the SCJA is silent. However, if one accepts the central premise in Koh Tony ([11] supra) \u2013 viz, that the Court of Appeal\u2019s jurisdiction in respect of a criminal appeal is not exhausted by the rendering of a decision on the substantive merits (which is the antithesis of the functus officio argument) \u2013 then the demise of the functus officio argument is inevitable.",
      "18": "Even though it did not say so explicitly, the Court of Appeal in Yong Vui Kong (Jurisdiction) appeared to accept the premise of Koh Tony. It was on this basis that the court held that the operative question was not whether it could reconsider its previous decision in a concluded criminal appeal (in the sense of whether it had the jurisdiction to do so), but whether it should (in the sense of whether it should exercise its power to do so). At [14]\u2013[15] of Yong Vui Kong (Jurisdiction), the court said:",
      "19": "We thus see a gradual shift in the attitude of the Court of Appeal where reviews of its previous decisions in concluded criminal appeals are concerned. Whereas it once confined reviews to the specific question of whether it even had the requisite jurisdiction to hear the appeal to begin with, it now indicated (albeit obiter) that it was prepared to review the merits of its earlier decision if it would be in the interests of justice to do so. The principle stated by Chan CJ in Yong Vui Kong (Jurisdiction) was that the Court of Appeal should engage in a review of the merits \u201cwhere there is sufficient material on which the court can say that there has been a miscarriage of justice\u201d (at [15]).",
      "20": "After the decision in Yong Vui Kong (Jurisdiction), there were three instances where this court reconsidered the substantive merits of a concluded criminal appeal: Ramalingam Ravinthran v AG [2012] 2 SLR 49 (\u201cRamalingam\u201d), Yong Vui Kong v PP [2012] 2 SLR 872 (\u201cYong Vui Kong (Prosecutorial Discretion)\u201d) and Quek Hock Lye v PP [2015] 2 SLR 563 (\u201cQuek Hock Lye\u201d). These cases share three common features: (a) first, all these cases involved attempts by an accused person to reopen a criminal appeal which had been decided against him (see Ramalingam at [16], Yong Vui Kong (Prosecutorial Discretion) at [1(a)] and Quek Hock Lye at [22]); (b) second, all three cases involved constitutional issues which had not been considered at the hearing of the appeal and which, depending on how they were resolved, could have an impact on the outcome of the appeal; and (c) third, all of them involved the imposition of a capital sentence.",
      "21": "In Ramalingam, the applicant was convicted and sentenced in 2009 for trafficking in a quantity of drugs which attracted capital punishment, and his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in 2011. Thereafter, he filed a criminal motion in the Court of Appeal arguing that his right to equal treatment under Art 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (\u201cthe Constitution\u201d) had been violated by the Attorney-General\u2019s decision to prosecute a co-offender involved in the same criminal enterprise on a non-capital charge. On that basis, the applicant sought to set aside the sentence of death imposed on him and have it replaced with a non-capital sentence. The Prosecution argued that the Court of Appeal, having already delivered its judgment on the applicant\u2019s appeal, was functus officio and no longer had the jurisdiction to hear his criminal motion.",
      "22": "The court disagreed, and in the process, made a number of observations about the juridical basis of its authority and power to reopen concluded criminal appeals. The court began by distinguishing between two distinct but related concepts. The first was the principle of functus officio, which, it stated, applied to the court and related to the exhaustion of the court\u2019s jurisdiction (at [10]); the second was the principle of finality, which was a broader concept that applied to prevent parties from re-litigating issues that had already been decided by the court (at [11]). The court went on to explain that in the criminal context, the line between the two was blurred. At [12]\u2013[13], the court stated (per Chan CJ):",
      "23": "In the criminal context, the bar to reopening a concluded appeal is premised more on policy concerns over finality rather than on the ground of the Court of Appeal\u2019s lack of jurisdiction. Thus, following Koh Tony ([11] supra) and Yong Vui Kong (Jurisdiction) ([15] supra), the question is one of whether the court\u2019s power to review a concluded criminal appeal should be exercised. On the facts of Ramalingam, the court decided to hear the applicant\u2019s criminal motion because the substantive issue in contention \u2013 viz, the relationship between the prosecutorial discretion conferred on the Attorney-General under Art 35(8) of the Constitution and the right to equality before the law under Art 12(1) of the same \u2013 was one which \u201cneed[ed] to be examined in greater detail and clarified in the public interest\u201d (at [17]).",
      "24": "In summary, the approach taken in Singapore thus far has been one of incremental development. At present, the position seems to be that this court has the inherent power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal to correct mistakes \u201cin circumstances where there is sufficient material on which the court can say that there has been a miscarriage of justice\u201d (see Yong Vui Kong (Jurisdiction) at [15]). This power, which we will refer to as the power of \u201creview\u201d to distinguish it from both the usual appellate function of this court and the quite different revisionary jurisdiction which the High Court exercises over inferior tribunals, is one whose ambit has yet to be fully explored.",
      "25": "We now turn to consider the position in some other jurisdictions. Before we proceed, we ought to point out that many jurisdictions have pursued a solution through legislation. For obvious reasons, some of the solutions which they have fashioned through legislative intervention are not available to this court. However, the principles which undergird their operation are. And it is to these principles that we turn in order to derive some guidance.",
      "26": "Until recently, the position in England and Wales was that no appeal could be reopened once it had been decided on the merits, save for a limited exception which applied only to decisions of the House of Lords (see K R Handley, Spencer Bower and Handley: Res Judicata (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2009) at para 5.06). This rule also applied to criminal appeals, even where there was fresh evidence (see Regina v Pinfold [1988] QB 462). In the criminal context, this absolute bar admitted of only two exceptions. The first was where the decision of the court was a nullity; the second was where there had been a defect in procedure which had occasioned injustice (see Regina v Daniel [1977] 2 WLR 394 (\u201cR v Daniel\u201d)).",
      "27": "The law in England and Wales underwent a sea change with the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Taylor v Lawrence [2002] 3 WLR 640 (\u201cTaylor\u201d). The issue in Taylor was whether an appeal should be reopened on the ground that there was new evidence which disclosed that the appellate court\u2019s decision might have been tainted by apparent bias. Although the application to reopen the appeal in question was dismissed on its merits, the English Court of Appeal held, as a matter of law, that it had the power to reopen a concluded appeal \u201cto avoid real injustice in exceptional circumstances\u201d (at [54]). This power, the court explained, arose out of its character as a court of justice and was \u201cnecessary to achieve the dual objectives of an appellate court\u201d (at [50]), which were, first, to ensure justice between the litigants and, second, to ensure public confidence in the administration of justice by remedying wrong decisions as well as by clarifying and developing the law and setting precedents (at [26]).",
      "28": "The ruling in Taylor was soon codified by the introduction of r 52.17 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998 No 3132) (UK) (\u201cthe English CPR\u201d), which provided that the English Court of Appeal and the English High Court had the power to reopen a final determination of an appeal where the following three cumulative conditions were met (see r 52.17(1)):\n(a)     it was necessary to do so in order to avoid real injustice;\n(b)     the circumstances were exceptional and made it appropriate to reopen the appeal; and\n(c)     there was no alternative effective remedy.",
      "29": "In the later case of In re Uddin (A Child) [2005] 1 WLR 2398 (\u201cUddin\u201d), the central question related to the circumstances in which it could be said that the facts were so \u201cexceptional\u201d that recourse to r 52.17 of the English CPR was appropriate. In Uddin, the English High Court had earlier held that a mother had attempted to cause serious injury to her child. The mother applied to the English Court of Appeal for leave to appeal against the English High Court\u2019s decision, but was unsuccessful. A few months later, the mother applied to the English Court of Appeal to reopen her application for leave to appeal on the ground that there was new evidence that cast doubt on the expert evidence upon which the English High Court\u2019s decision had been based.",
      "30": "The English Court of Appeal dismissed the mother\u2019s application to reopen her earlier leave application. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P, delivering the judgment of the court, started by considering the threshold that had to be met before a concluded \u201cappeal\u201d (which is defined in r 52.17(2) of the English CPR as including an application for leave to appeal) would be reopened \u2013 ie, \u201chow exceptional is exceptional?\u201d (see Uddin at [16]). In her view, the case had to be one \u201cwhere it is demonstrated that the integrity of the earlier litigation process, whether at trial or at the first appeal, has been critically undermined\u201d (at [18]). The reason for this, she explained, was that a court exercising its jurisdiction under r 52.17 was not \u201csolely concerned with the case where the earlier process has or may have produced a wrong result [that being the domain of an appeal] ... but rather, at least primarily, with special circumstances where the process itself has been corrupted\u201d (at [18]). According to Dame Elizabeth, it was this \u201ccorruption of justice\u201d [emphasis in original] (at [18]) that, as a matter of policy, was \u201cmost likely to validate an exceptional recourse; a recourse that relegates the high importance of finality in litigation to second place\u201d and justified the reopening of a concluded appeal (at [18]).",
      "31": "It is important to note that Dame Elizabeth did not go so far as to say that the introduction of fresh evidence could in no circumstances justify the reopening of a concluded appeal in the absence of some other factor which had corrupted the litigation process. She held that while a case where the litigation process had been corrupted was \u201cthe paradigm case\u201d, it was not necessarily the only case (at [20]). She explained that it might be possible for the discovery of fresh evidence to justify reopening a concluded appeal if \u201cthe injustice that would be perpetrated if the appeal is not reopened [is] ... so grave as to overbear the pressing claims of finality in litigation\u201d [emphasis added] (at [21]). In this regard, it was not sufficient to show a \u201creal possibility\u201d that the previous decision was wrong; instead, the party seeking to reopen the appeal had to go further to show that there was a \u201cpowerful probability\u201d that an erroneous result had in fact been arrived at (at [22]). In closing, Dame Elizabeth succinctly summarised the position in the following manner (at [22]):",
      "32": "In the recent case of Regina v Yasain [2015] 3 WLR 1571 (\u201cYasain\u201d), the Criminal Division of the English Court of Appeal had occasion to consider whether it likewise had the power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal. We will return to the facts of the case at a later stage (see [72] below), but the point to be made for now is that the court held (at [38] of Yasain) that although Taylor was a civil case, the principles articulated therein were also relevant in the criminal context, and the Criminal Division of the English Court of Appeal likewise had the power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal. However, the court observed that this power would not be exercised in the same way in the criminal context because of the differences between civil and criminal cases, and opined that it would be best if a separate set of rules similar to those in r 52.17 of the English CPR could be formulated for criminal cases (at [40]). On the facts, the court held, applying Taylor, that the case before it was one where the appeal in question ought to be reopened.",
      "33": "Before we leave the English position, we should say a few words about the Criminal Cases Review Commission (\u201cthe CCRC\u201d). The CCRC was set up in the wake of the public outcry over the conviction (and later exoneration) of the so-called \u201cBirmingham Six\u201d (see David Kyle, \u201cCorrecting Miscarriages of Justice: The Role of the Criminal Cases Review Commission\u201d (2004) 52 Drake L Rev 657 at pp 660\u2013662). It is an independent body which, although not itself able to quash convictions or reduce sentences (that remains the exclusive preserve of the courts), is nevertheless able to refer cases to the English Court of Appeal to be reheard in appropriate cases. Section 13(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 (c 35) (UK) provides that a reference is not to be made unless:\n(a)     the CCRC considers that \u201cthere is a real possibility that the [decision in question] would not be upheld were the reference to be made\u201d (see s 13(1)(a)); and\n(b)     the CCRC takes this view because of, inter alia, \u201can argument, or evidence, not raised in the proceedings which led to [the decision] or on any appeal or application for leave to appeal against it\u201d (see s 13(1)(b)(i)); and\n(c)     all avenues of appeal have already been exhausted, be it by the determination of an appeal or by the refusal of leave to appeal (see s 13(1)(c)).",
      "34": "In our view, this is very much in keeping with the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the CCRC \u2013 it is intended only as a line of last defence to detect cases which would otherwise slip through the cracks.",
      "35": "Until recently, the position in Hong Kong mirrored that which existed in England and Wales before Taylor ([27] supra). After the order of an appellate court in a criminal appeal (be it an order allowing the appeal or one dismissing it) had been perfected, the court could only reopen its decision and recall or vary its order if the order was a nullity or if there was a procedural error which had occasioned an injustice (see Secretary for Justice v Mak Wai Hon [2000] 1 HKC 498). However, in HKSAR v Tin\u2019s Label Factory Ltd [2008] HKCU 1899, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal reviewed the developments that had taken place in England post-Taylor and remarked, obiter, that the approach adopted there \u201cmerits serious adoption in Hong Kong\u201d, although it also cautioned that \u201cthe residual discretion is a wholly exceptional jurisdiction and the occasions when it may properly be invoked would be extremely rare\u201d (at [56]).",
      "36": "In Brian Alfred Hall v HKSAR [2014] 4 HKC 500 (\u201cHall\u201d), the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal had to consider whether it had the power to reopen an appeal that had been allowed due to fraud on the part of the accused. The accused had earlier been convicted of common assault of prison officers after a trial in the Magistrates\u2019 Court, and had been sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, he adduced statements of certain prison officers which differed materially from the prosecution witnesses\u2019 statements and their testimony at the trial. Upon production of those statements, the Prosecution conceded the appeal and the accused\u2019s common assault conviction was quashed. Subsequently, it turned out that those statements had been forged on the accused\u2019s instructions. The accused was then separately charged with four counts of perverting the course of justice, and sentenced to a total of six years and nine months\u2019 imprisonment. Thereafter, the Prosecution applied to the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal to reopen the appeal in respect of the accused\u2019s common assault conviction with a view towards reinstating his conviction and sentence.",
      "37": "The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal said at [11]:",
      "38": "The court emphasised that in deciding whether to exercise its power to reopen an appeal, it had to \u201ctake all relevant considerations into account\u201d (at [12]). In particular, it was \u201cnecessary first to consider what purpose would be served by reopening the appeal\u201d [emphasis added] (likewise at [12]). Given the already substantial sentence imposed on the accused for perverting the course of justice, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal held that reopening the appeal in respect of his common assault conviction would only have symbolic value, and that the judicial and public resources which would have to be spent were the appeal to be reopened would be wholly disproportionate to the object to be achieved. In the circumstances, the court declined to exercise its power to reopen the appeal.",
      "39": "In Australia, the approach is bifurcated. It has long been held that intermediate appellate courts (pertinently, for present purposes, the Courts of Criminal Appeal of the various Australian States) are unable to reopen a concluded appeal (see Burrell v R (2008) 248 ALR 428 (\u201cBurrell\u201d) at [22]). By contrast, where the High Court of Australia is concerned, it is now well established that it has the power \u201cas the final national court of appeal, in exceptional circumstances, to repair its own mistakes and oversights that would otherwise occasion a serious and irremediable injustice, despite the fact that its orders have been formalised\u201d (see Burrell at [105]). Given that only one tier of appeal is available in respect of criminal cases in Singapore, the distinction between intermediate and final appellate courts is not relevant, and we do not propose to dwell on it.",
      "40": "Although, as we have just mentioned, an intermediate appellate court in Australia has no power to reopen a concluded appeal, a further appeal against the court\u2019s decision may lie if the High Court of Australia grants special leave for an appeal to be brought. That said, the High Court of Australia rarely grants such leave, and thus, the final avenue for review in a criminal matter usually lies in a petition for mercy (see R v GAM (No 2) [2004] VSCA 117 at [11]). Legislative developments in some Australian States have, however, introduced a new dimension to the legal landscape. In 2013, the State of South Australia passed the Statutes Amendment (Appeals) Act 2013 (No 9 of 2013) (SA) to insert a new s 353A into its Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) so as to provide accused persons with an opportunity for a \u201csecond or subsequent appeal\u201d in limited circumstances. The relevant provisions of the new s 353A read:",
      "41": "Of particular interest are the definitions of \u201cfresh\u201d and \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence in s 353A(6). In order to be \u201cfresh\u201d, the evidence in question must not have been adduced at the trial, and must be something which \u201ccould not, even with the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been adduced at the trial\u201d (see s 353A(6)(a)). And in order to be \u201ccompelling\u201d, the evidence concerned has to be \u201creliable\u201d, \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201chighly probative in the context of the issues in dispute at the trial of the offence\u201d (see s 353A(6)(b)). In 2015, Tasmania passed the Criminal Code Amendment (Second or Subsequent Appeal for Fresh and Compelling Evidence) Act 2015 (No 41 of 2015) (Tas). Section 9 of that Act, which is modelled after the South Australian statute, likewise permits a second appeal to be brought (with leave) only if there is \u201cfresh and compelling\u201d evidence.",
      "42": "In Malaysia, in Dato\u2019 See Teow Chuan v Ooi Woon Chee [2013] 4 MLJ 351, Arifin Zakaria CJ, delivering the unanimous judgment of the Federal Court of Malaysia, stated definitively that the Federal Court had the inherent power to review any matter already decided by the court where it was necessary \u201cto do justice and to prevent an abuse of process\u201d (at [10]). The court clarified that \u201c[t]his power springs not from legislation but from the nature and constitution of the court as a dispenser of justice ... [and] can only be taken away by express provision in any written law\u201d (likewise at [10]). The court cautioned, however, that this power was to be exercised only in \u201cspecial and exceptional\u201d circumstances and could not be used as an avenue for a further appeal (at [15]).",

      "44": "Abdul Hamid Mohamad CJ then went on to give five non-exhaustive instances in which the Malaysian Federal Court\u2019s power of review might be exercised. These included circumstances where the court was inquorate, where the applicant had been denied the right to be heard, where the decision had been procured by fraud, where the court had applied a law which had since been repealed, or where bias had been established (see Asean Security Paper Mills at [7]\u2013[11]). These examples were endorsed by Zaki Tun Azmi PCA, who delivered the other reasoned judgment in that case. On the facts, the Malaysian Federal Court dismissed the application for review because it fell outside the limited scope of the court\u2019s review jurisdiction.",
      "45": "Gathering up the threads of the foregoing analysis, several propositions can be distilled:\n(a)     First, a final appellate court has the inherent power, by virtue of its character as a court of justice, to correct its own mistakes in order to prevent miscarriages of justice or, to use a cognate expression favoured in England, \u201creal injustice\u201d.\n(b)     Second, this power of review is to be exercised sparingly, and only in circumstances which can be described as \u201cexceptional\u201d and which therefore override the imperative of finality.\n(c)     Third, a review by a final appellate court is distinct from and should not be confused with an appeal. In conducting a review, the court is primarily concerned not with the correctness of the decision under review, but with whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. These concepts are not the same. The paradigm case of a miscarriage of justice is where there has been a breach of natural justice.\n(d)     Fourth, the substratum of an application for review should be new material that was not previously canvassed in the proceedings leading to the decision under challenge. The material in question must demonstrate a \u201cpowerful probability\u201d that there has been a miscarriage of justice which warrants invoking the court\u2019s review jurisdiction.\n(e)     Finally, this power of review is available in both civil and criminal cases, although the rules governing its exercise might differ depending on the context.",
      "46": "Having reflected on the various tests which a final appellate court may adopt to decide whether it should review a case which has already exhausted the appeal process, we are satisfied that for a criminal matter, the general test enunciated by this court in Yong Vui Kong (Jurisdiction) ([15] supra) at [15] \u2013 viz, that there must be \u201csufficient material on which the court can say that there has been a miscarriage of justice\u201d \u2013 should be the touchstone where this court is concerned. In our view, this test captures pithily the essence of the five principles which we have distilled from the foreign cases and set out in the preceding paragraph. Analytically, we see this test as comprising two essential components:\n(a)     The first is the evidential requirement of \u201csufficient material\u201d. The court must be satisfied that the material adduced in support of the application for review is both \u201cnew\u201d and \u201ccompelling\u201d before it will consider the application. If the material presented does not satisfy these two indicia, then the application fails in limine and the inquiry stops there. The burden of production rests on the applicant.\n(b)     The second is the substantive requirement that a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d must have been occasioned. This is the threshold which must be crossed before the court will consider that a concluded criminal appeal ought to be reopened. The burden of proving this likewise rests on the applicant.",
      "47": "We will examine each of these two components in detail below. But, before we do that, we think it important to identify and understand the policy tensions which operate in this area of the law.",
      "48": "The importance of truth in the criminal process is so axiomatic that it almost does not need to be stated. There is \u201csearing injustice and consequential social injury ... when the law turns upon itself and convicts an innocent person\u201d (see Van Der Meer v R (1988) 82 ALR 10 at 31 per Deane J). For this reason, criminal law accords primacy to the determination of the truth. But, the reality, and we do not shy away from admitting this, is that all human institutions are fallible, and any finding made by any court on a contested fact may be imperfect and may not necessarily arrive at the truth (see Lee Chez Kee v PP [2008] 3 SLR(R) 447 at [124]).",
      "49": "That said, this does not mean that society should stand paralysed with indecision, or that every legal finding must be open to continual challenge because of perpetual anxiety over the possibility of an error. The perfect, as they say, cannot be allowed to be the enemy of the good. Finality is also a function of justice. It would be impossible to have a functioning legal system if all legal decisions were open to constant and unceasing challenge, like so many tentative commas appended to the end of an unending sentence. Indeed, in the criminal context, challenges to legal decisions are very likely (and are also likely to be continuous and even interminable), given the inherently severe nature of criminal sanctions and the concomitant desire on the part of accused persons to avoid them as far as they can. The concern here is not just with the saving of valuable judicial resources (vital though that is), but also with the integrity of the judicial process itself. Nothing can be as corrosive of general confidence in the criminal process as an entrenched culture of self-doubt engendered by abusive and repetitive attempts to re-litigate matters which have already been decided.",
      "50": "The tension between truth and finality is a perennial one, and the key, as in so many other things, is balance. We cannot incline so much in favour of one that we neglect the other. As Kirby J observed in Burrell ([37] supra) at [72], \u201cwe can love truth, like all other good things, unwisely; pursue it too keenly; and be willing to pay for it too high a price, so we can also love finality too much\u201d. Truth and finality are both vital, and their competing demands must be held in balance. In The Ampthill Peerage [1976] 2 WLR 777, Lord Wilberforce put it in these terms (at 786H\u2013787B):",
      "51": "The question for us in the present context is whether we have struck the right balance between the prevention of error (which demands some degree of corrigibility) and the according of proper respect to the principle of finality (which necessitates a policy of closure). It is axiomatic that this balance will have to be struck differently at different stages of the criminal process. As we venture further along the criminal process, we must give greater presumptive weight to the veracity of the findings already made and accord greater prominence to the principle of finality. An appeal is an avenue for error correction. For this reason, in an appeal, the decision of the trial court must be examined for error, but due deference must be accorded to that court\u2019s findings, and new evidence cannot be admitted, save in limited circumstances. A review is an avenue for the correction of miscarriages of justice. Thus, it is only in exceptional cases that a matter will be reopened on its merits, and the instances in which the Court of Appeal\u2019s inherent power of review will be exercised must be few and far between.",
      "52": "In our judgment, the principle of finality is no less important in cases involving the death penalty. There is no question that as a modality of punishment, capital punishment is different because of its irreversibility. For this reason, capital cases deserve the most anxious and searching scrutiny. This is also reflected in our laws. Division 1A of Pt XX of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe CPC\u201d) provides that a sentence of death imposed by the High Court has to be reviewed by the Court of Appeal even where no formal appeal has been filed, and the court must be satisfied of the correctness, legality and propriety of both the accused person\u2019s conviction and his sentence before the sentence is carried into effect. But, once the processes of appeal and/or review have run their course, the legal process must recede into the background, and attention must then shift from the legal contest to the search for repose. We do not think it benefits anyone \u2013 not accused persons, not their families nor society at large \u2013 for there to be an endless inquiry into the same facts and the same law with the same raised hopes and dashed expectations that accompany each such fruitless endeavour.",
      "53": "Against this background of competing considerations, we now turn to the first component of the test set out at [44] above for determining when it is appropriate for this court to exercise its inherent power of review \u2013 viz, the evidential requirement of \u201csufficient material\u201d.",
      "54": "When may it be said that there is \u201csufficient material\u201d (which, in this context, encompasses both new factual evidence as well as new legal arguments) to warrant the Court of Appeal exercising its inherent power of review? In our judgment, for the material tendered in support of an application for review to be \u201csufficient\u201d, it must satisfy two cumulative conditions: (a) it must be \u201cnew\u201d; and (b) it must be \u201ccompelling\u201d. Collectively, these conditions form a fine mesh filter that sieves out unmeritorious applications for review while allowing justice to be done in deserving cases. We will examine each condition in turn below.",
      "55": "\u201cNew\u201d material is that which: (a) has hitherto not been considered at any stage of the proceedings leading to the decision under challenge; and (b) could not, even with reasonable diligence, have been adduced in court prior to the filing of the application for review. In adopting this position, we align ourselves with the approach taken in South Australia, where the presence of \u201cfresh\u201d evidence is a jurisdictional precondition that must be satisfied before \u201ca second or subsequent appeal\u201d may be brought (see [39] above and also R v Keogh (No 2) [2014] SASCFC 136 at [98]). The difference is that in our context, we accept that new legal arguments can \u2013 if they satisfy the twofold criteria stated at the outset of this paragraph (viz, of not having been considered at an earlier stage of the proceedings and of being material which could not, even with reasonable diligence, have been presented to the court before the filing of the application for review) \u2013 form the basis for an application for review.",
      "56": "The first limb of the requirement of \u201cnew\u201d material \u2013 viz, that the material must be something which has previously not been considered \u2013 is a corollary of the fact that a review is neither an appeal nor a rehearing. As has been emphasised in many of the cases cited above, the purpose of a review is to correct a miscarriage of justice, and not to allow the applicant a second chance to rehash the same issues in the hope of achieving a different outcome. If the applicant is relying solely on evidence and/or legal arguments that have already been put forward (in the hope that the court will change its mind at the second time of asking), then the application for review, without more, cannot succeed. In order to justify this court\u2019s exercise of its inherent power of review, the material tendered in support of the application must be genuinely novel \u2013 it will not suffice if that material is merely old wine in new wineskins. The applicant cannot merely seek to put a new spin on old evidence which has already been considered by the court or take a new position on material which has already been analysed by the court.",
      "57": "The second limb of the requirement of \u201cnew\u201d material \u2013 viz, that the material must be something which could not, even with reasonable diligence, have been obtained for use prior to the filing of the application for review \u2013 is familiar to us as the Ladd v Marshall [1954] 1 WLR 1489 requirement of \u201cnon-availability\u201d. There are two reasons for this. First, it seems to us that if an accused has of his own volition not called evidence which was available to him and which, bearing in mind his circumstances as an accused (including the fact that he might have been in remand), he could reasonably have been expected to obtain and adduce in court, then there cannot be any basis for saying that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The accused must accept the consequences of his decision as to the calling and treatment of evidence (see Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 517\u2013518 per Barwick CJ). Second, it is in the wider public interest that there be an efficient and economical allocation of court resources. Parties who come before the court (and this includes accused persons) must present all their evidence at the time of the hearing in order that it may be properly weighed and evaluated, instead of introducing their evidence in a piecemeal and haphazard fashion.",
      "58": "At this point, a comparison with applications to admit additional evidence in criminal appeals is instructive. In Soh Meiyun v PP [2014] 3 SLR 299 (\u201cSoh Meiyun\u201d), the High Court favoured a less restrictive approach towards the admission of further evidence in criminal appeals. It stated that an appellate court exercising criminal jurisdiction \u201cshould generally hold that additional evidence which is favourable to the accused person and which fulfils the Ladd v Marshall conditions of relevant and reliability is \u2018necessary\u2019 and admit such evidence on appeal\u201d (at [16]).",
      "59": "There is, however, a crucial difference between the scenario in Soh Meiyun and that in the Present Application \u2013 namely, the former concerned an appeal against a first-instance decision, whereas the Present Application (and other similar applications for review) is a post-appeal application. The wastage of judicial resources that would accompany the reopening of a case which has already been decided on its merits (which the requirement of non-availability is designed to prevent) is therefore concomitantly greater. For this reason, we are of the view that greater stringency is warranted in an application for a review of a concluded criminal appeal, and the requirement of non-availability must be strictly adhered to in respect of such an application.",
      "60": "We appreciate that this means that it will be rare for this court to entertain an application for review which is premised on new legal arguments alone because it will normally be difficult for the applicant in such a case to show that the legal arguments in question could not, even with reasonable diligence, have been raised prior to the filing of the application for a review. It seems to us that in respect of new legal arguments, the criterion of \u201cnon-availability\u201d will ordinarily be satisfied only if the legal arguments concerned are made following a change in the law (for examples of \u201cchange in the law\u201d cases, see Regina v Cottrell [2007] 1 WLR 3262 at [42]\u2013[46] and Regina v Jogee [2016] 2 WLR 681). We also observe that this is the position taken in civil proceedings in relation to the so-called \u201cArnold exception\u201d to issue estoppel (see Arnold v National Westminster Bank plc [1991] 2 AC 93 (\u201cArnold\u201d)). In Arnold, Lord Keith of Kinkel held that there should be an exception to issue estoppel \u201cin the special circumstance that there has become available to a party further material relevant to the correct determination of a point involved in the earlier proceedings\u201d, provided that the further material in question \u201ccould not by reasonable diligence have been adduced in those [earlier] proceedings\u201d (at 109B). As we emphasised in TT International ([1] supra) at [189] and [190(c)], the \u201cfurther material\u201d in question must be material which shows that \u201cthe error in the court\u2019s decision stemmed from some point of fact or law relevant to the decision [which] was not taken or argued before the court which made that decision and could not reasonably have been taken or argued on that occasion\u201d [emphasis in original]. In Arnold, the \u201cfurther material\u201d consisted of subsequent judicial decisions which, Lord Keith held, could \u201cnot inappositely be described as a change in the law\u201d (see Arnold at 109C).",
      "61": "\u201cCompelling\u201d material is that which is reliable, substantial and powerfully probative; it must be capable of showing almost conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice (see [31] and [39] above). The threshold is a high one. In Yong Vui Kong (Jurisdiction) ([15] supra), Chan CJ gave the following examples of the kind of material which he considered might justify the exceptional recourse of a review (at [14]):",
      "62": "There are two dimensions to the requirement that the material in question must be \u201ccompelling\u201d. First, the material must be \u201creliable\u201d in the sense that it possesses a high degree of cogency, and is credible and trustworthy in respect of the matters to which it pertains. It is notable that all the examples given by Chan CJ in Yong Vui Kong (Jurisdiction) at [14]\u2013[15] related to material of an objective character: eg, DNA evidence, documentary evidence or a new line of authorities. The reason for this is that objective evidence is quintessentially reliable since, in general, it may be independently verified and is based on facts which may be apprehended by analysis, measurement and observation. While we would not go so far as to dogmatically exclude all subjective evidence, we would imagine that such evidence would not ordinarily suffice to show \u201calmost conclusively\u201d that a miscarriage of justice has been occasioned. Thus, evidence from witnesses who have taken the stand, particularly that of co-accused persons who now seek to resile from their earlier testimony (see, eg, Abdullah ([10] supra)), cannot in itself be considered \u201creliable\u201d evidence unless it is substantiated by other objective evidence.",
      "63": "The second dimension of the requirement of \u201ccompelling\u201d material is that the material in question must be \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201cpowerfully probative\u201d in the sense that it is logically relevant to the precise issues which are in dispute. The mere fact that material is reliable does not necessarily mean that it is relevant. For example, the presence of a person\u2019s DNA on an object is almost conclusive evidence of the fact that that person touched the object. However, that piece of information might be of little or no utility in determining whether that person committed the crime in question. This applies with even greater force to new lines of legal argument. The imposition of criminal punishment almost invariably involves the deprivation of life and liberty, and therefore, by definition, Art 9(1) of the Constitution, which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law\u201d, is tangentially involved in all criminal cases. But, it does not follow that Art 9(1) will be relevant in every criminal case. Much will depend on the precise issues which fall to be decided on the facts of the case.",
      "64": "At the end of the day, the inquiry into whether the material tendered in support of an application for review is \u201ccompelling\u201d is directed towards the quality of the material presented as assessed against the precise issues in dispute. A useful summative question is whether, taken as a whole, the material is capable of showing \u201calmost conclusively\u201d that there has been a miscarriage of justice, and is therefore \u201ccompelling\u201d enough to warrant the exercise of the Court of Appeal\u2019s inherent power of review. This is a question of fact which calls for an exercise of judgment of the kind that judges are called on to perform on an almost daily basis.",
      "65": "We turn now to the substantive requirement that a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d must have been occasioned (see [44(b)] above). The expression \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d is one of those protean expressions that is incapable of an exhaustive and stipulative definition. At its core, it connotes that there must be a manifest error and/or an egregious violation of a principle of law or procedure which strikes at the very heart of the decision under challenge and robs it of its character as a reasoned judicial decision. Based on our survey of the cases, a miscarriage of justice is chiefly (but not exclusively) to be found in one of the following two situations:\n(a)     The first is where a decision on conviction or sentence is \u201cdemonstrably wrong\u201d. In this regard, it is not sufficient to show that there is a real possibility that the decision is wrong; instead, it must be shown that there is a powerful probability that it is wrong. Generally, this plea may be raised only by the accused and not by the Prosecution, save in an exceptional case where the Prosecution has uncovered material new evidence which it seeks to rely on to set aside an unsafe conviction or an excessive sentence premised on a fundamental misapprehension of the applicable law or facts.\n(b)     The second situation is where there has been fraud or a breach of natural justice. This arises where, in the words of Dame Elizabeth in Uddin ([29] supra) at [18], there has been a \u201ccorruption of justice\u201d [emphasis in original], such that the integrity of the judicial proceedings itself has been impugned. An application for a review on this ground is available to both the Prosecution and the accused.",
      "66": "We will discuss each of these situations in turn below.",
      "67": "There is no doubt that the conviction of an innocent person is an injustice \u2013 perhaps the ultimate substantive injustice, proof of which would justify reopening a concluded criminal appeal. However, as we have discussed at [46]\u2013[48] above, absolute certitude is never available. This is so even in the case of DNA evidence, the utility of which is highly context-specific. The question, therefore, is: how certain does the court have to be that its previous decision (be it on conviction or sentence) is wrong before it decides to reopen a matter? In Yong Vui Kong (Jurisdiction) ([15] supra) at [14], Chan CJ opined that an appropriate test was whether the decision in question was \u201cdemonstrably found to be wrong\u201d [emphasis added].",
      "68": "In our judgment, where the decision under challenge is a decision on conviction, it is not sufficient to show that there is a real possibility that the decision is wrong. Instead, it must be shown, based on the material tendered in support of the application for review alone and without the need for further inquiry, that there is a powerful probability that the decision concerned is wrong. There are two reasons for this rigorous standard. First, the higher standard properly distinguishes the function of an appeal, which is a means for the correction of error, from that of a review, which is about the protection of the integrity of the judicial process. This point was amply made in Uddin and Asean Security Paper Mills ([41] supra). Second, it would better vindicate the importance of the principle of finality by allowing intervention only in truly exceptional cases. This approach accords due recognition to the fact that the decision under challenge has already undergone at least two rounds of separate and independent scrutiny \u2013 once by the court exercising original criminal jurisdiction and another by the Court of Appeal in its appellate capacity \u2013 and these courts\u2019 findings must be given great presumptive weight. Such findings should only be displaced where they can be proved to be \u201cdemonstrably wrong\u201d.",
      "69": "Where the decision under challenge is a decision on sentence, given that sentencing involves an exercise of discretion, it will be even more difficult for the applicant to demonstrate that the decision concerned is \u201cdemonstrably wrong\u201d. It would not be sufficient for the applicant merely to allege that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive, or that the court failed to appreciate the material before it, or even that the court relied on the wrong test or the wrong precedent. These are the standards for intervention applicable to an appeal (see PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (\u201cMohammed Liton\u201d) at [82]). In our judgment, in order for a decision on sentence to be considered \u201cdemonstrably wrong\u201d, the applicant would have to show that: (a) the decision was based on some fundamental misapprehension of the law or the facts, thereby resulting in a decision that can, without exaggeration, be described as blatantly wrong; and (b) the error must be plain on the face of the record. We venture to think that instances of this nature will be exceedingly rare. It may occur, for example, where the court imposed a sentence in excess of its sentencing jurisdiction (see, eg, PP v Louis Pius Gilbert [2003] 3 SLR(R) 418), where it failed to impose the statutorily-prescribed punishment (see, eg, PP v Loo Kun Long [2003] 1 SLR(R) 28) or, conversely, where it imposed a sentence above the statutorily-prescribed maximum (see, eg, Chiaw Wai Onn v PP [1997] 2 SLR(R) 233).",
      "70": "An application for a review on the ground that a decision, whether on conviction or sentence, is \u201cdemonstrably wrong\u201d is usually available only to the accused and not to the Prosecution (see [63(a)] above). This is because when the State prosecutes a criminal matter, it wields an awesome power. Therefore, it has concomitant interests and duties which are not simply those borne by an ordinary litigant (see TT International ([1] supra) at [128]). One corollary of this is that once a person has been acquitted of an offence, the doctrine of autrefois acquit prevents him from being tried again for the same offence (see Art 11(2) of the Constitution). The purpose of this doctrine is to protect individuals from oppression, and to allow accused persons who have had their cases disposed of to move on with their lives without fear that they will once again be subject to the machinery of criminal justice in respect of the same offence (see Regina v Humphrys [1976] 2 WLR 857 at 877B per Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone). In our judgment, this principle is equally applicable to an application for a review even though, strictly speaking, no \u201cretrial\u201d might be involved. Thus, even if the Prosecution is of the view that an acquittal is unjustified or that a sentence, being based on a fundamental misapprehension of the law or the facts, is unjustifiably lenient, it would still be absolutely precluded from applying for a review of the decision.",
      "71": "Conversely, however, if the Prosecution elects to bring an application for a review in the accused\u2019s favour (eg, to set aside an unsafe conviction or an excessive sentence premised on a fundamental misapprehension of the applicable law or facts), then it would not be precluded from doing so. As the High Court observed (albeit in a slightly different context) in PP v Lim Choon Teck [2015] 5 SLR 1395, the Public Prosecutor has a crucial role to play in the fair and impartial administration of criminal justice. To this end, it should be able to correct egregious errors in the judicial process by bringing the appropriate applications for review where necessary.",
      "72": "Where the decision under challenge has been tainted by fraud or a breach of natural justice which has an adverse effect on the accused, that alone \u2013 even in the absence of proof that the decision is \u201cdemonstrably wrong\u201d \u2013 would usually suffice to establish that a miscarriage of justice has been occasioned. This was the position in England even pre-Taylor (see [26] above), and it is also the position taken in all the jurisdictions which we surveyed. We give three illustrative examples below:\n(a)     In R v Daniel ([26] supra), the applicant pleaded guilty to burglary and was sentenced to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. Before a sole judge, he sought leave to appeal against his sentence out of time, but was unsuccessful. He then renewed his application for leave to appeal, this time before the Full Court, and engaged counsel for this purpose. However, due to an administrative oversight, his counsel were not informed of the hearing, and the English Court of Appeal heard and dismissed his leave application in the absence of counsel. When this oversight was discovered, counsel sought to have the application re-listed for hearing. However, the English Court of Appeal, holding itself to be functus officio, dismissed the application. The Secretary of State then intervened and referred the matter back to the English Court of Appeal for a rehearing pursuant to the powers given to him under s 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (c 19) (UK). At the restored hearing of the application for leave to appeal, the court acknowledged that it had initially acted per incuriam in holding that it had no jurisdiction to rehear the matter, but stressed that even in such a case, a matter would be re-listed for hearing only if it could be shown that there was a likelihood of injustice.\n(b)     In Ramanathan a/l Chelliah v Public Prosecutor [2009] 6 MLJ 215, the applicant was convicted by the trial court of two counts of outraging the modesty of the victim. His conviction was later quashed by the Malaysian High Court on two grounds: excessive delay on the part of the trial court in rendering written reasons, and an error of law on the applicable standard of proof. The Prosecution appealed to the Malaysian Court of Appeal and only those two points were argued. The court agreed with the Prosecution and, without first giving the applicant an opportunity to resist the appeal, reinstated the conviction. On an application for a review, a differently-constituted Malaysian Court of Appeal held that the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing had been violated and ordered that the appeal be reheard.\n(c)     In Regina v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No 2) [1999] 2 WLR 272, the House of Lords set aside one of its own decisions on the ground of apparent bias. The applicant, a former head of state, had been arrested pursuant to international warrants which alleged the commission of various crimes against humanity. When the matter came before the House of Lords for the first time, the validity of the international arrest warrants was upheld despite the argument that the applicant enjoyed sovereign immunity. Subsequently, it transpired that one of the law lords in the panel had links with a party involved in the proceedings. That factor alone \u2013 even in the absence of any indication of actual bias \u2013 was held to be a sufficient basis for a rehearing to be ordered.",
      "73": "An application for a review on the ground of fraud or breach of natural justice is available to both the Prosecution and the accused (see [63(b)] above) because of the wider public interest considerations involved. Where a decision in an individual criminal case is wrong, the impact on the public interest is comparatively limited. Consequently, the public interest in the reopening of the case (even where the decision might arguably be \u201cdemonstrably wrong\u201d) is outweighed by the policy considerations in favour of finality in litigation, as well as the compelling interest in protecting an accused person from double prosecution. However, where considerations of fraud or natural justice are involved, public confidence in the integrity of the very criminal justice process itself is at stake, and this suffices to outweigh the considerations of finality and the protection of an accused from double prosecution.",
      "74": "This does not necessarily mean, however, that the court will treat an application for a review from the Prosecution in the same manner as it does an application from an accused person: ie, that the application will be granted almost as a matter of course. On this point, a comparison between Yasain ([32] supra) and Hall ([35] supra) is instructive.",
      "75": "In Yasain, the accused had earlier been convicted of a number of offences including rape and kidnapping. The sentences imposed for the rape charge (six years) and the kidnapping charge (one and a half years) had been ordered to run consecutively, making a cumulative sentence of seven and a half years\u2019 imprisonment. When the accused appealed, it was noticed that no verdict had been recorded in respect of the kidnapping charge even though the accused had been sentenced on it. The English Court of Appeal therefore ordered that the conviction in respect of the kidnapping charge be expunged. Subsequently, it was discovered that a verdict on the kidnapping charge had in fact been returned by the jury, but had not been recorded because of an error. The Prosecution then applied for the court to reopen the appeal and reinstate the accused\u2019s conviction and sentence in respect of the kidnapping charge. The application was allowed because the error had resulted in an unwarranted 18-month reduction in the accused\u2019s sentence. The court observed that what had taken place was the product of \u201ca rare coincidence of circumstances\u201d, and that the \u201cvery substantial public interest in those properly convicted serving the sentence imposed\u201d justified the extraordinary recourse of reopening the appeal (at [49]).",
      "76": "By contrast, in Hall, it will be recalled that the accused had already been sentenced to nearly seven years\u2019 imprisonment for perverting the course of justice, whereas the sentence which he had received for assaulting prison officers, which had been set aside because of the fraud that he perpetrated, was only six months\u2019 imprisonment (see [35]\u2013[36] above). The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal noted that should the appeal pertaining to the accused\u2019s common assault conviction be reopened, much time and resources would have to be devoted to its disposal. The court concluded that such an expenditure of resources would not be justified, given that the interests of justice had already been served by the imposition of a separate and lengthy custodial sentence on the accused for perverting the course of justice, and thus, there was no need to reopen the appeal. It seems to us that the reason given by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal for not reopening the appeal makes good practical sense. That said, we have not heard the Public Prosecutor on this question as the issue did not arise in the present case, and we therefore express no concluded view on it.",
      "77": "As a final point before we conclude our discussion of when it is appropriate for the Court of Appeal to reopen its decision in a concluded criminal appeal, we think it is important to clarify this court\u2019s earlier comments in Ramalingam ([20] supra at [17]) and Quek Hock Lye ([20] supra at [23]\u2013[24]) that the criminal motions in those cases were heard because they concerned new legal arguments involving constitutional points in relation to capital offences. In our judgment, Ramalingam and Quek Hock Lye should be confined to their facts. Both were cases in which this court saw the need to clarify important legal points in the public interest. These two cases should not be interpreted to mean that there is an automatic right of review whenever new legal arguments involving constitutional points are raised in a capital case. Indeed, it is evident that in Ramalingam, this court did not think that the raising of new legal arguments involving constitutional points was in itself a sufficient ground for a review. At [16], it noted that the applicant had had ample opportunity to raise, at an earlier stage, the constitutional points which he now sought to advance in his application for review, and therefore \u201ccould have had no cause to complain if we had declined to hear this Motion on the basis that he had exhausted all his rights to due process ...\u201d [emphasis added]. We would clarify that the touchstone, at the end of the day, is still whether the applicant has produced sufficient material upon which the court may conclude that there has been a miscarriage of justice. For the purposes of determining if this test has been satisfied, it does not matter, where the material relied on consists of new legal arguments, whether or not those legal arguments involve constitutional points \u2013 the same criteria still apply.",
      "78": "This can be seen most clearly in Yong Vui Kong (Prosecutorial Discretion) ([20] supra). The issue in that case was whether the applicant\u2019s constitutional right to equal treatment had been violated by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s decision to charge him but not one \u201cChia\u201d, who was alleged to be the kingpin of the drug syndicate for which the applicant worked. (Chia was detained under the provisions of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67, 2000 Rev Ed) instead.) The applicant argued, on the basis of the principles articulated in Ramalingam (which was decided just two weeks prior to the filing of his application for review), that the Court of Appeal should reopen its decision on his conviction and sentence (in Yong Vui Kong v PP [2010] 3 SLR 489). In explaining why it decided to reconsider the matter even though no novel constitutional points were involved, the court said that the case presented itself as a more compelling instance in which there might have been unequal treatment since Chia \u201cappear[ed] to be a more culpable offender than [the applicant]\u201d (see Yong Vui Kong (Prosecutorial Discretion) at [19]). Further, the court noted that the issue of possible unequal treatment was one which had arisen solely as a result of its decision in Ramalingam, and therefore, the argument was \u201cnew\u201d both in the sense that it had hitherto never been considered before the filing of the application for review and could not, even with reasonable diligence, have been raised in court prior to that (see likewise Yong Vui Kong (Prosecutorial Discretion) at [19]). Thus presented, it can be seen that the court applied the usual criteria (viz, the production of sufficient material to establish that there has been a miscarriage of justice) in deciding whether to entertain the application, even though the material relied on by the applicant consisted of new legal arguments involving constitutional points.",
      "79": "To reiterate, the raising of hitherto unconsidered points of constitutional law is not in itself sufficient to show that the Court of Appeal ought to review a concluded criminal appeal. Much would depend on the merits of the constitutional points concerned and whether they would, having regard to the factual context of the case in question, affect the outcome of the case and thus show that a miscarriage of justice has been occasioned. We would reiterate that litigants who pray in aid of the Court of Appeal\u2019s inherent power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal must show that there is sufficient material upon which it may be concluded that there has been a miscarriage of justice.",
      "80": "This concludes our discussion on the law relating to the Court of Appeal\u2019s inherent power of review. From this, the following key propositions can be distilled:\n(a)     The Court of Appeal, as the final appellate court in Singapore, has the inherent power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice. This power is a facet of the judicial power which is vested in the Court of Appeal by virtue of Art 93 of the Constitution. When the court exercises this power of review, it is acting within the scope of its statutorily-conferred appellate jurisdiction, which is not completely exhausted merely by the rendering of a decision on the merits of the appeal.\n(b)     A review of a concluded criminal appeal is not to be confused with an appeal. In reviewing a case, the Court of Appeal is primarily concerned not with the correctness of the decision under review, but with the question of whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. To justify the exercise of the court\u2019s inherent power of review, the applicant must satisfy the court that there is sufficient material on which it may conclude that there has been a miscarriage of justice. In this regard, the mere fact that the material relied on by the applicant consists of new legal arguments involving constitutional points does not, without more, suffice.\n(c)     In deciding whether to exercise its inherent power of review, the Court of Appeal will consider the following two matters (as set out at sub-paras (d) and (e) below).\n(d)     The first is whether the applicant has discharged his burden of producing \u201csufficient material\u201d to warrant the court exercising its inherent power of review. The material put forward must possess two signal features in order to be considered \u201csufficient\u201d: (i) it must be \u201cnew\u201d \u2013 ie, it must not previously have been canvassed at any stage of the proceedings prior to the filing of the application for review, and it must be something which could not, even with reasonable diligence, have been adduced in court earlier; and (ii) it must be \u201ccompelling\u201d \u2013 ie, it must be reliable, substantial, powerfully probative, and therefore, capable of showing almost conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice.\n(e)     The second condition is whether the applicant has discharged his burden of proving that there has been a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d. Generally, the court will only find that there has been a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d in one of the following two situations:\n(i)       The first is where a decision of the court on conviction or sentence is shown to be \u201cdemonstrably wrong\u201d. In relation to a decision on conviction, it is not sufficient for the applicant to show that there is a real possibility that the decision concerned is wrong; instead, it must be apparent, based on the evidence tendered in support of the application alone and without the need for further inquiry, that there is a powerful probability that the decision is wrong. In relation to a decision on sentence, it must be shown that the decision under challenge was based on some fundamental misapprehension of the law or the facts, thereby resulting in a decision that is blatantly wrong on the face of the record. An application for a review on the ground that a decision (whether on conviction or sentence) is \u201cdemonstrably wrong\u201d is usually available only to the accused.\n(ii)       The second scenario is where the decision under challenge is tainted by fraud or a breach of natural justice, such that the integrity of the judicial process is compromised. An application for a review on the ground of fraud or breach of natural justice is available to both the accused and the Prosecution.",
      "81": "In our judgment, applying the legal principles which we have just outlined to the Present Application, this application is misconceived in principle and must fail. For the most part, the Applicant merely traverses the same grounds as those which he covered in his submissions before this court at the hearing of CA (Re-sentencing) ([4] supra). There is very little in the way of \u201cnew\u201d material, let alone material which is \u201ccompelling\u201d and which justifies the exceptional recourse of a review. The Applicant has never suggested that there was any fraud, and in his amended notice of motion, the allegation that there was a breach of natural justice has been dropped. It has always been his core case in the Present Application that this court\u2019s decision in CA (Re-sentencing) was wrong; but, as will be plain from our analysis of the evidence, he fell short of showing that the sentence which this court imposed was \u201cwrong\u201d, let alone \u201cdemonstrably wrong\u201d. In truth, the Present Application is not a genuine application for a review, but an attempt to re-litigate a matter which had already been fully argued and thoroughly considered.",
      "82": "Given the acute importance of this case to the Applicant and his family, and because this is the first time we have articulated the principles governing the exercise of the Court of Appeal\u2019s inherent power of review, we propose to examine the material which the Applicant has put forward in some detail. However, we must clarify that, moving forward, such a detailed analysis will not be appropriate in every application for review, particularly where it is clear that the application is plainly without merit. We are doing so in this case only for illustrative purposes.",
      "83": "In his submissions, counsel for the Applicant, Mr Mohan, has laid out a number of \u201cgrounds\u201d in support of his argument that there is a need for this court to exercise its inherent power to reopen its decision in CA (Re-sentencing). For ease of exposition, we will refer to each of these \u201cgrounds\u201d as \u201cGround 1\u201d, \u201cGround 2\u201d, and so on. As there is some degree of overlap in the various \u201cgrounds\u201d, we have merged and reorganised them into four principal contentions. Broadly summarised, Mr Mohan argues that this court\u2019s decision in CA (Re-sentencing):\n(a)     was premised on an error of law;\n(b)     was based on the wrong factual premise;\n(c)     breached the requirement of unanimity; and\n(d)     breached the Applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial.",
      "84": "We will deal with each of these principal contentions in turn below.",
      "85": "Mr Mohan\u2019s first principal contention, which embraces Grounds 1, 2, 6 and 7 of his submissions, is that this court erred in law in sentencing the Applicant to death. As a preliminary point, Mr Mohan first argues that the Prosecution has no right of appeal against a sentence of life imprisonment and caning imposed by the High Court (in lieu of a sentence of death) pursuant to an application for re-sentencing under the 2012 Amendment Act, and for that reason, this court acted without jurisdiction in CA (Re-sentencing) when we substituted the death sentence in place of the sentence of life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane imposed by the Re-sentencing Judge. Apart from this jurisdictional argument, Mr Mohan also submits that this court\u2019s decision was wrong in law for the following reasons:\n(a)     There was no basis for appellate intervention in CA (Re-sentencing) because the sentence imposed by the Re-sentencing Judge was not manifestly inadequate.\n(b)     The test applied by this court to decide whether a sentence of death should be imposed \u2013 viz, whether the actions of the offender would \u201coutrage the feelings of the community\u201d (also referred to hereafter as \u201cthe CA (Re-sentencing) test\u201d where the context so warrants) \u2013 is not appropriate for the offence of murder. In relation to this offence, Parliament\u2019s intention is that a wide ambit of considerations, and not only those relating to the circumstances of the offence, should be taken into account to determine the appropriate sentence.\n(c)     The imposition of a sentence of death offends the principle of consistency since there are cases, both decided before and after CA (Re-sentencing), which are more serious than the Applicant\u2019s case, but which did not attract the death penalty.",
      "86": "It is important to remember that CA (Re-sentencing) was the Prosecution\u2019s appeal against sentence. Therefore, based on the principles we have articulated above, in order for a review to lie, the Applicant needs to show that this court\u2019s decision in that appeal was based on a \u201cfundamental misapprehension\u201d of the applicable law or facts and was therefore \u201cblatantly wrong\u201d. Of all the arguments raised by Mr Mohan in support of his first principal contention, the only one that could conceivably satisfy this standard is the argument that this court acted without jurisdiction in CA (Re-sentencing) because the Prosecution had no right of appeal against the decision in HC (Re-sentencing) ([4] supra). In our judgment, however, this argument is plainly without merit. The relevant provisions of s 4(5) of the 2012 Amendment Act in this regard read as follows:",
      "87": "Division 1 of Pt XX of the CPC relates to appeals, and s 374(3), which falls within it, states that the Public Prosecutor may appeal against \u201cthe acquittal of an accused or the sentence imposed on an accused or an order of the trial court\u201d [emphasis added]. The purport of s 4(5)(h) of the 2012 Amendment Act (read with Div 1 of Pt XX of the CPC) is that the sentence passed by the High Court upon an application for re-sentencing is to be treated as if it were the sentence originally passed by the High Court following the accused person\u2019s trial. Such a decision is undoubtedly appealable, and there is nothing in either the 2012 Amendment Act or the CPC which indicates that the decision is final and non-appealable. The Public Prosecutor submitted \u2013 and we agree \u2013 that it is plain and obvious that the High Court\u2019s decision in a re-sentencing application is to be treated like any other sentencing decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction, and is therefore appealable to this court. In light of the foregoing, we hold that this court did have the jurisdiction to hear CA (Re-sentencing).",
      "88": "The remaining errors of law which the Applicant alleged had occurred do not really warrant any serious consideration and do not even come close to establishing that this court committed a blatant error in CA (Re-sentencing). This alone is sufficient to dispose of Mr Mohan\u2019s first principal contention; but, for completeness, we will go on to discuss briefly below each of the \u201cgrounds\u201d which Mr Mohan has advanced under this particular contention.",
      "89": "In Mohammed Liton ([66] supra) at [81]\u2013[82], we explained that appellate courts would intervene to correct sentences in one of the following four situations:\n(a)     where the sentencing judge erred in respect of the proper factual basis for the sentence;\n(b)     where the sentencing judge failed to appreciate the material before him;\n(c)     where the sentence was wrong in principle; or\n(d)     where the sentence was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate.",
      "90": "Mr Mohan\u2019s submission that \u201cthe Court of Appeal can only increase the sentence where the original penalty imposed was manifestly inadequate\u201d [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics] is therefore clearly incorrect.",
      "91": "This court\u2019s decision in CA (Re-sentencing) ([4] supra) is justifiable on at least two of the four aforementioned bases for appellate intervention. First, it may be said that the Re-sentencing Judge erred in respect of the proper factual basis for the sentence. At [58]\u2013[59] of CA (Re-sentencing), the majority of this court noted that the Re-sentencing Judge erred in holding that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the Applicant had approached the deceased from behind. That the Applicant had indeed done so was a finding which the minority accepted as well (see CA (Re-sentencing) at [91]\u2013[103]). Second, it may be said that the Re-sentencing Judge erred on a matter of principle. The cases of Sia Ah Kew v PP [1974\u20131976] SLR(R) 54 and Panya Martmontree v PP [1995] 2 SLR(R) 806 were both cited to him (see HC (Re-sentencing) at [13]\u2013[14]), but he did not adopt the test articulated therein: viz, that a sentence of death would be appropriate where the offence outraged the feelings of the community. In CA (Re-sentencing), this court unanimously adopted that test as the correct legal test for determining whether it would be appropriate to impose the death sentence for the offence of murder. Accordingly, the Re-sentencing Judge\u2019s decision was erroneous as a matter of principle.",
      "92": "Before us, Mr Mohan argued impassionedly that the test which this court unanimously endorsed and applied in CA (Re-sentencing) in determining whether the Applicant ought to be sentenced to death \u2013 viz, whether his actions \u201coutrage the feelings of the community\u201d (at [44], [86] and [203]) \u2013 was wrong. According to Mr Mohan, this test should be confined in its application to only the offence of kidnapping, in respect of which it was originally promulgated. He submits that it is too blunt a test in the context of the offence of murder because all instances of murder, by definition, involve violence and result in death, and are bound to outrage the feelings of the community. Thus, to apply this test to the offence of murder would be to consign all persons convicted of murder to death. Mr Mohan also criticises this test for its inflexibility, arguing that it permits the sentencing court to consider only the manner in which the offence was committed, but not the accused\u2019s motives or concerns of general deterrence. In lieu of this test, Mr Mohan suggests, we should adopt the position taken by the Indian Supreme Court and the courts of some of the Caribbean States: viz, that the death penalty should be reserved for cases which are the \u201crarest of the rare\u201d.",
      "93": "In our view, this argument does not even begin to get off the ground. The points made by Mr Mohan, including the Indian and the Caribbean authorities to which he referred, had been considered extensively by this court in CA (Re-sentencing) (at [38]\u2013[43]) and are clearly not \u201cnew\u201d. This court had carefully reviewed those points and those authorities, and had given reasons for rejecting the Indian and the Caribbean approach. We do not propose to reprise the analysis here.",
      "94": "More troubling, however, is the fact that Mr Mohan appears to have completely misunderstood what the test of whether the offender\u2019s actions \u201coutrage the feelings of the community\u201d involves. This test does not entail that the court is to sentence by public opinion, with the sentence of death being imposed for the offence of murder whenever a preponderance of the members of the public express sufficient distaste for the accused\u2019s actions. We completely abjure such a suggestion. That is not the way this court or, for that matter, any court elsewhere would administer justice. The test that this court adopted in CA (Re-sentencing) sets out, instead, a reasoned normative standard which future courts are to apply when deciding whether to impose the death penalty for the offence of murder. At [44], this court said:",
      "95": "Determining whether an offender\u2019s actions so \u201coutrage the feelings of the community\u201d and are \u201cso grievous an affront to humanity and so abhorrent\u201d that the death penalty is justified is an exercise in ethical judgment in which the sentencing court expresses the collective conscience of the community through the selection of a condign punishment. In performing this exercise, contrary to what Mr Mohan submitted, the remit of the sentencing court\u2019s inquiry is not circumscribed. This court specifically stated in CA (Re-sentencing) that the sentencing court was to look widely, and that \u201call the circumstances and factors of the case must be taken into consideration in meting out an appropriate sentence\u201d [emphasis added] (at [37]), thus also ensuring that the inquiry would be an objective one. Furthermore, at [51(d)], this court expressly highlighted that \u201cthe motive and intention of the offender at the time he committed the offence\u201d was an important sentencing factor which must form part of the sentencing matrix. In the circumstances, we see no warrantable basis for concluding that this court applied the wrong test in CA (Re-sentencing).",
      "96": "In support of his argument based on inconsistency in sentencing (see [81(c)] above), Mr Mohan tendered a diagram in which he arranged five cases in ascending orders of severity. These cases are: PP v Kamrul Hasan Abdul Quddus [2014] SGHC 4, PP v Gopinathan Nair Remadevi Bijukumar [2012] SGHC 59, PP v Ellarry bin Puling [2011] SGHC 214, PP v Wang Wenfeng [2014] 2 SLR 636 and PP v Micheal Anak Garing [2015] SGHC 107 (\u201cMicheal Garing\u201d) (a case involving two offenders). Of the six offenders sentenced in these five cases, only one received the death penalty; the rest received terms of life imprisonment and between ten and 24 strokes of the cane. Mr Mohan argued that the Applicant\u2019s case was less serious than two others in which the death penalty was not imposed, and was therefore not one which should attract the death penalty.",
      "97": "The material which Mr Mohan relied on is not new. All the cases mentioned in the preceding paragraph, save for Micheal Garing, which was decided only after CA (Re-sentencing) ([4] supra), had already been cited to this court in argument at the hearing of CA (Re-sentencing) and were fully considered. We will not delve into the details of these cases, save to say that they do not give us any further reasons to conclude that this court\u2019s decision to impose the sentence of death in CA (Re-sentencing) was, on the basis of the principle of consistency in sentencing, \u201cblatantly wrong\u201d. By its very nature, sentencing is a fact-sensitive exercise in judicial discretion which involves balancing a myriad of considerations (see Mohammed Liton ([66] supra) at [81]). To arrange cases along a \u201cspectrum\u201d necessarily involves making a value judgment on the importance of some factors vis-\u00e0-vis others. This is an exercise in respect of which even reasonable persons may differ. For this reason, it would ordinarily be very difficult to demonstrate that a sentencing decision is \u201cblatantly wrong\u201d on the basis of inconsistency alone, and we certainly do not think that such an argument can sensibly be maintained in the present case, given that this court had already considered the aforesaid precedent cases (except for Micheal Garing).",
      "98": "Mr Mohan\u2019s second principal contention, which comprises Grounds 3, 4 and 5 of his submissions, is that this court erred in imposing the sentence of death in CA (Re-sentencing) as it based its decision on incorrect findings of fact. The thrust of Mr Mohan\u2019s argument in this regard is that the majority erred in relying on the findings made in CA (Conviction) ([3] supra) \u2013 which, he submits, are open to serious question \u2013 to hold that the Applicant assaulted the deceased multiple times from the back. Mr Mohan argues that the question of whether the Applicant struck the deceased at least three times from the back is critical because the sentence of death would not be justified if it cannot be proved that the Applicant was the one who caused the majority of the deceased\u2019s skull fractures. He contends that the proper interpretation of the evidence is that \u201cthere were at least 2 blows caused by the Applicant (one sufficient to fracture the skull), however, there could have been more\u201d [emphasis in original].",
      "99": "In our judgment, this argument is a non-starter because the point is not new, and had already been thoroughly considered and analysed in CA (Re-sentencing). But, before we explain our reasons for rejecting this argument, we think it is necessary to address an important preliminary point. This concerns Mr Mohan\u2019s contention that at the hearing of CA (Re-sentencing), this court ought, of its own motion, to have remitted the matter to the High Court for further evidence to be taken at a Newton hearing (see R v Robert John Newton (1982) 4 Cr App R (S) 388) in order to clarify the alleged \u201cambiguities\u201d relating to the manner in which the Applicant attacked the deceased. Mr Mohan argues that a Newton hearing was necessary because the sentence of death which this court imposed in CA (Re-sentencing) was premised on an assessment of the Applicant\u2019s culpability made on the basis of facts which the Applicant did not have an adequate opportunity to challenge either at first instance (in HC (Conviction) ([3] supra)) or on appeal (in CA (Conviction)) as those facts were not relevant then since the death penalty was mandatory for the offence of murder at the time.",
      "100": "We think it is important to set the record straight. The short answer to the question as to why this court did not, in CA (Re-sentencing), order a Newton hearing to be convened is simply this: the Applicant elected not to lead further evidence. Before the Re-sentencing Judge, the Applicant (through his then counsel, Mr Anand Nalachandran and Mr Josephus Tan) consistently maintained that he did not think further evidence needed to be led, nor did he wish to make the requisite application to do so. The following two exchanges took place during the hearing of the Applicant\u2019s re-sentencing application. The first exchange was between Mr Nalachandran and the Re-sentencing Judge:",
      "101": "The second exchange was between Mr Tan and the Re-sentencing Judge:",
      "102": "Mr Mohan\u2019s submission that the two exchanges quoted above on the leading of further evidence concerned only the question of whether the Applicant was intoxicated at the time he attacked the deceased is incorrect. As is clear from the first extract, the fact in issue during the first exchange was the exact sequence of events relating to the assault, and it was in relation to that precise question that the Applicant\u2019s then counsel accepted that he was limited by the findings which had already been made by the High Court in HC (Conviction) and by the Court of Appeal in CA (Conviction). While it is true that the second exchange took place in relation to the defence of intoxication, read in context, it is clear that the Applicant\u2019s then counsel accepted that he was bound by the findings made in CA (Conviction), and therefore, as a general point, did not seek to introduce further evidence. Of course, it was always open to the Applicant to change his mind when the Prosecution appealed against the Re-sentencing Judge\u2019s decision, and he could have ma"

The Appellant then appealed against the conviction and sentence and this court dismissed the appeal in April 2011. On 25 July 2011, the Appellant also submitted a petition for clemency to the President, which was rejected.",
      "2": "Subsequently, on 14 November 2012, the Singapore Parliament passed the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 30 of 2012) which introduced the new s 33B into the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cMDA\u201d). We set out the relevant provisions of s 33B of the MDA (\u201cs 33B\u201d) below:",
      "3": "The enactment of s 33B, in particular s 33B(2), led the Appellant to commence Criminal Motion No 17 of 2015 (\u201cCM 17/2015\u201d) where he sought a re-sentencing on the basis that he fulfilled the requirements stated therein. In short, s 33B(2) of the MDA (\u201cs 33B(2)\u201d) read with s 33B(1)(a) of the same allows the court to sentence a convicted drug trafficker to life imprisonment instead of the death penalty if he proves on a balance of probabilities that: (a) his involvement in the offence was limited to that stated in s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA (ie, he was merely a \u201ccourier\u201d); and (b) if the Public Prosecutor issues a certificate to affirm that he has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau (\u201cCNB\u201d) in disrupting drug activities. In Rosman bin Abdullah v PP [2015] SGHC 287 (\u201cthe GD\u201d), the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) held that the Appellant had not fulfilled the two requirements, and therefore affirmed the death sentence which he had imposed on the Appellant earlier at the trial. The present appeal is an appeal against this particular decision.",
      "4": "Before proceeding to set out the relevant background, it would be appropriate to note a couple of (significant) preliminary points that were raised.",
      "5": "The first preliminary point relates to an issue that was raised in the Appellant\u2019s Petition of Appeal but which his counsel, Mr Low Cheong Yeow (\u201cMr Low\u201d), stated he was not pursuing on behalf of his client, viz, the alleged unconstitutionality of s 33B(4) of the MDA (\u201cs 33B(4)\u201d) inasmuch as it violated Art 93 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (\u201cArt 93\u201d).",
      "6": "Secondly, in his written submissions, the Appellant advanced a new point that was not raised in the court below: that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the material time within the meaning of s 33B(3)(b) of the MDA (\u201cs 33B(3)(b)\u201d) and that this court therefore ought to remit this particular issue to the High Court for its decision. The significance of his bringing this new point is that, if the Appellant succeeds in establishing the requirements in s 33B(3) of the MDA (\u201cs 33B(3)\u201d), the court must, pursuant to s 33B(1)(b) of the MDA (\u201cs 33B(1)(b)\u201d), sentence him to life imprisonment instead of the death penalty. Notwithstanding the fact that Mr Low was not counsel for the Appellant in the court below, we find it disturbing that the Appellant is only raising this issue on appeal. This smacks of a drip-feed approach that might result in an abuse of the process of court. Henceforth, all applicants pursuant to the re-sentencing procedure under s 33B must indicate whether they intend to rely upon s 33B(2) or s 33B(3) of the MDA \u2013 or both provisions \u2013 at first instance. This court will not hesitate to exercise its discretion to reject any belated reliance on either of these provisions should they only arise on appeal.",
      "7": "Mr Low sought to explain to this court during oral submissions the reasons for raising s 33B(3) on behalf of the Appellant only at this stage of the proceedings. Upon taking instructions from the Appellant, Mr Low stated that the Appellant had indicated that he felt that he was suffering from some mental condition at the time of the commission of the offence. It should be noted that a Report from the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH\u201d) dated 13 February 2013 (\u201cthe IMH Report\u201d) had, in fact, already been filed and served on the Appellant much earlier (on 6 May 2013), a point which Mr Low candidly acknowledged in his written submissions. More importantly, the IMH Report stated clearly that the Appellant was not suffering from any symptoms of mental disorder at the time of the commission of the offence. Nevertheless, Mr Low sought, on behalf of the Appellant, a review and assessment of the Appellant by Dr Munidasa Winslow (\u201cDr Winslow\u201d), whose report (in Mr Low\u2019s view) had (contrary to the IMH Report) stated that the Appellant was in fact suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the commission of the offence. He is now therefore asking this court to remit the issue of the Appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the commission of the offence to the High Court for determination.",
      "8": "Mr Low also argues that this court should not render any ruling on whether or not the Appellant was merely a courier until after the Judge had considered evidence of as well as determined the issue of the Appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the commission of the offence, although he (Mr Low) was prepared to argue on the courier issue at the hearing before us. However, as we pointed out to Mr Low during the hearing, the issue as to whether or not the Appellant was a courier is a threshold issue and that if this particular issue is decided against the Appellant, the present appeal would have to be dismissed, regardless of whether or not the Appellant is able to bring himself within the ambit of s 33B(3)(b) in relation to his mental state at the time of the commission of the offence (see above at [2]).",
      "9": "It bears repeating that, in order for the applicant concerned to avail himself or herself of s 33B(3), the applicant must satisfy both limbs therein (viz, ss 33B(3)(a) and 33B(3)(b)) cumulatively. Put simply, a failure to satisfy any one of the limbs would disentitle the applicant from obtaining the benefit in s 33B(1)(b) (see above at [6]). This is clear not only from the express wording of s 33B(3) but also from the parliamentary debates surrounding the enactment of this new provision where the following was stated (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (12 November 2011) vol 89 (\u201cthe 12 November Parliamentary Debates\u201d) (Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (\u201cMr Teo\u201d)):",
      "10": "It follows that even if the applicant is able to bring himself or herself within the second limb of this provision (viz, s 33B(3)(b)), this would not be sufficient to invoke s 33B(1)(b) successfully if he or she were unable to satisfy the first limb (viz, s 33B(3)(a)) by demonstrating that he or she was merely a courier. Indeed, Mr Low candidly admitted during oral submissions before this court that that was why he had not filed a second criminal motion for re-sentencing pursuant to s 33B as he was aware that the determination of the threshold issue pursuant to s 33B(3)(a) (viz, whether the Appellant was a courier) might well be determinative of the present appeal in the manner just stated.",
      "11": "In the circumstances, it was, in our view, appropriate to proceed with hearing the arguments with regard to the threshold issue as to whether or not the Appellant was a \u201ccourier\u201d within the meaning of s 33B(3)(a) because his mental condition would be relevant, pursuant to s 33B(3)(b), if (and only if) this threshold issue is decided in his favour.",
      "12": "We should also note that counsel for the Respondent, Mr Ng Cheng Thiam (\u201cMr Ng\u201d), objected strenuously to the admission of the report by Dr Winslow (\u201cDr Winslow\u2019s Report\u201d) on the basis that it was irrelevant, inadmissible and unreliable. We will deal with this objection in a later part of this judgment.",
      "13": "This would be an appropriate juncture at which to turn to the facts as well as the decision in the court below.",
      "14": "On 20 March 2009, CNB officers raided the Appellant\u2019s hotel room in Bencoolen Street and five packets of heroin were seized. This formed the subject matter of the capital charge which was brought against the Appellant.",
      "15": "Prior to his arrest, the Appellant had already been involved in one drug transaction which did not form the subject matter of the charge brought against him (\u201cthe First Transaction\u201d). The facts surrounding the First Transaction are as follows. Three to four days before his arrest, the Appellant had been asked by one Mahadhir bin Chari (also known as \u201cMayday\u201d) to source for heroin. The Appellant complied and contacted a Malaysian supplier known as Ah Yong, who agreed to sell two pounds of heroin for $18,000. When Mayday told the Appellant that he only had $16,900, the Appellant informed Ah Yong of the same and it was subsequently agreed that Mayday would be given a three-day credit to pay the remaining $1,100. On the night of the transaction, the Appellant met Ah Yong\u2019s associate at a coffee shop and paid him the $16,900 while another associate concurrently passed Mayday the heroin at a housing block in Simei. Subsequently, the Appellant went to Mayday\u2019s flat in Simei where they used a weighing scale and empty packets to pack the heroin into 8g packets. The Appellant helped Mayday to arrange the heroin deal and pack the drugs as he owed Mayday money after a failed deal to buy methamphetamine. The Appellant also took two packets of heroin for sale after the First Transaction. According to the Appellant, he would receive the drugs at a cheaper price from Mayday and this would allow him \u201cto get more profit and repay everything which [he] owe[d] \u2018Mayday\u2019 faster\u201d.",
      "16": "After the First Transaction, on 19 March 2009, Mayday again asked the Appellant to source for two pounds of heroin (\u201cthe Second Transaction\u201d). Again, the Appellant called Ah Yong who quoted $8,500 for one pound of heroin. The Appellant relayed a series of messages between Mayday and Ah Yong and a price of $16,600 was eventually agreed upon. This time, however, the Appellant collected the heroin personally as Mayday was not feeling well. The Appellant, after collecting the money from Mayday, proceeded to a shopping centre in Bukit Timah where the Appellant passed the money to Ah Yong\u2019s associate in exchange for the heroin. The Appellant then went to Mayday\u2019s flat but there was no response at the door or to the Appellant\u2019s calls. He therefore returned to the hotel in Bencoolen with the drugs and it was there that he was arrested.",
      "17": "The Judge first held that the Appellant was not simply a courier and therefore did not meet the first requirement encapsulated in s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA. The Judge found that the Appellant\u2019s conduct went beyond transporting, sending or delivery of drugs from one point to another. In this regard, the Judge took into account the Appellant\u2019s course of conduct in the First Transaction where he had sourced for the heroin and brokered the deal between Ah Yong and Mayday. Further, the Judge noted that the Appellant would assist Mayday in repacking the heroin and would also take heroin from Mayday to sell (see the GD ([3] supra) at [17]\u2212[18]).",
      "18": "In the Judge\u2019s view, the facts pertaining to the First Transaction were relevant to his evaluation of the role of the Appellant in the Second Transaction, in so far as the context and purpose surrounding both Transactions were similar. The Judge considered that in the Second Transaction, the Appellant was similarly asked to source for the heroin and he similarly brokered the deal between Ah Yong and Mayday as well. In this regard, the Judge noted (see the GD at [21]) that \u201cit was clear that the second transaction started in the same way as the first\u201d and that \u201cthere was no evidence that his personal circumstances had changed such that he would have no further reason to help [Mayday] in the same way\u201d. The Judge also took into account that the Appellant had stated in his long statement that the reason he helped Mayday in the Second Transaction was likewise to get a discount when he received drugs from Mayday to sell (see the GD at [20]\u2212[22]).",
      "19": "The Judge further found that even if the facts of the Second Transaction were examined in isolation, they still showed that the Appellant\u2019s role had exceeded that of a mere courier given that he played an active part in sourcing for the heroin and played the role of a middleman in the negotiations between Mayday and Ah Yong (see the GD at [23]).",
      "20": "In so far as the second requirement of having substantively assisted the CNB as encapsulated in s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA (\u201cs 33B(2)(b)\u201d) was concerned, the Judge found that this was for the Public Prosecutor to decide and that the Public Prosecutor\u2019s determination in this regard could only be challenged on the basis of bad faith, malice or unconstitutionality, which had not been raised by the Appellant (see the GD at [29]).",
      "21": "The Judge also declined to accede to the Appellant\u2019s request to define the meaning of \u201csubstantively assisted\u201d so that the Public Prosecutor could decide if the Appellant could receive a certificate of assistance after applying the elucidated meaning to the facts. The Judge noted that by providing a definition of \u201csubstantively assisted\u201d, the courts would in effect be interfering with the decision-making process of the Public Prosecutor (see the GD at [31]). Further, the Judge found that there was no basis to accept the particular interpretation of \u201csubstantive assistance\u201d which was advocated for by the Appellant (ie, there would be \u201csubstantive assistance\u201d where an accused person provides information which is of \u201cpotential value\u201d and it need not be assessed on the actual effectiveness of the information) (see the GD at [36]).",
      "22": "Accordingly, the Judge affirmed the death sentence imposed on the Appellant.",
      "23": "As already noted, at the hearing before us, the Appellant did not pursue the argument to the effect that s 33B(4) was unconstitutional as it violated Art 93. He has three principal arguments which were pursued in both his written and oral submissions to this court.",
      "24": "The first (and most crucial) argument is that the Appellant was only a \u201ccourier\u201d within the meaning of s 33B (\u201cIssue 1\u201d). In particular, Mr Low argues, on behalf of the Appellant, that the Judge should not have taken into account the First Transaction in finding that the Appellant was not a courier. He submits that because the Appellant had not been charged for the First Transaction, it had no relevance in determining the Appellant\u2019s role in the Second Transaction, which was the subject matter of the proceeded charge. He takes the position that the Judge should not have assumed that the Appellant\u2019s purpose in carrying out the First and Second Transactions were the same (ie, that after collecting the drugs, he would help Mayday repack the drugs before taking some of the drugs for himself). He argues further that, taking into account only the facts of the Second Transaction (which constituted the charge against the Appellant), the Appellant was merely a courier.",
      "25": "The second argument is that the court can \u2013 and should \u2013 define the phrase \u201csubstantively assisted\u201d in s 33B(2)(b) (\u201cIssue 2\u201d).",
      "26": "The third argument is one that we have already referred to earlier in this judgment: that this court should remit the issue as to whether the Appellant was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the commission of the offence within the meaning of s 33B(3)(b) to the Judge for his decision (\u201cIssue 3\u201d). As also noted above, this particular argument will be of no avail to the Appellant if Issue 1 is decided against him.",
      "27": "The Respondent argues that the Appellant was clearly not a courier. In particular, during oral submissions before this court, Mr Ng stated that, even if the First Transaction was not taken into account, there was more than sufficient evidence for this court to conclude that the Appellant was not simply a courier in so far as the Second Transaction was concerned.",
      "28": "The Respondent argues further that the Judge was correct in declining to provide a definition of \u201csubstantive assistance\u201d within the meaning of s 33B(2)(b) as the determination as to whether or not \u201csubstantive assistance\u201d had in fact been provided by the accused lay solely within the discretion of the Public Prosecutor. Citing from the relevant Parliamentary Debates, Mr Ng argues that it was Parliament\u2019s intention that such an approach was necessary to ensure the operational effectiveness of the CNB. He also argues (again citing from the relevant Parliamentary Debates) that acceding to the Appellant\u2019s argument would give rise to a floodgate of future applications to the court (which was never Parliament\u2019s intention in the first place).",
      "29": "In so far as the Appellant\u2019s third argument is concerned, the Respondent highlights, first, that the Appellant had never raised any allegation of any abnormality of mind during the hearing below, notwithstanding the fact that he had been represented by counsel at the time. Further, the Respondent submits that, in any event, the court should not accept the Appellant\u2019s contention that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind as Dr Winslow\u2019s Report was inadmissible and irrelevant (see above at [12]).",
      "30": "The decision as to whether or not an applicant is a courier within the meaning of s 33B is a fact-sensitive one in which the court must pay close attention to both the facts as well as the context of the case at hand. In this regard, the Judge laid down the following guidelines at [15]\u2212[16] of the GD ([3] supra):",
      "31": "We agree with the Judge\u2019s observations as cited in the preceding paragraph. In the nature of things, it is impossible to lay down more specific guidelines simply because of the myriad permutations of fact situations that could possibly arise. In this regard, we also agree with the Judge that the list of relevant factors cannot be closed.",
      "32": "As is often the case, however, the difficulty lies in the application of the relevant guidelines to the facts at hand. In this regard, we will take the Appellant\u2019s case at its highest and disregard the facts as well as effect(s) of the First Transaction. Indeed, at the hearing before us, Mr Low pointed to the thorny difficulties surrounding the admissibility as well as probative value of what has been termed \u201csimilar fact evidence\u201d. However, it is well-established that there is no blanket rule against the admission of \u201csimilar fact evidence\u201d; such evidence may be utilised in the limited manner envisaged within a strict application of, for example, ss 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (see Jeffrey Pinsler SC, Evidence and the Litigation Process (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2015) at para 3.001). That this is so is evident from, for example, the decision of this court in Tan Meng Jee v PP [1996] 2 SLR(R) 178. Hence, for example, in so far as the present appeal is concerned, it could possibly have been argued that it was appropriate for the court to take the First Transaction into account for the limited purpose of demonstrating a specific state of mind on the part of the Appellant to the effect that (as the Judge found at [22] of the GD) he did intend to assist Mayday in repacking the heroin for sale in the Second Transaction as well, especially when regard is also had to the fact that the First Transaction and the Second Transaction were just a few days apart. In this regard, s 14 of the Evidence Act and (in particular) Explanation 1 thereof are potentially relevant. Explanation 1 reads as follows:",
      "33": "However, as we have already reiterated, we will take the Appellant\u2019s case at its highest and, to this end, will disregard the facts of the First Transaction and its possible effect(s) altogether. Indeed, the Judge himself was of the view that, even if he did not consider the facts as well as effect(s) of the First Transaction and had considered only the Second Transaction in isolation, he would still have found the Appellant\u2019s involvement in the Second Transaction to have gone beyond that of a mere \u201ccourier\u201d within the meaning of s 33B. In this regard, it is imperative to, inter alia, examine closely the Judge\u2019s reasoning when considering the Second Transaction in isolation. He reasoned as follows (at [23]\u2212[25] of the GD):",
      "34": "It will be immediately apparent from the paragraphs of the GD quoted above that the key paragraph is para 23, which does not refer, whether directly or indirectly, to the First Transaction. Indeed, it should be noted that the Judge himself commenced that particular paragraph by noting that \u201c[i]n any event, [the Appellant\u2019s] role had exceeded that of a courier even if the second transaction was examinedby itself\u201d [emphasis added in bold italics and underlined bold italics]. It will also be immediately apparent from that particular paragraph that what prompted the Judge to find that the Appellant\u2019s conduct had made him more than a mere courier was, in the main, the fact that he had both sourced for the heroin concerned and had played an active part as a middleman or go-between with regard to negotiations between Mayday and Ah Yong. In our view, the Judge was wholly justified in arriving at these findings. In this particular regard, Mr Ng helpfully brought our attention to the very pertinent paragraphs in the cautioned statement of the Appellant himself, which read as follows:",
      "35": "In our view, it is clear, from the Appellant\u2019s own words as quoted in the preceding paragraph that he did (as the Judge found at [23] of the GD) not only actively source for the heroin in question but also actively participated in negotiations as a middleman or go-between with regard to the price to be paid for the heroin as well as the terms of delivery of the heroin between Ah Yong as seller and Mayday as buyer.",
      "36": "It is true that, on a literal reading of the aforementioned paragraphs of his cautioned statement, the Appellant had simply been involved in passing messages. However, in our judgment, he was no mere conduit pipe. Bearing in mind the need to strictly construe the question of whether a particular act is necessary for the work of a \u201ccourier\u201d (see above at [30]), in our view, it could not be said that he was performing acts which were merely incidental in the course of transporting, sending or delivery of drugs. On the present facts, not only did he suggest, and initiate contact with, the drug supplier (ie, Ah Yong), he was also systematically involved in helping to negotiate the terms of the Second Transaction. This clearly went beyond the role of a \u201ccourier\u201d as envisaged under s 33B.",
      "37": "In the circumstances, the Appellant\u2019s arguments with regard to Issue 1 are without merit and he therefore fails to meet the threshold requirement of demonstrating that he was merely a courier.",
      "38": "As already noted, this particular issue relates to the Appellant\u2019s argument that the court can \u2013 and should \u2013 define what the phrase \u201csubstantively assisted\u201d in s 33B(2)(b) means. It is important at the outset to note that this concept of \u201csubstantive assistance\u201d pertains to assisting theCNB\u201cindisrupting drug trafficking activitieswithinoroutside Singapore\u201d. The plain language of s 33B(2)(b) could not, in our view, be clearer in itscontext and import. Indeed, it is of the first importance to point out, right at the outset, that this particular provision relates tosubject matterthat isclearly beyond the jurisdiction and power of the courts. Put simply, it concerns the extra-legalsituation relating to theCNB\u2019sdisruption of drug trafficking activities both within as well as outside Singapore. Such a situation pertains to quintessentiallyoperationalmatters that concernthe CNB, and the CNB alone. Looked at in this light, it would, in our view, be wholly inapposite for the courts, in the exercise of theirjudicialpower, to even attempt to define what the phrase \u201csubstantively assisted\u201d in s 33B(2)(b) should be. Indeed, as the language of s 33B(2)(b) makes clear, whether or not substantive assistance has, in fact, been rendered to the CNB within the meaning and scope of that particular provision is to be determined by the Public Prosecutor. This is the short \u2013 and in our view \u2013 definitive response to the Appellant\u2019s argument that is, with respect, a non-starter in the circumstances.",
      "39": "At this juncture, we pause to make an obvious point. However, it is necessary to do so because, towards the end of oral submissions before this court, the Appellant, through Mr Low, made the point most strenuously to the effect that he had furnished substantive assistance to the CNB and was therefore entitled to receive a certificate pursuant to s 33B(2)(b). Whilst we understand that the Appellant might subjectively believe that he had rendered substantive assistance to the CNB pursuant to this particular provision, this would not necessarily entitle him to a certificate of substantive assistance if the Public Prosecutor was of the view that there was, in fact, no substantive assistance rendered within the meaning of s 33B(2)(b). Indeed, as this court has observed in Muhammad Ridzuan bin Mohd Ali v AG [2015] 5 SLR 1222 at [44]\u2212[48]:",
      "40": "To return to the reasoning encapsulated above at [39], such reasoning was, in fact, elaborated upon in more detail by the Judge in the court below. In particular, the Judge referred to the relevant Parliamentary Debates during the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill (No 27 of 2012). He referred, first (in the GD ([3] supra) at [28]), to the following observations by Mr Teo in the 12 November Parliamentary Debates, where Mr Teo had stated that it was for the Public Prosecutor to determine if substantive assistance had in fact been provided in a particular case:",
      "41": "The issue as to whether the courts should decide on, or provide criteria for determining, whether an accused person had provided \u201csubstantive assistance\u201d was canvassed in the Parliamentary debates. The Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam, made the following observations (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (14 November 2012) vol 89 (\u201cthe 14 November Parliamentary Debates\u201d)):",
      "42": "The observations cited in the preceding paragraph underscore the point made earlier to the effect that it is for the Public Prosecutor to determine whether substantive assistance has been provided in the case concerned. More importantly, the Judge also elucidated the negative developments which could result if the courts attempted to define \u201csubstantive assistance\u201d (see the GD at [32]\u2212[35]):",
      "43": "We agree with the reasoning of the Judge as set out above as well as with the manner in which he distinguished the Singapore position from that in the United States and New Zealand (see the GD at [36]\u2212[40] and [41]\u2212[43], respectively).",
      "44": "For the reasons set out above, we find no merit in the Appellant\u2019s arguments in so far as Issue 2 is concerned.",
      "45": "As already noted above, in light of our decision with regard to Issue 1, Issue 3 is moot inasmuch as evidence of the Appellant\u2019s mental condition at the time of commission of the offence will not suffice to avail the Appellant of s 33B(1)(b) as he has not demonstrated that he satisfies the threshold requirement set out in s 33B(3)(a).",
      "46": "However, even if the Appellant satisfies the threshold requirement set out in s 33B(3)(a), we are of the view that he would not, in any event, satisfy the requirement set out in s 33B(3)(b). At this juncture, it would be apposite for us to make certain observations about the exception under s 33B(3)(b). Section 33B(3)(b) is, in substance, a reproduction of what is the doctrine of diminished responsibility to a charge of murder pursuant to Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). However, s 33B(3)(b) must be read and applied within the context of s 33B in general and s 33B(3) in particular. Put simply, s 33B(3)(b) is not, in and of itself, of general or (more precisely) standalone application (unlike a general defence) inasmuch as the mere demonstration that the applicant possessed an abnormality of mind within the meaning of this provision willnotavail the applicant, as noted above, except to (and only to) the extentthat his involvement in the offence concerned was as a \u201ccourier\u201d within the meaning of s 33B(3)(a). In this regard, s 33B(3)(b) is not unlike Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code which similarly does not operate as a general defence. In other words, s 33B(3) encompasses avery limitedexception inasmuch as Parliament was not minded, as a matter of policy , to extend the benefit of s 33B(1)(b) to applicants whose involvement in the offence concerned went beyond that of a courier, regardless of their mental condition. It should also be noted that the exception should be construed narrowly, as is evident from the observations made by Mr Teo during the Parliamentary debates surrounding the enactment of s 33B(3)(b) (see the 14 November Parliamentary Debates):",
      "47": "With the above considerations in mind, we turn now to consider the content of Dr Winslow\u2019s Report. Dr Winslow\u2019s Report states that \u201c[the Appellant\u2019s] results indicated that he likelymeets diagnostic criteria for ADHD [viz, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]\u201d [emphasis added] and that the results \u201calso indicated significant problems with self-concept, learning difficulties, inattentive symptoms, and restlessness consistent with his self-report\u201d. However, notwithstanding the fact that it was initially stated that the Appellant only \u201clikelymeets diagnostic criteria for ADHD\u201d, the Report proceeds (in the very next paragraph) to state a definitive diagnosis for ADHD as follows:",
      "48": "The Report proceeds to state, with reference to the Appellant\u2019s history of drug abuse, as follows:",
      "49": "Dr Winslow\u2019s Report then concludes as follows:",
      "50": "Leaving aside the point (as noted above at [47]) that there appears to be an inconsistency in the level of definitiveness in the diagnosis by Dr Winslow of the Appellant with regard to ADHD, even accepting that particular diagnosis, there is, first, no clear connection established between the diagnosis of ADHD on the one hand and the diagnosis of Stimulant Use Disorder as well as Sedative Use Disorder on the other. Put simply (and with respect), the connection (if any) is extremely general and vague.",
      "51": "More importantly, perhaps, the conclusion of the Report (reproduced above at [49], and which, by its very nature, is of crucial importance) is, with respect, also extremely general and vague \u2013 at least in so far as it purports to be relevant to the satisfaction of the criterion laid down in s 33B(3)(b).",
      "52": "In so far as the Appellant\u2019s alleged ADHD condition is concerned, it is true that the phrase \u201ccontributed to\u201d is used in Dr Winslow\u2019s Report in relation to the commission of the offence for which he was charged. However, in our judgment, the use of this particular phrase does not sufficiently explain how and to what extent this condition contributed to the commission of the offence; put simply, we fail to see a causal link between the Appellant\u2019s alleged ADHD condition and the offences which he committed. In our view, such a broad and sweeping conclusion does not come close to controverting the more contemporaneous IMH Report, wherein it was concluded that first, the Appellant \u201cdoes not have any mental disorder currently or at around the material time [ie, the time of the offence]\u201d and secondly, \u201che does not have an abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease, or injury) that substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his act of drug trafficking\u201d. It should be noted that the latter finding was framed in terms of the legal test for establishing whether a defence of diminished responsibility may be made out which, as noted above (at [46]), is similar to the inquiry under s 33B(3)(b).",
      "53": "More specifically, whilst there is also a subsequent reference to the Appellant\u2019s drug use and dependence in Dr Winslow\u2019s Report, the conclusion drawn is that \u201c[i]t is alsolikely that his [the Appellant\u2019s] heavy methamphetamine use and dependence at the time of the offenses [sic] would have impacted his judgement [sic] and impulse control\u201d [emphasis added in bold italics and underlined bold italics]. This last-mentioned conclusion is, with respect, not only extremely general and vague but is also speculative in nature. Indeed, this is why the Respondent (in relation to the point made in the report with regard to the Appellant\u2019s drug use and dependence) argues in his Supplementary Submissions \u2013 and we agree \u2013 that Dr Winslow\u2019s Report is irrelevant.",
      "54": "The Respondent also argues \u2013 persuasively, in our view \u2212 that the IMH Report and the Appellant\u2019s own investigation statements as well as the evidence adduced at his trial clearly demonstrate that the Appellant exhibited clarity of mind at or around the time of the commission of the offence. For example, the Respondent points to certain excerpts of the Appellant\u2019s testimony under cross-examination where he explained his decision not to implicate Mayday in a cautioned statement he had given to a CNB officer shortly after his arrest:",
      "55": "The Respondent further relies on the awareness of the Appellant as to what was transpiring when he agreed to be involved in the Second Transaction:",
      "56": "In addition to the above, we note in his further statement, dated 23 March 2009, his thought process in deciding to embark on his criminal behaviour:",
      "57": "In our judgment, the above shows that the Appellant did weigh the costs and benefits of embarking on this criminal conduct and made the conscious and informed decision to do so, notwithstanding that he was fully apprised of the consequences of his actions. It should also be noted that the debt which the Appellant owed to Mayday did not arise as a result, for example, of the Appellant having to satiate his drug addiction but was as a result of a botched deal in early 2009 when the Appellant went to Malaysia to source Ice for both him and Mayday.",
      "58": "We note that in the recent Singapore High Court decision of Phua Han Chuan Jeffery v PP [2016] 3 SLR 706 (\u201cJeffery Phua\u201d), Choo Han Teck J held (at [15]) that even if the applicant knew that what he was doing was wrong and risky, he may still lack the will to resist the commission of the offence and a man may know what he is doing and intend to do it and yet suffer from such abnormality of mind as substantially impairs his mental responsibility. In that case, Choo J found (at [16]) that although the accused person knew that he was committing an illegal act, he still fell within the ambit of s 33B(3)(b) because the abnormality of mind had \u201can influence on the applicant\u2019s ability to resist the act in question\u201d. It should be noted, however, that the medical experts in that case had both diagnosed the accused person with a Persistent Depressive Disorder and a Ketamine Dependence and it was on this basis that Choo J had found (at [17]) that the accused person was probably incapable of implementing any internal rationality that might have dissuaded him from committing the offence.",
      "59": "In our view, what separates the present case from that of Jeffery Phua is that Dr Winslow\u2019s Report is, at best, as noted above, neutral and does not even support the assertion that the Appellant was suffering from such abnormality of mind that impaired his mental responsibility for his criminal act.",
      "60": "More importantly, given the nature of the findings in Dr Winslow\u2019s report, we find that it cannot even be said that they are inconsistentwith those inthe IMH Report. There was therefore nothing substantive that could, in fact, have been remitted to the High Court in order for (as the Appellant requested) further evidence to be taken. Indeed, it was not even new evidence that could pass muster under the established legal principles \u2013 not least because it would not, as already explained, have had an important influence on the outcome of the case.",
      "61": "To summarise, Issue 3 is moot in light of our decision on Issue 1. In any event, Dr Winslow\u2019s Report is, at best, neutral and is of no avail to the Appellant as it is not inconsistent with the IMH Report.",
      "62": "For the reasons set out above, the appeal is dismissed."

      "1": "This appeal stemmed from a tragic case. Over a period of more than two years, the respondent, BDB (\u201cthe Respondent\u201d), repeatedly abused her own child. On the last of these occasions, the child was abused to such an extent that he died. This tragedy was exacerbated by the fact that the abuse continued even after the involvement of the Child Protective Service (\u201cthe CPS\u201d) of the Ministry of Social and Family Development (\u201cthe MSF\u201d) when the matter was first brought to the attention of the authorities. The Respondent was separated from the child for a time thereafter, but she later regained custody of the child and then continued to ill-treat him and engage in a pattern of conduct that can only be described as cruel.",
      "2": "Following investigations carried out after the child\u2019s death, the Respondent was charged under s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the child, and under s 5 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe CYPA\u201d) with ill-treating him. She pleaded guilty before a High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d), who meted out an aggregate sentence of eight years\u2019 imprisonment: see PP v BDB [2016] 5 SLR 1232 (\u201cthe GD\u201d). The sole question in this appeal by the Prosecution was whether that sentence was manifestly inadequate. At the conclusion of the oral arguments, we allowed the Prosecution\u2019s appeal and gave our brief reasons. We indicated that we would elaborate on those reasons and furnish our detailed grounds of decision in due course. This, we now do.",
      "3": "In these grounds, we examine the relevant sentencing principles for violent offences against children and young persons that lead to serious injury or death. Many, if not most, of these cases have resulted in charges being brought not for culpable homicide, but for voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 322 of the Penal Code and punishable under s 325 of that Act, and/or for ill-treating a child or young person under s 5(1) read with s 5(5)(b) of the CYPA. We therefore consider the prevailing sentencing precedents for these two offences. We then set out the approach that should guide the courts in this context. In that light, we explain our decision in this appeal. We also urge, in a closing coda, legislative reform to afford the courts the power to impose enhanced penalties for certain offences against vulnerable victims, in particular, children and young persons, in view of their heinous nature.",
      "4": "The Respondent is a 35-year-old female Singaporean. At the time of her arrest on 2 August 2014, she was residing at a flat in Eunos Crescent (\u201cthe Eunos flat\u201d) with her two children, a seven-year-old daughter (\u201c[P]\u201d) and a four-year-old son (\u201c[A]\u201d), who was the victim of the abuse.",
      "5": "A total of six charges, two under s 325 of the Penal Code and four under s 5 of the CYPA, were brought against the Respondent. The Prosecution eventually proceeded with only the two s 325 charges (the first and sixth charges) and two of the CYPA charges (the third and fourth charges), with the remaining two CYPA charges (the second and fifth charges) taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. The four charges which were proceeded with read as follows:",
      "6": "The two CYPA charges which were taken into consideration for sentencing purposes concerned, respectively, an incident on 31 July 2014 in which the Respondent pushed [A] and caused him to fall (the second charge), and an incident sometime in June 2014 in which the Respondent lifted [A] by the neck before dropping him to the ground (the fifth charge).",
      "7": "We set out below the events relating to the four charges which were proceeded with.",
      "8": "Chronologically, the events which gave rise to the sixth charge were the first to occur. Sometime in March 2012, when [A] was just two years and five months old, the Respondent was trying to teach him the alphabet. When he did not or could not follow her instructions, she became irritated with him and pushed him. Following further instructions that [A] failed to comply with, the Respondent pushed him a second time, causing him to fall to the floor. The Respondent then stepped on his ribs. Shortly after this, [A] asked if he could do some drawing. The Respondent gave him some paper, but [A] scribbled on the sofa instead. The Respondent became angry, and twisted and pulled [A]\u2019s hand very hard.",
      "9": "On 12 March 2012, the Respondent brought [A] to KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital (\u201cKK Hospital\u201d), where he was admitted from 12 March to 2 April 2012. At the hospital, the Respondent lied and claimed that [A]\u2019s injuries were a consequence of his having fallen twice: once down a flight of stairs at home the day before, and prior to that, in the playground two weeks earlier. [A] was found to have multiple fractures (on his left elbow, left calf and right eighth to eleventh ribs), haematomas on his forehead and the back of his head, several small healing bruises on various parts of his body, as well as other healed linear scars on his lower legs and lower abdomen. Developmental assessment also revealed a moderate level of expressive and receptive speech delay.",
      "10": "Arising from this incident, which was also the first reported instance of the Respondent\u2019s abuse of [A], [A] was referred to the MSF for suspected non-accidental injuries. The CPS investigated [A]\u2019s case and interviewed the Respondent, as well as [A]\u2019s father and [P]. Upon [A]\u2019s discharge from KK Hospital on 2 April 2012, he was initially placed in the care of foster caregivers identified by the CPS. Three months later, on 2 July 2012, [A] was placed under the care of his maternal uncle and the latter\u2019s wife (\u201cthe maternal relatives\u201d), who were assessed to be suitable for this purpose.",
      "11": "A few months later, in November 2012, the Respondent and [P] moved in to live with the maternal relatives and [A]. The CPS noted that during this period, no recurrence of abuse was reported. With no evident child protection concerns, the CPS treated the case as closed on 5 February 2014.",
      "12": "Sometime in the first half of 2014, the Respondent and her two children moved to the Eunos flat. It appears that this came about because of pressure from the maternal relatives, who were unhappy that there were too many people living at their home.",
      "13": "The abuse of [A] resumed shortly after the move to the Eunos flat. On 30 July 2014, the Respondent pushed [A] while they were at the Eunos flat, causing him to fall backwards and hit the back of his head against a television console table. This transpired evidently because the Respondent became angry and frustrated over [A]\u2019s failure to recite certain numbers that she had asked him to.",
      "14": "Later in the evening on the same day, the Respondent kicked [A] in the waist area. [A] had upset the Respondent because he had moved his bowels on the floor. After [A] fell as a result of being kicked, the Respondent stood on his stomach with both of her feet for a few seconds before stepping away. These two incidents on 30 July 2014 formed the factual backdrop of, respectively, the third and fourth charges.",
      "15": "Two days later, on 1 August 2014, the Respondent and [A] returned home shortly after noon after [A] had finished school for the day. Only the Respondent and [A] were present in the Eunos flat at the time. The Respondent asked [A] to recite some numbers in English and Malay, but he could not do so in Malay. Angry and disappointed, the Respondent shouted at [A]. She then ignored him for some time.",
      "16": "Meanwhile, [A] went to take a nap. He was awakened at about 4.30pm and was asked by the Respondent once again to recite the numbers in Malay. When he was unable to do so, the Respondent became agitated and pushed him on his chest. He fell backwards and hit his head on the floor. He stood up and tried to recite the numbers, but was unsuccessful. The Respondent then ignored [A] and walked towards the kitchen, with [A] following her and attempting to recite the numbers yet again. The Respondent turned and pushed [A] again on his chest, causing him to fall and hit his head on the ground again. The Respondent then stepped on [A]\u2019s knees with both legs repeatedly three or four times.",
      "17": "As it was approaching the time for the Respondent to fetch [P] home from school, she ordered [A] to shower and change after she had finished bathing. While the Respondent was in the shower, [A] stood outside and continued to recite the numbers wrongly. The Respondent ignored him and went to her room to change after her shower. While she was in her room, she heard [A] slamming the cover of the toilet bowl. She went to ask [A] what he was doing in the bathroom, but he did not answer. Instead, he continued mumbling the numbers. Frustrated, the Respondent choked [A] on his neck using her right hand and pushed him to the floor.",
      "18": "The Respondent then left [A], went to the living room and told [A] that she did not want to hear him reciting the numbers anymore. She also told [A] that he could either accompany her to fetch [P] home from school or stay at home. [A] indicated that he wanted to accompany her. She thus went to take her handbag from her room. By then, it was about 6.10pm. When the Respondent came out of her room, [A] was still not ready to leave and was still reciting the numbers. In anger, the Respondent choked [A] again by pushing her right hand against his neck and lifting him off the ground with his back against the wall. Seeing that [A] was gasping for air, the Respondent let go and [A] fell to the floor. At this point, [A] was no longer moving. The Respondent carried him to the sofa, but found him weak and unresponsive.",
      "19": "At 6.35pm, the Respondent called her sister-in-law for assistance and asked her to go over to the Eunos flat. She made the call from the void deck of her block of flats because she could not find her mobile phone. On her way back to the Eunos flat, she met her 14-year-old neighbour at the lift lobby and asked the latter for help. The neighbour arrived at the flat and noticed [A] lying face up on the sofa. Despite his eyes being open, he was unresponsive. The neighbour managed to detect his pulse and also noticed bruises on his chest. The Respondent told the neighbour that [A] had fallen and hit his head on the floor. The neighbour advised her to call an ambulance.",
      "20": "At around 6.50pm, the Respondent\u2019s sister-in-law arrived and noticed that [A]\u2019s mouth was filled with foam. She also noticed reddish marks on his neck, a reddish bump on his forehead and a very big bump on the back of his head. She and the Respondent rushed [A] to a nearby clinic. After an initial examination, [A] was conveyed by ambulance to Changi General Hospital (\u201cCGH\u201d), where he underwent an emergency craniotomy and evacuation of a subdural blood clot (a blood clot in the space between the skull and the brain). Apart from his head injuries, various bruises on [A]\u2019s body at different stages of healing were observed. After the operation, [A] was transferred from CGH to KK Hospital for further management the next day, 2 August 2014. There, he remained in a critical condition and was put on life support. He subsequently developed further complications. A conference was held with his family members, who decided to take him off life support in view of the poor prognosis. [A] eventually passed away on 5 August 2014 at 4.10pm.",
      "21": "In the autopsy report, [A]\u2019s cause of death was identified as \u201chead injury\u201d consisting of bruising of the scalp, a skull fracture and left subdural haemorrhage. The forensic pathologist concluded that the head injury had been caused by blunt force trauma.",
      "22": "After her arrest on 2 August 2014, the Respondent was first examined by Dr Subhash Gupta (\u201cDr Gupta\u201d), a consultant with the General and Forensic Psychiatry Division of the Institute of Mental Health (\u201cIMH\u201d). In his report dated 2 September 2014, Dr Gupta opined that although the Respondent had several \u201cpersonality aberrations\u201d, these did not amount to a recognisable mental disorder and the Respondent was therefore fit to plead. Dr Gupta also noted that the Respondent\u2019s personality aberrations, which he listed as \u201crecurrent suspicions regarding [the] sexual fidelity of [her] spouse/partner, tendency to act impulsively, very low tolerance [for] frustration, a low threshold for discharge of aggression, and marked proneness to blame others\u201d, made her more likely than others to cope maladaptively when faced with stressful situations.",
      "23": "Dr Tommy Tan (\u201cDr Tan\u201d), the defence expert from Novena Psychiatry Clinic, subsequently examined the Respondent. In his report dated 3 May 2015, he opined that the Respondent suffered from both Asperger\u2019s Syndrome and Major Depressive Disorder (\u201cMDD\u201d) of peri-partum onset. Dr Gupta considered Dr Tan\u2019s report and issued a clarification report dated 16 February 2016 in which he provided his response to Dr Tan\u2019s report. In essence, Dr Gupta concluded that the Respondent did not suffer from either disorder at or around the time of the offences.",
      "24": "The Prosecution and the Defence subsequently agreed to have the Respondent examined by Dr Sajith Sreedharan Geetha (\u201cDr Geetha\u201d), another doctor at the IMH and a specialist in autism spectrum disorders including Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. Dr Geetha was only asked to opine on whether the Respondent suffered from Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, and his conclusion was that she did not.",
      "25": "The Respondent was charged as stated at [5] above, and pleaded guilty on 28 March 2016 to the four charges which the Prosecution proceeded with. The Judge ordered a Newton hearing to ascertain the Respondent\u2019s psychiatric state at the material time as he considered that this would have a significant bearing on the sentence that should be imposed. The Judge also directed Dr Gupta and Dr Tan to interview more witnesses so that both psychiatrists would, as far as possible, be on an equal footing in terms of the number of witnesses they had interviewed and the information that they had access to. Dr Gupta and Dr Tan did as directed, but did not change their initial views. During the Newton hearing, a joint session involving all three experts was conducted. At the end of the Newton hearing, the Judge sentenced the Respondent on 29 July 2016 to an aggregate term of eight years\u2019 imprisonment.",
      "26": "The aggravating factors which the Judge took into account in arriving at his decision were (a) the young age of [A]; (b) the relationship between the Respondent and [A]; (c) the severity of [A]\u2019s injuries; and (d) the multitude of acts of violence involved in each of the incidents that formed the subject matter of a charge. Noting that these factors \u201calready presented themselves in the precedent cases\u201d [emphasis in original], the Judge held that there was no basis for imposing on the Respondent a sentence harsher than the range of sentences imposed in those cases (see the GD at [24]).",
      "27": "Before turning to the mitigating factors which, in his view, were absent from the precedent cases and warranted a lower sentence in the Respondent\u2019s case, the Judge addressed the Prosecution\u2019s submission that \u201cthe foremost sentencing principles in this case were deterrence and retribution\u201d (see the GD at [25]). He accepted that retribution was a relevant sentencing principle. However, he did not accept that specific deterrence was a sentencing principle that could feature heavily in the present case because the Respondent had committed the offences \u201cout of anger and [on] the spur of the moment\u201d (see the GD at [25]\u2013[27]). He took the view that where the offences were \u201ccrimes of passion\u201d, it would generally be inappropriate to invoke deterrence as a relevant sentencing consideration (see the GD at [27]).",
      "28": "The Judge then analysed the mitigating factors which he considered relevant, namely, (a) the Respondent\u2019s psychiatric condition; (b) her inability to cope with stressful situations; and (c) her remorse (see the GD at [28]). With regard to the Respondent\u2019s psychiatric condition, the Judge found that the Respondent was not suffering from either Asperger\u2019s Syndrome or MDD at the time of the offences. He preferred Dr Gupta\u2019s evidence on the issue of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome; and on the issue of MDD, he held that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the Respondent was suffering from this condition at the material time (see the GD at [30]\u2013[32]). However, he also found that the Respondent had personality aberrations which had \u201ca clear and unmistakable causal link\u201d with her offending conduct (see the GD at [35]), and considered that mitigating weight should be accorded to these personality aberrations.",
      "29": "In respect of the Respondent\u2019s inability to cope with stressful situations, the Judge noted that the offences had been committed at a time when the Respondent was left to take care of [A] by herself after moving to the Eunos flat. Prior to the move, the Respondent had had the help of various family members (such as the maternal relatives) in looking after [A]. Although the exact time when the Respondent moved to the Eunos flat in the first half of 2014 was disputed by the parties, the Judge did not consider this to be important. He highlighted the fact that the Respondent had been taking care of [A] on her own at the material time in July 2014 (see the GD at [41]), and considered that her ability to cope with all that being [A]\u2019s primary caregiver entailed was not dependent on the length of time which she had had to adjust to her new living circumstances at the Eunos flat. The Judge took this view essentially because he did not think the Respondent\u2019s personality aberrations would change with the passage of time. He considered that these personality aberrations, coupled with the Respondent\u2019s inability to bond with [A], had mitigating value. He also regarded the Respondent\u2019s financial and social problems as stress-inducing factors that aggravated her personality aberrations. In all the circumstances, the Judge concluded that the Respondent was unable to cope with her situation and this mitigated her culpability (see the GD at [42] and [44]).",
      "30": "The Judge imposed a sentence of seven years\u2019 imprisonment for the first charge and two years\u2019 imprisonment for the sixth charge as he considered that the latter \u201cinvolved harm of a considerably less serious nature\u201d than the former (see the GD at [54]\u2013[55]). As for the two CYPA charges, he imposed imprisonment terms of six months and one year for the third and fourth charges respectively (see the GD at [56]\u2013[57]). The Judge ordered the sentence for the fourth charge to run consecutively with that for the first charge, with the rest of the sentences to run concurrently. The aggregate term of imprisonment imposed was thus eight years, and this was backdated to 2 August 2014, the date of the Respondent\u2019s arrest (see the GD at [62]).",
      "31": "The Prosecution appealed on the ground that the Judge erred in law in his approach to determining the appropriate sentences. There were several aspects to its argument. The Prosecution contended, first, that mitigating weight should not have been accorded to the Respondent\u2019s personality aberrations, and, second, that it was wrong to disregard deterrence as a relevant sentencing consideration because, among other things, the Respondent\u2019s offences were not \u201ccrimes of passion\u201d. Third, the Prosecution submitted that the Judge erred in placing little weight on several aggravating factors which were relevant. Fourth, the Prosecution argued that the aggregate sentence of eight years\u2019 imprisonment was manifestly inadequate because it was not commensurate with the sentencing precedents in cases involving violence against a young child that resulted in death. The Prosecution sought the following sentences in place of those imposed by the Judge:\n(a)     for the first charge, at least eight years\u2019 imprisonment;\n(b)     for the third charge, at least 12 months\u2019 imprisonment;\n(c)     for the fourth charge, at least 18 months\u2019 imprisonment; and\n(d)     for the sixth charge, at least four years\u2019 imprisonment.",
      "32": "The Prosecution further submitted that the Judge should have ordered the sentences for the first, fourth and sixth charges to run consecutively, and sought an aggregate sentence of at least 12 years\u2019 imprisonment.",
      "33": "As against this, the Respondent\u2019s counsel submitted that the Judge correctly appreciated the relevant mitigating factors, and contended that the aggregate sentence of eight years\u2019 imprisonment was sufficient and reasonable because it adequately reflected the gravity of the Respondent\u2019s wrongdoing. While each mitigating factor, considered individually, might not have warranted a reduced sentence, an unfortunate concatenation of factors contributed to the significant pressure which the Respondent faced at the time of the offences. These factors were (a) the Respondent\u2019s personality aberrations; (b) her inability to cope and bond with [A]; (c) her financial and social problems; and (d) the lack of support which she encountered in caring for [A]. The Respondent\u2019s offences were, as the Judge rightly found, committed \u201cout of anger and \u2018in moments of hot-blooded irrationality\u2019\u201d [emphasis in original]. The sentencing considerations of general and specific deterrence should therefore not feature significantly in the present case.",
      "34": "We first deal with the relevant sentencing principles before we turn to explain the reasons for our decision in this appeal.",
      "35": "The law recognises the special need to protect certain groups of vulnerable persons, such as the handicapped, the incapacitated, children and the elderly. An offender\u2019s culpability will generally be viewed as enhanced where the victim is vulnerable. This is because the offender will, in such circumstances, be seen as exploiting or taking advantage of a relatively helpless person. In general, the more vulnerable the victim, the more culpable the offender: see Andrew Ashworth, Sentencing and Criminal Justice (Cambridge University Press, 6th Ed, 2015) at pp 168\u2013169. Our own sentencing jurisprudence has long emphasised that the victim\u2019s vulnerability is a significant aggravating consideration in sentencing: see Purwanti Parji v PP [2005] 2 SLR(R) 220 at [30] and PP v Teo Chee Seng [2005] 3 SLR(R) 250 (\u201cTeo Chee Seng\u201d) at [9].",
      "36": "In the specific context of violence against children, in PP v AFR [2011] 3 SLR 833 (\u201cAFR\u201d), we made it clear to all parents and caregivers that such violence would not be tolerated and would be met with the full force of the law (at [12]). We also observed in the earlier decision of PP v UI [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 (\u201cUI\u201d), in the context of the sexual abuse of young victims, that (at [33]):",
      "37": "In our judgment, these observations apply with equal force to the distinct but closely analogous situation of physical abuse of children.",
      "38": "By maintaining an uncompromising stance against offenders who abuse vulnerable victims, several objectives may be served. First, this helps to deter other like-minded members of the public, as was observed in PP v Law Aik Meng [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 (\u201cLaw Aik Meng\u201d) at [24(b)] and AFR at [12] and [30]. Second, by denouncing such conduct through the imposition of stiff sentences, we give expression to public outrage at the fact that the offenders in question have taken advantage of their victims\u2019 vulnerability: see Kow Keng Siong, Sentencing Principles in Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2009) (\u201cSentencing Principles in Singapore\u201d) at para 16.060. Third, the sentencing consideration of retribution is engaged in cases where serious violence is inflicted on a vulnerable victim. Fourth, imposing a severe sentence in such cases helps to ensure that the punishment is proportionate to the offender\u2019s culpability: see AFR at [32].",
      "39": "Among vulnerable victims, young victims are notable for several reasons. More often than not, there will be a gross physical disparity at play, and as a result, the victims will often be defenceless and unable to protect themselves. Moreover, the abuse will often be inflicted by parents or guardians abusing their position of trust and authority, and this makes the abuse difficult to detect and prevent. As a consequence, the abuse can continue over a sustained period of time, resulting in the accumulation of injuries with grievous consequences. For this reason, deterrence is an especially weighty consideration in offences against young victims. Indeed, when a child is abused by a person who is entrusted with the care of that child, this is itself a further aggravating factor: see PP v Firdaus bin Abdullah [2010] 3 SLR 225 (\u201cFirdaus\u201d) at [19]. Violent acts against children are particularly odious when they are committed within the setting of a familial relationship because they destroy the bonds of trust and interdependency that exist between family members: see PP v Luan Yuanxin [2002] 1 SLR(R) 613 at [17] and UI at [33].",
      "40": "The most severe cases of abuse of young victims are those resulting in the death of the victim. Many of these cases have been prosecuted not under the culpable homicide provisions found in the Penal Code (namely, ss 299 and 300), but rather, under s 325 for voluntarily causing grievous hurt. Despite the multitude of aggravating circumstances that are commonly found in these cases, a review of the relevant precedents reveals that in the most serious of these cases, where a young victim\u2019s death was caused by a parent or caregiver, the aggregate imprisonment sentence imposed for the various charges brought against the offender under s 325 of the Penal Code (and, where applicable, s 5 of the CYPA) ranged from only seven to 12 years. We examine these sentencing precedents more closely below.",
      "41": "Where grievous hurt is voluntarily caused, the offence is typically prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code, as opposed to under s 323, which deals generally with cases where simple hurt is voluntarily caused. The following kinds of hurt are deemed \u201cgrievous\u201d under s 320 of the Penal Code:",
      "42": "A charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt is much more serious than one of voluntarily causing simple hurt simply because the injuries contemplated under s 320 of the Penal Code are serious and debilitating, and extend even to death. Unsurprisingly, the permitted sentencing range in s 325 is more severe than that in s 323, and extends to imprisonment of up to ten years and may also include a fine or caning. As against this, the prescribed sentencing range for voluntarily causing simple hurt is imprisonment of up to two years or a fine of up to $5,000, or both.",
      "43": "As stated in Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (\u201cSentencing Practice\u201d) at p 266, the facts and circumstances of each offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt vary considerably, and each case must be evaluated based on its own particular facts:",
      "44": "In a similar vein, C K Thakker et al, Ratanlal & Dhirajlal\u2019s Law of Crimes: A Commentary on the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (Bharat Law House, 27th Ed, 2013) states that the sentence to be imposed for voluntarily causing grievous hurt should vary according to the seriousness of the injury (at vol 2, p 2088). This stands to reason given the wide range of injuries that may bring an offence within the ambit of s 325 of the Penal Code. The seriousness of the hurt or injury caused to the victim is thus a primary indicator of the seriousness of the offence in determining the appropriate sentence.",
      "45": "Before we analyse some of the sentencing precedents under s 325 of the Penal Code involving offenders who inflicted physical violence on young victims, we observe that written grounds explaining the sentences imposed were not issued in most of them (see, eg, the cases discussed at [48], [49] and [53] below). It follows that their precedential value will be limited: see Keeping Mark John v PP [2017] SGHC 170 at [18] and PP v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin [2017] SGHC 183 at [13]. Subject to this, we consider the precedents in two broad categories below: cases where death was caused, and cases where non-fatal serious injury was caused.",
      "46": "Of the three cases that we considered in which the victim died, written grounds are available only for Firdaus ([37] supra), and it is to this that we first turn.",
      "47": "In Firdaus, a three-year-old child was severely beaten on 14 January 2008 by his mother\u2019s boyfriend, who was his caregiver and guardian when his mother was not around. At the time of the offence, the child\u2019s mother was not present and the offender was thus charged with taking care of the child. The offender lost his temper over the child\u2019s persistent crying despite his attempts to placate the child. The offender shouted at the child and asked the child why he was so naughty. When the offender pointed to a wall that he had previously ordered the child to stand in front of as a form of punishment, the child cried even louder. The offender hit and slapped the child, all the while shouting at the child to stop. When the child still did not stop crying, the offender punched the child repeatedly in the face and jabbed upwards at the child\u2019s chin before grabbing the child by the mouth with his hand, lifting him off the ground and slamming his head into a wall. This head injury led to intracranial haemorrhage that eventually caused the child\u2019s death. This incident formed the basis of a charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the previous revised edition of the Penal Code (namely, the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe 1985 edition of the Penal Code\u201d)). The offender also faced two other charges under s 5(1) of the CYPA: one for grabbing, shaking and biting the child\u2019s penis on the same day, and one for punching the child in the head with great force two days earlier.",
      "48": "For the s 325 charge, the trial judge imposed a sentence of six years\u2019 imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. On appeal, Chan Sek Keong CJ enhanced this sentence and imposed the then maximum term of seven years\u2019 imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. Chan CJ noted (at [19]) that the fact that the victim was a young child meant that he was particularly vulnerable because he was defenceless, and this was treated as an aggravating factor. Chan CJ also stated (at [18]) that where death, which was \u201cgenerally the most serious consequence of any offence\u201d, was caused, the imposition of the maximum sentence might be warranted:",
      "49": "Having regard to the nature of the injuries caused, the circumstances in which they were inflicted (including the fact that the offender had intended to cause physical harm to the child and had in fact caused the child\u2019s death when he should have been caring for his welfare), the offender\u2019s lack of remorse and the absence of mitigating factors, Chan CJ was satisfied that the case before him fell into \u201cthe worst category of cases of causing grievous hurt\u201d and accordingly imposed the maximum sentence for the s 325 charge (at [22]).",
      "50": "Next, we briefly consider PP v Mohd Azhar bin Ghapar District Arrest Cases Nos 53650 of 2010 and others (\u201cMohd Azhar\u201d), which was cited by the Prosecution. We do not regard this case as a useful precedent not only because of the absence of detailed grounds, but also because the sentences imposed did not differentiate between the varying degrees of seriousness of the injuries caused in the incidents that were the subject matter of separate charges against the offender. In Mohd Azhar, the offender faced, among other charges, two charges under s 325 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing grievous hurt to his girlfriend\u2019s two-year-old child. The offending conduct that was the subject matter of one of the s 325 charges resulted in the child suffering an acute subdural haematoma which, in the event, ended her life. In respect of the other s 325 charge, the injuries inflicted were fractures of the child\u2019s ribs. Despite the patent difference in the seriousness of the injuries, the district judge imposed the identical sentence of seven years\u2019 imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for each of the s 325 charges. In our judgment, this could not be correct in law, and for this reason, we also did not think the decision could have any precedential value.",
      "51": "Lastly, there is the more recent decision of PP v Zaidah and Zaini bin Jamari District Arrest Cases Nos 942245 of 2015 and others (\u201cZaidah & Zaini\u201d). This too is a sentencing decision without written grounds and so has little, if any, precedential weight. However, this decision does demonstrate that a sentence at the highest end of the permitted range of punishment may be warranted where the abuse leads to the death of the victim. The victim in Zaidah & Zaini was a two-year-old child in the custody of his mother, the first accused, and under the care of his mother\u2019s boyfriend, the second accused. Each offender faced, along with numerous charges of ill-treatment under s 5(1) of the CYPA, one charge under s 325 of the Penal Code for the physical abuse that led to the child\u2019s death from a head injury. For the s 325 charge, the first accused was sentenced to nine years\u2019 imprisonment, while the second accused was sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. Presumably, the difference between the two offenders\u2019 imprisonment sentences was to account for the 12 strokes of the cane that the first accused was exempted from by reason of s 325(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe CPC\u201d).",
      "52": "We turn now to examine the cases prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code where non-fatal serious injury was caused. We tabulate these cases below for ease of reference:",
      "53": "The first two cases in the above table involved offences prosecuted under s 325 of the 1985 edition of the Penal Code, which (as noted earlier) prescribed a maximum imprisonment term of seven years, while the last two cases were prosecuted under s 325 of the present edition of the Penal Code, which provides for a maximum imprisonment term of ten years.",
      "54": "We make three observations. First, the imprisonment sentences that were imposed in these cases ranged from three years and six months under the previous sentencing regime to six years under the present sentencing regime.",
      "55": "Second, we do not find the older cases relevant or helpful for sentencing purposes. For one thing, they are decisions without any evident reasoning to explain the court\u2019s considerations, and were decided more than 20 years ago (indeed, 25 years ago in the case of Foo Ah Choo) under a different sentencing regime which prescribed a lower maximum imprisonment sentence than that which currently applies. Further, based on the nature of the injuries sustained by the victims in the older cases, it seems to us that the sentences imposed in those cases might have been inadequate. For instance, in Foo Ah Choo, the offender used canes and a slipper to assault a two-year-old child. The assault was so severe that it caused the child to suffer a life-threatening injury in the form of a perforated stomach. The child also had injuries on her forehead, cheek, abdomen, back and limbs, and lost three of her teeth. In this light, and having regard to the extreme youth and vulnerability of the victim, it seems to us that the sentence of three years and six months (after being enhanced on appeal) might have been inadequate. Similarly, the sentence of four years\u2019 imprisonment in Cindy Chandra seems to us to have been unduly lenient having regard to the severity of the injuries suffered by the child in that case and the permanence of the harm that was caused: the child became mentally and visually impaired as a result of the abuse.",
      "56": "Third, we note that the trial judge\u2019s analysis in Franklie Tan rightly focused on the severity of the injuries suffered by the victim, who was just a year old at the time of the offences. The judge considered it aggravating that the injuries were \u201cvery severe\u201d (at [10]), and inferred that considerable force had been used when the child was pushed off the bed and landed on his head, resulting in a skull fracture that needed emergency brain surgery. After noting that the custodial sentences imposed in s 325 cases where the victims died as a result of their head injuries were in the region of seven to nine years\u2019 imprisonment (with 12 strokes of the cane where the offenders were male) (at [15]), the judge took into account the fact that the victim in Franklie Tan survived and concluded that a sentence of six years\u2019 imprisonment and six strokes of the cane was appropriate. The offender\u2019s appeal to the High Court was dismissed.",
      "57": "In the light of the above review of the precedents, we turn to the sentencing approach to be taken in cases prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code. The primary sentencing objective in such cases is likely to be deterrence. Further, retribution may also be relevant as a sentencing consideration where heinous violence has been inflicted. In our judgment, we think that sentencing in such cases should be approached in a two-step process as follows:\n(a)     First, because the seriousness of the injury caused underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s 325, it is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing.\n(b)     Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender\u2019s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.",
      "58": "In our judgment, given the inherent mischief that underlies the offence under s 325, and considering that a more severe sentencing range is prescribed for this offence (compared to the offence of voluntarily causing simple hurt under s 323) precisely because grievous hurt has been caused, the factor that should guide the court\u2019s determination of the indicative starting point for sentencing should be the seriousness of the hurt caused to the victim. As we have already noted, s 325 encompasses a broad spectrum of different forms of grievous hurt ranging from a simple fracture to death. We do not propose to set out a range of indicative starting points for each type of grievous hurt, but what is relevant for present purposes is that in a case where the grievous hurt takes the form of death (as in the case of the first charge against the Respondent), the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around eight years, which is close to the maximum imprisonment term of ten years; whereas in a case where the grievous hurt takes the form of multiple fractures of the type and gravity described in the sixth charge against the Respondent, the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around three years and six months. For the avoidance of doubt, we wish to make it clear that the indicative starting point might be higher or lower depending on the type and seriousness of the injuries caused. These indicative starting points may then be calibrated upwards or downwards in view of the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.",
      "59": "In determining the above indicative starting points, we have taken into account the following considerations.",
      "60": "First, as we have noted, in general, because of the importance of the degree of harm as a sentencing consideration in grievous hurt offences under s 325 of the Penal Code, the indicative starting points should correspond to the seriousness of the injury caused to the victims. This should be assessed along a spectrum, having regard to considerations such as the nature and permanence of the injury.",
      "61": "Second, the court should have regard to the full breadth of the permitted sentencing range, and the indicative starting points should reflect this, while allowing room for the sentencing judge to make adjustments based on the offender\u2019s culpability and other relevant circumstances.",
      "62": "Third, we agree with Chan CJ\u2019s holding in Firdaus ([37] supra) that death is generally the most serious consequence of any offence and may warrant the imposition of the maximum sentence in appropriate cases. Where death results from the infliction of severe physical violence on a young victim, this would warrant a sentence close to the statutory maximum. This is also consistent with the court\u2019s approach to fatal child abuse cases prosecuted under s 304(b) of the Penal Code as culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which carries a similar maximum imprisonment term of ten years. In s 304(b) cases that involve parents or caregivers causing the death of young children, the period of imprisonment imposed by our courts has generally been close to, if not set at, the maximum imprisonment term of ten years: see for instance, PP v Mohd Ismail bin Abdullah Criminal Case No 37 of 1994 and PP v Devadass s/o Suppaiyah Criminal Case No 41 of 1997, in both of which the maximum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment was imposed; see also Teo Chee Seng ([34] supra) and PP v Dwi Arti Samad Criminal Case No 12 of 2000, where seven-year and eight-year imprisonment terms were imposed respectively. In AFR ([35] supra), where the offender\u2019s 23-month-old daughter died after the offender inflicted \u201cdisturbing brutal violence\u201d on her, the offender\u2019s imprisonment term for a s 304(b) charge was enhanced on appeal from six years to the maximum ten years, along with ten strokes of the cane.",
      "63": "The sentencing framework which we set out here is not meant to be rigidly applied, and, as noted at [41] above, each case must be assessed based on its own particular facts. The indicative starting points should be adjusted according to the facts of the particular case before the sentencing judge. This would allow sentencing judges to better calibrate sentences according to the circumstances of each case.",
      "64": "As mentioned at [55(b)] above, the indicative starting point arrived at by the sentencing judge should be adjusted either upwards or downwards based on the judge\u2019s assessment of the offender\u2019s culpability, which entails a holistic assessment of the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors. We set out below some of the aggravating factors that would generally be relevant in this context:\n(a)     the extent of deliberation or premeditation;\n(b)     the manner and duration of the attack;\n(c)     the victim\u2019s vulnerability;\n(d)     the use of any weapon;\n(e)     whether the attack was undertaken by a group;\n(f)     any relevant antecedents on the offender\u2019s part; and\n(g)     any prior intervention by the authorities.",
      "65": "Where the facts of the case demonstrate a degree of deliberation or premeditation, the offender\u2019s culpability would generally be increased. If a weapon is used in the attack (see [67] below), the degree of premeditation involved in procuring the weapon may also be relevant. In this regard, we note that physical child abuse cases are often committed out of anger or annoyance. The lack of premeditation in such situations may at most only amount to the absence of an aggravating circumstance, and not the existence of a mitigating circumstance.",
      "66": "The viciousness of the offender\u2019s actions may be inferred from the circumstances of the attack, such as the frequency and recurrence of the attacks, and the length of time over which the attacks are carried out. The focus here is not on the direct consequences of the attack, namely, the injuries inflicted, since that has already been properly taken into consideration at the first stage of the sentencing process when determining the appropriate indicative starting point (see [55(a)] above). Rather, the focus here is on the offender\u2019s culpability, and this will entail an inquiry into whether there was cruelty in the manner of the attack and whether the victim\u2019s agony was exacerbated by the manner in which the injuries were inflicted. For instance, in Firdaus, the offender\u2019s culpability was assessed to be high considering that the offender had (among other things) punched the three-year-old child in the face several times before grabbing him by the mouth and slamming him into the wall. And even after that, the offender did not stop, but instead continued to slap the child on his back.",
      "67": "The victim\u2019s vulnerability is a seriously aggravating consideration. The greater the advantage which the offender enjoys over the victim and exploits, the greater his culpability. Such advantage need not only be physical, although this will often be the case in the context of young victims. And such advantage may be given additional aggravating weight where the victim\u2019s vulnerability is also rooted in the relationship of trust and dependence that exists between the victim and the offender.",
      "68": "In UI ([35] supra), we noted (at [33]) that parents betray the ultimate relationship of trust and authority when they abuse their children, and that for this reason, a parent would typically receive a harsher punishment for such abuse (see [35] above). In a similar vein, in AFR ([35] supra), we observed (at [15]\u2013[16]) a difference in sentencing between s 304(b) cases that involved parents causing the deaths of young children under their care and s 304(b) cases that involved caregivers doing the same. It was noted that the period of imprisonment imposed by our courts for the latter category of cases was \u201cslightly shorter\u201d than that imposed for the former category of cases, the maximum imprisonment sentence of ten years being common to both categories of cases.",
      "69": "The use of a weapon to inflict grievous hurt will increase the offender\u2019s culpability. Where dangerous weapons are used, the offence may even be prosecuted under the aggravated offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means under s 326 of the Penal Code, which carries a higher maximum sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment or even life imprisonment and may also include a fine or caning. In addition, regard should be had to the nature of the weapon and the way it was used, and how these aggravate the offender\u2019s culpability.",
      "70": "Where the abuse takes place in a group setting with other co-offenders involved, this will enhance the offenders\u2019 culpability. This may be especially pertinent in child abuse cases involving more than one caregiver, such as Zaidah & Zaini ([49] supra), where a two-year-old child\u2019s mother and her boyfriend abused the child on numerous occasions for more than a month on an almost daily basis. They had done so both separately as well as together. In cases where two or more offenders assault a defenceless child together, the sentence imposed on the offenders should be adjusted upwards to reflect their higher culpability.",
      "71": "The presence of relevant antecedents on the offender\u2019s part is an aggravating factor because it signals a greater need for specific deterrence: see Tan Kay Beng v PP [2006] 4 SLR(R) 10 (\u201cTan Kay Beng\u201d) at [14]. In this regard, previous convictions for voluntarily causing grievous hurt are not the only relevant antecedents. Where the offence involves a young victim, antecedents relating to other types of offences against such victims (which may range from ill-treatment offences under the CYPA to serious sexual offences against minors) may also be considered to be relevant. In addition, it is pertinent to consider the seriousness and the number of relevant antecedents.",
      "72": "Lastly, we consider that the need for specific deterrence is also enhanced when an offender continues to abuse a young victim despite prior intervention by the CPS (as in the present case) or any other organisation that deals with child protection concerns.",
      "73": "We now outline the typical mitigating factors that are raised by offenders in cases prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code. These include:\n(a)     the offender\u2019s mental condition;\n(b)     the offender\u2019s genuine remorse; and\n(c)     the offender\u2019s personal financial or social problems.",
      "74": "Mitigating value may be attributed to an offender\u2019s mental condition in certain situations. The first issue in this context is whether the nature of the mental condition is such that the offender retains substantially the mental ability or capacity to control or restrain himself (see PP v Chong Hou En [2015] 3 SLR 222 (\u201cChong Hou En\u201d) at [28] and Ang Zhu Ci Joshua v PP [2016] 4 SLR 1059 at [3]). Hence, medical evidence to establish a causal connection between the mental condition and the commission of the offence will be important in persuading the court to give a diagnosis of a mental disorder significant mitigating value. The focus of the inquiry will be on whether the evidence establishes that the offender\u2019s mental responsibility for his criminal acts was substantially diminished at the time of the offence by reason of his mental condition. The sentencing principle of general deterrence may be accorded full weight in circumstances where the offender\u2019s mental condition is not serious or is not causally related to the commission of the offence and the offence is a serious one (see Chong Hou En at [24(c)] and Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP [2015] 5 SLR 122 (\u201cVasentha\u201d) at [74]).",
      "75": "By way of illustration, in Firdaus ([37] supra), Chan CJ reasoned (at [22]) that the offence in PP v Rosnani bte Ismail District Arrest Case No 19936 of 2000 (\u201cRosnani\u201d) was less serious than the offences before him in Firdaus because the offender in Rosnani was mentally retarded and this mitigated her offence.",
      "76": "We have also generally considered that circumstances demonstrating the offender\u2019s genuine remorse may be accorded mitigating weight. This may be relevant in situations where a timely admission of guilt or cooperation with the authorities in their investigations reflects genuine remorse. However, an offender\u2019s plea of guilt should be given little weight if the evidence against him is strong and he has little choice but to plead guilty: see Vasentha at [71]. Similarly, the offender\u2019s cooperation with the investigating authorities should not be regarded as a strong mitigating factor if there is overwhelming evidence against him: see Chia Kah Boon v PP [1999] 2 SLR(R) 1163 at [12] and Vasentha at [73].",
      "77": "An often-cited factor raised by offenders relates to the difficult personal circumstances that they faced at the time of the offences. This will rarely, if ever, have mitigating value: see Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP [1993] 2 SLR(R) 406 at [10] (in the context of the offence of giving false information to a public servant) and PP v Osi Maria Elenora Protacio [2016] SGHC 78 at [8] (in the context of the offence of criminal breach of trust). In the context of offences against young victims (as well as other vulnerable victims), this proposition applies with even greater force because the frustrations faced by a parent or caregiver due to his or her difficult personal circumstances can never justify or excuse the abuse of such victims. As we emphasised in AFR ([35] supra) at [12]:",
      "78": "In cases prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code, our courts have invariably imposed, in addition to imprisonment sentences, caning of at least six strokes where the offender in question is not exempted from caning under the CPC. As the authors of Sentencing Practice have noted (at p 266), caning \u201cis also appropriate unless there are exceptional circumstances\u201d. Where violence has been inflicted on a victim, retribution is likely to be the principal sentencing consideration that warrants the imposition of caning: see Sentencing Principles in Singapore at paras 6.021 and 30.023, as well as Amin bin Abdullah v PP [2017] SGHC 215 (\u201cAmin\u201d) at [63]. In our judgment, where death is caused, a sentence of 12 or more strokes of the cane may be warranted; whereas where non-fatal serious injury is caused, a sentence of between six and 12 strokes of the cane may be considered.",
      "79": "We now consider the relevant sentencing considerations for the CYPA charges against the Respondent before turning to apply these principles to the present appeal. Section 5 of the CYPA provides as follows:",
      "80": "The earliest predecessor of the CYPA, the Children and Young Persons Ordinance 1949 (No 18 of 1949), was enacted in 1949 to provide for the rescue, care, protection and rehabilitation of children and young persons. Currently, s 5 of the CYPA, titled \u201cIll-treatment of child or young person\u201d, is located in Part II of the CYPA, which deals with the welfare and protection of children and young persons. Section 5 came into effect in 2001 and replaced the former s 4 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 1994 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe 1994 CYPA\u201d); for present purposes, the two provisions are essentially the same.",
      "81": "Section 5 is an all-encompassing section targeted at all forms of ill-treatment of children and young persons. It covers the entire spectrum of child abuse ranging from neglect or emotional abuse to physical and sexual abuse, with the relevant harm ranging from physical or emotional injury to injury to the child\u2019s health or development. Although \u201cemotional injury\u201d is not defined in the CYPA, s 4(g), which furnishes an example of when a child or young person is in need of care or protection from such injury, sheds some light:",
      "82": "Under s 2(1) of the CYPA, a \u201cchild\u201d is defined as a person under the age of 14 years, and a \u201cyoung person\u201d, as a person who is between the ages of 14 and 16 years. Section 5(2) defines \u201cill-treatment\u201d, while s 5(3) expands on what \u201cneglect\u201d means. From the plain words of the provision, the operative mischief targeted by s 5 of the CYPA is physical or sexual abuse (s 5(2)(a)) and wilful or unreasonable harm to or neglect of young victims (ss 5(2)(b) and 5(2)(c) respectively).",
      "83": "The 1994 CYPA incorporated enhanced penalties for child abuse and neglect. Before the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 (Act 1 of 1993) repealed and re-enacted (with amendments) the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe 1985 CYPA\u201d), s 5 of the 1985 CYPA prescribed lower penalties for what was then termed \u201cCruelty to children and young persons\u201d. At the second reading of the Children and Young Persons Bill (No 38 of 1992), the then Minister for Community Development, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, explained why the penalties were to be increased (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (18 January 1993) vol 60 at cols 449\u2013450):",
      "84": "At the same Parliamentary session, several other Members of Parliament endorsed this proposed amendment. The then Deputy Speaker, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi, stated (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (18 January 1993) vol 60 at cols 452\u2013453):",
      "85": "Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon also alluded to the principle of general deterrence as the main consideration behind the proposed increased penalties (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (18 January 1993) vol 60 at col 454):",
      "86": "In these Parliamentary statements, the clear abhorrence of child abuse is evident, as is the importance of imposing harsh sentences to deter potential child abusers, especially where the abuse leads to the death of a child or young person. This forms the background to the distinction that is now drawn in s 5(5) of the CYPA in the range of permissible sentences for fatal and non-fatal child abuse cases, as well as the increase in the maximum imprisonment sentence from the original maximum of two years\u2019 imprisonment under s 5 of the 1985 CYPA.",
      "87": "It follows that the sentencing considerations of deterrence and retribution are just as relevant in the context of child abuse offences prosecuted under s 5 of the CYPA as in those prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code. We also consider that factors similar to those outlined at [63]\u2013[75] above would be relevant in deriving the appropriate sentence on the facts of each case.",
      "88": "For non-fatal child abuse cases, the offender is liable under s 5(5)(b) of the CYPA to a fine not exceeding $4,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding four years, or both. We observe that in the relevant precedents cited by the parties that involved physical violence to children or young persons, the courts invariably imposed a term of imprisonment of at least six months for offences prosecuted under s 5 of the CYPA. We also note that in general, offenders who wilfully inflict injury on a child or young person may be regarded as being more culpable than offenders who act unreasonably in doing so, and should therefore receive harsher sentences than the latter category of offenders: see PP v Kusrini bte Caslan Arja [2017] SGHC 94 at [7], where Tay Yong Kwang JA opined that the case before him, which involved three unreasonable acts of ill-treatment of a child, was not as grave as cases where pain and suffering were wilfully inflicted on a child.",
      "89": "In that light, we turn to our decision in the present appeal.",
      "90": "We disagreed with the sentences imposed by the Judge for several reasons. First, we were satisfied that the Judge erred in finding that the sentencing objective of deterrence was not relevant in this case. In our judgment, both general and specific deterrence were relevant sentencing considerations.",
      "91": "Deterrence, as a general sentencing principle, aims to signal to and create an awareness in the public and among potential offenders that a particular type of offending behaviour will not be condoned, and that punishment for such behaviour will be certain and unrelenting: see Tan Kay Beng ([69] supra) at [31]. There are two aspects to deterrence: deterrence of the offender and deterrence of likely offenders, corresponding to specific and general deterrence respectively: see PP v Tan Fook Sum [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022 at [18].",
      "92": "In the court below, the Judge accepted that retribution was a relevant sentencing principle, but did not accept that deterrence was a sentencing principle which could feature significantly in the present case because the Respondent had committed the offences out of anger and on the spur of the moment (see the GD at [25]\u2013[27]; see also [27] above). He was of the view that where the court was dealing with \u201ccrimes of passion\u201d, it might often be inappropriate to invoke deterrence as a sentencing consideration given that a person who was acting on the passion of the moment might not be susceptible to deterrence by considering the consequences that were likely to ensue. However, the Judge also accepted (at [26] of the GD) that it was \u201cuncontroversial\u201d that offences against vulnerable victims \u201cnormally warrant general deterrence\u201d. We therefore understand his comments on the inapplicability of the principle of deterrence as being directed at specific deterrence.",
      "93": "There are three reasons, in our judgment, why the Judge erred in concluding that specific deterrence was not relevant in this case.",
      "94": "First, we disagree with the Judge\u2019s view that the Respondent\u2019s offences were \u201ccrimes of passion\u201d that were committed on the spur of the moment. We elaborate on this below at [109]\u2013[114].",
      "95": "Second, even if the circumstances of this case did render the Respondent\u2019s offences \u201ccrimes of passion\u201d, the mere fact that an offence is committed out of anger does not in itself suggest that there is no room for considering the applicability of deterrence as a sentencing objective. Our jurisprudence, as rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, in fact goes the other way in viewing certain crimes committed out of anger as warranting general deterrence. Such a policy can be seen in the context of road rage cases, where the court is mindful of the need to deter people from resorting to violence on the roads on the slightest provocation (see PP v Lee Seck Hing [1992] 2 SLR(R) 374 at [11]\u2013[12]), as well as in the context of cases involving the abuse of domestic workers (see ADF v PP [2010] 1 SLR 874 at [58]\u2013[59]).",
      "96": "Third, the fact that an offence is committed out of anger does not mean that the offender was not able to make rational decisions at the material time. The law expects a person to be in control of his emotions and conduct even in moments of grave anger, and to face the consequences of failing to do so. Deterrence is concerned with making it clear what those consequences are likely to be even if the proscribed act is done in a moment of anger.",
      "97": "The principle of deterrence treats offenders and potential offenders as rational actors who are capable of acting prudently, and who are therefore likely to see the threat of punishment as a reason for not breaking the law: see PP v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang [2007] 4 SLR(R) 753 at [26]. In Law Aik Meng ([36] supra), it was noted (at [22]) that deterrence might not be as effective in certain situations where the offender was thought to be \u201cundeterrable\u201d:",
      "98": "Drawing an analogy with when a mental condition would give rise to \u201cundeterribility\u201d, the High Court in Chong Hou En ([72] supra) at [28] and Chan Chun Hong v PP [2016] 3 SLR 465 at [73] held that an offender should be deemed to be capable of being deterred by punishment and should therefore face the consequences imposed by the law as long as it could be shown that \u201cthe offender\u2019s ability to appreciate the nature and consequences of his actions\u201d and \u201cto stop himself from committing the criminal act\u201d had not been substantially impaired. This is an important point because it requires the court to go behind assertions of temper and rage and analyse (a) whether there is in fact expert evidence to establish an inability on the part of the offender to make the appropriate choices; and also (b) whether, on the facts of the case, the offender was labouring under such an inability at the material time.",
      "99": "There is a further point which was noted in Mohammed Ali bin Johari v PP [2008] 4 SLR(R) 1058 at [114], where we affirmed the following observations of Prof A J Ashworth in \u201cThe Doctrine of Provocation\u201d [1976] CLJ 292 at p 319:",
      "100": "In our judgment, it would generally be untenable to contend that deterrence as a sentencing consideration has been displaced where an offence is committed out of anger, absent clear evidence that the offender was unable to stop himself from committing the act in question. Indeed, as we emphasised in AFR ([35] supra) at [41], anger should not be accepted as a mitigating factor in child abuse cases. Thus, leaving aside the possible relevance of the Respondent\u2019s personality aberrations, we are satisfied that both general and specific deterrence, in addition to retribution, should feature prominently as sentencing considerations in this case.",
      "101": "Another reason why we disagreed with the sentences imposed by the Judge was that in our view, the Judge placed undue weight on certain alleged mitigating factors which were either irrelevant or not in fact made out. Relying on the Respondent\u2019s personality aberrations coupled with various other stress factors, the Judge concluded that the offences in this case were committed on the spur of the moment and that the Respondent\u2019s culpability was therefore reduced. For the reasons that follow, we agreed with the Prosecution that the Judge placed undue weight on these alleged mitigating factors.",
      "102": "Dealing first with the relevance of the Respondent\u2019s personality aberrations (as set out at [22] above), we considered that the Judge erred in regarding these personality aberrations as having mitigating value.",
      "103": "In the proceedings below, after the Respondent pleaded guilty, a Newton hearing was conducted to address the specific issue of whether the Respondent was suffering from a mental disorder that caused her to injure her own child as she did. The Prosecution\u2019s position was that the Respondent only had personality aberrations which did not affect her ability or capacity to control herself. Citing Dr Gupta\u2019s evidence, the Prosecution submitted that these personality aberrations were personality traits rather than symptoms or signs of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome or any other mental or personality disorder.",
      "104": "As we mentioned earlier at [28] above, the Judge found that the Respondent was not suffering from any recognised mental disorder at the time of the offences, but he nonetheless drew a causal link between her personality aberrations and her offending conduct (see the GD at [35]). In this regard, he relied on the last paragraph of Dr Gupta\u2019s report dated 2 September 2014 (see [22] above), which expressed the opinion that the Respondent had:",
      "105": "In our judgment, and with respect, the Judge erred in his appreciation of the proper context of Dr Gupta\u2019s expert opinion. We reiterate that it was common ground that the Respondent\u2019s various personality aberrations as identified in Dr Gupta\u2019s report did not amount to an established mental disorder. When Dr Gupta was asked by defence counsel what caused these personality aberrations, he answered that it was not possible to say. Dr Tan\u2019s evidence was similarly inconclusive as to the causes of these personality aberrations. In the circumstances, it was impossible to conclude, without more, that these personality traits should reduce the Respondent\u2019s culpability. Individuals react differently when faced with stress factors. To treat as a mitigating circumstance an offender\u2019s tendency to be aggressive and/or to be prone to blame others when facing stressful situations even though this does not amount to any recognisable mental disorder and did not substantially impair the offender\u2019s mental responsibility for his conduct at the material time would seem to reward appallingly bad social behaviour. The mitigating value of a psychiatric condition depends on, among other factors, the existence of a causal connection between that condition and the commission of the offence (see Chong Hou En ([72] supra) at [28]). In the present case, the Respondent simply had no mental disorder, and the mere fact that she was aggressive and yielded to that aggression does not mean that she lost control of her impulses when she committed the offences or that her aggressive personality should in some way be treated as a mitigating circumstance.",
      "106": "It is not illogical to draw a causal link between an offender\u2019s personality trait of readily resorting to aggression in stressful situations and the offender\u2019s criminal conduct in giving vent to his aggression and using violence. However, to accord mitigating value to such a personality trait is erroneous. To put it another way, the Respondent\u2019s aggressive personality might help to explain what she did when she committed the offences, but it in no way excuses or even reduces her culpability for abusing and ill-treating [A].",
      "107": "In this regard, we find the case of R v Murukaiyan Rasoo [1957] MLJ 26 (\u201cMurukaiyan Rasoo\u201d) illustrative of the approach which a sentencing court should take towards an offender\u2019s alleged personality traits. In that case, which involved a charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, the trial judge had imposed what the appellate court described as \u201ca very light sentence\u201d \u2013 namely, binding over for one year in the sum of $500 \u2013 on the offender for his knife attack on his ex-fianc\u00e9e. The trial judge decided on this sentence after taking into account \u201cthe personality of the accused\u201d and the fact that he was \u201chighly sensitive and emotional\u201d. On appeal by the Prosecution against the sentence, the offender\u2019s counsel submitted that the sentence should not be enhanced because the offender suffered from \u201csome temperamental defect\u201d. Whitton J rejected this argument, noting that there was no suggestion that the offender suffered from a mental disorder, and that the medical expert had merely testified that the offender was \u201cemotionally immature\u201d. Whitton J thus allowed the Prosecution\u2019s appeal and enhanced the sentence to six months\u2019 imprisonment.",
      "108": "The situation in the recent decision of Chong Yee Ka v PP [2017] 4 SLR 309 (\u201cChong Yee Ka\u201d) was converse to that in Murukaiyan Rasoo. In Chong Yee Ka, See Kee Oon J departed from the sentencing precedents (at [86]) and imposed a fine instead of a custodial sentence in respect of three charges of voluntarily causing hurt. He did so in the light of \u201ca diagnosis of psychiatric disorder of sufficient severity as to significantly diminish the offender\u2019s culpability\u201d (at [86]). See J rightly pointed out (at [80] and [82]) that it would not be practicable to specify precisely how substantial the impairment of an offender\u2019s mental state would have to be in order to warrant consideration as a mitigating factor because each case should be carefully considered within its factual matrix. However, he helpfully framed the inquiry as \u201cwhether the disorder(s) in question can be said to have contributed so significantly to the offending conduct that it diminishes the offender\u2019s capacity to exercise self-control and restraint, and hence reduces her culpability in the circumstances\u201d (at [82]).",
      "109": "In Chong Yee Ka, it was undisputed that the offender had been suffering from postnatal depression linked to caregiver stress and multiple family-related stress factors. See J thus accepted (at [74]) that the offender\u2019s difficult personal circumstances rendered her \u201cmore prone to impulsive, unpredictable and irrational acts including those involving violence to the victim as well as ... acts of self-harm\u201d. Unlike the present case, both the Prosecution\u2019s and the Defence\u2019s experts in Chong Yee Ka had diagnosed the offender as having depression of moderate severity. In the circumstances, See J found (at [64]) that the offender\u2019s psychiatric condition \u201cwould have caused her to have difficulties controlling her emotions and impulses and would have contributed to her loss of self-control that led to the commission of the offences\u201d [emphasis added]. It may be noted that the offender in that case, apart from pleading guilty and demonstrating her remorse, had sought treatment for her condition, taking cognisance of her wrongdoing.",
      "110": "For these reasons, we were satisfied that the Judge erred in taking into account the Respondent\u2019s personality aberrations as a mitigating factor.",
      "111": "We turn now to the Judge\u2019s characterisation of the Respondent\u2019s offences as \u201ccrimes of passion\u201d which, in his view, should be given mitigating weight. We did not agree. We touched on this earlier at [91]\u2013[96] above in considering whether it is legitimate to disregard deterrence as a sentencing consideration when an offence is committed out of anger. Here, we consider whether there was any ground to view the Respondent\u2019s offences as \u201ccrimes of passion\u201d and, on that basis, accord mitigating value to this factor. In our judgment, while there might well have been no premeditation involved in the present case, taking that at its highest, it would only mean the absence of an aggravating circumstance and not the existence of a mitigating circumstance (see [63] above). On the evidence, the assaults which formed the subject matter of the charges against the Respondent were not the actions of a person who had lost her senses. Instead, the Respondent\u2019s attacks on [A] were responses to specific acts of [A], and were cruel and vindictive.",
      "112": "With regard to the third charge, the Respondent admitted pushing [A], causing him to fall backwards and hit the back of his head against a television console. She had evidently done so because she was frustrated that [A] failed to recite certain numbers that she had asked him to (see [13] above). There was no evidence to suggest that she had lost her senses to the extent of being in a state of hot-blooded irrationality on account of [A]\u2019s failure to recite those numbers.",
      "113": "As to the fourth charge, the Respondent admitted kicking [A] in the waist area after he had moved his bowels on the floor. This assault was not even an immediate reaction. It was only after [A] had cleaned himself up and gone to the Respondent that she kicked him. After [A] fell due to her kick, the Respondent then stepped on his stomach with both feet for a few seconds before moving away (see [14] above). These actions could not be said to be acts of \u201cpassion\u201d; they were simply acts of vindictiveness.",
      "114": "In respect of the sixth charge, the Respondent, irritated by [A]\u2019s inability to follow her instructions as she attempted to teach him the alphabet, pushed him. When [A] failed to comply with her further instructions, she pushed him a second time, causing him to fall, and also stepped on his ribs. [A] then asked if he could draw, so the Respondent gave him some paper. But [A] scribbled on the sofa instead. In anger, the Respondent proceeded to twist and pull his hand very hard. This series of actions did not suggest that the Respondent had committed these acts (or any of them) on the spur of the moment. On the contrary, the Respondent\u2019s actions were deliberate responses to particular actions by [A]. There was nothing to suggest that she had lost control.",
      "115": "Similarly, in relation to the assaults on 1 August 2014 which resulted in [A]\u2019s death (the subject matter of the first charge), four episodes of abuse were carried out intermittently over about two hours from approximately 4.30pm to 6.30pm. The Respondent had ample time to cool down during this period even if she had been extremely angry with [A]. This included the period when she simply ignored [A] for a time and when she went to take a shower in between the episodes. The Respondent even had the presence of mind to remember to pick her daughter up, and had asked [A] if he wanted to accompany her or stay at home (see [18] above). In our judgment, and with respect, the Judge failed to give appropriate consideration to the entire sequence of events and thus erred in holding that the Respondent\u2019s assaults on [A] on 1 August 2014 were committed on the spur of the moment.",
      "116": "It is also pertinent that the Respondent told Dr Gupta that she had committed the assaults to \u201cdiscipline\u201d [A]. This intention to \u201cdiscipline\u201d [A] is borne out in a note that the Respondent wrote to her then boyfriend on 2 July 2014, approximately a month before the last instances of abuse on 30 July and 1 August 2014. In that note, the Respondent said that she taught [A] his homework and \u201cdiscipline [sic] him\u201d. Having regard to the nature, timing and frequency of the Respondent\u2019s violent attacks on [A], we reject any suggestion that these assaults were not deliberate. They were certainly not spontaneous and irrational reactions by the Respondent in a moment of a total loss of control.",
      "117": "Finally, we are not persuaded that the Respondent\u2019s alleged inability to cope due to her financial and social problems could be viewed as a mitigating factor. As we have observed above (at [75]), the frustrations faced by a parent or caregiver due to difficult personal circumstances can never justify or excuse the abuse of young victims.",
      "118": "In the circumstances, we disagreed with the Judge\u2019s view that there were relevant mitigating factors in the present case.",
      "119": "In fact, we considered that the gravity of the Respondent\u2019s offences (and hence, her culpability) was aggravated by several factors that, in our respectful view, the Judge did not accord sufficient weight to.",
      "120": "First, there was the extreme youth of [A]. At the time the offences were committed, [A] was between two and four years of age. Although the Judge appeared to recognise the young age of [A] as an aggravating factor (see the GD at [24]), he reasoned that to the extent that this factor already presented itself in the precedent cases, it did not warrant an increase in the sentences imposed in those cases (see [26] above). We note, however, that the victims in the precedents cited to the Judge were of varying ages ranging from two to 12 years. In general, the younger the victim, the more defenceless he or she would be (see, in this regard, [37] and [65] above). Here, the extreme youth of [A] was a seriously aggravating factor, but it was not adequately appreciated by the Judge.",
      "121": "Second, the Respondent, as the biological mother of [A], had a particular duty to protect him. The betrayal of this critical relationship of trust and dependence was a separate and seriously aggravating factor. As we stated in UI ([35] supra) at [33], a parent who betrays that relationship and harms his or her child will generally stand at \u201cthe furthest end of the spectrum of guilt\u201d [emphasis in original]. The Judge, however, appeared to have overlooked this.",
      "122": "Third, the Judge failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that the Respondent\u2019s pattern of conduct as a whole pointed to cruelty towards a defenceless child. The degree and the duration of the violence inflicted on [A] were important in assessing the Respondent\u2019s culpability (see [64] above). We have already pointed out that a high degree of violence and force was directed by the Respondent against [A]. On several occasions, [A] was already on the floor after being hit or pushed by the Respondent when she then proceeded to step on his knees, ribs or stomach. The extent of the force that she used was also clear. On the evening of the day when the fatal assaults took place, the Respondent choked [A] with her right hand and lifted him off the ground against the wall. She also pushed [A] on the chest on several occasions with such force that he fell and hit his head either on the ground (see the first and sixth charges) or against a television console table (see the third charge). In addition, in the assault in March 2012 (the subject matter of the sixth charge), the Respondent twisted and pulled [A]\u2019s hand so hard that, among other things, his left elbow was fractured. Apart from the viciousness of the violence inflicted on [A], the abuse in 2014 was protracted and occurred over a sustained period from June until 1 August 2014.",
      "123": "Not only did the Respondent\u2019s heinous and violent conduct cause the death of a helpless child, the post-mortem examination of [A] revealed, in addition to the fatal head injury (arising from six discrete impact sites on the head), 43 other external injuries to [A]. Four of them were old scars on his forehead, chin, head and neck. The rest were recent injuries consisting of abrasions and bruises all over [A]\u2019s body \u2013 on his forehead, chin, jaw, scalp, ears, neck, shoulder, chest, back, arms, hands, knees and left foot. Five areas of internal haemorrhage were also found in his tissues. The pain suffered by [A] must have been unspeakably severe. The extreme degree of violence and force that the Respondent inflicted on her defenceless son did not appear to have been given sufficient consideration by the Judge: nothing was said in the GD about the viciousness of the Respondent\u2019s acts of abuse or the severity of the injuries suffered by [A].",
      "124": "Lastly, the prior intervention of the CPS in between the episodes of abuse in March 2012 and 2014 was also an aggravating factor (see [70] above). The Respondent had previously been investigated for inflicting non-accidental injuries on [A], and it was barely a few months after [A]\u2019s case was closed by the CPS on 5 February 2014 (see [11] above) that the Respondent started to ill-treat [A] again in June 2014. Yet, the Judge did not seem to have regarded this as an aggravating factor at all.",
      "125": "Having considered the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors in the present case, we turn now to the appropriate sentences for the various charges against the Respondent. We first deal with the two charges under s 325 of the Penal Code, the first and sixth charges.",
      "126": "For the first charge, given that the grievous hurt caused took the form of death, we were satisfied that the appropriate imprisonment sentence should be at the high end of the prescribed range. Based on the guidelines which we set out earlier (at [56] above), the indicative starting point is a sentence of around eight years\u2019 imprisonment. In our view, this should be adjusted upwards to nine years\u2019 imprisonment in this case, taking into account the Respondent\u2019s high degree of culpability as well as the various aggravating factors that we identified at [118]\u2013[122] above. In particular, we took into account (a) the Respondent\u2019s position as the mother of [A]; (b) the extreme youth of [A]; (c) the viciousness of the violence inflicted; and (d) the extended period of time over which the events on 1 August 2014 unfolded.",
      "127": "Further, in calibrating the appropriate sentence, we considered it relevant to have regard to the fact that the Respondent would not be caned by virtue of s 325(1)(a) of the CPC. The Prosecution had highlighted in the court below that imprisonment coupled with between six and 12 strokes of the cane had previously been imposed in grievous hurt cases where the victim either died or suffered \u201cvery serious injuries\u201d. Although the Prosecution sought an enhancement of the Respondent\u2019s imprisonment sentence in lieu of caning, the Judge did not address this.",
      "128": "As the Respondent was exempted from caning, the Judge was empowered to enhance her sentence by up to a maximum of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment under s 325(2) of the CPC. In Amin ([76] supra), a three-judge panel of the High Court set out the approach to be taken by a court when determining whether an offender\u2019s sentence should be enhanced by reason of the offender\u2019s exemption from caning, and if so, how the extent of such enhancement should be determined.",
      "129": "In the present case, we considered that there were grounds for such enhancement. As a woman, the Respondent would have known that she fell into one of the categories of offenders exempted from caning. Moreover, we considered that the sentencing principles of both deterrence and retribution featured significantly in this case as it involved grave violence against a young victim who died from the injuries inflicted. In the circumstances, we were satisfied that an additional term of imprisonment was called for to compensate for the lost deterrent effect of caning (see Amin at [67]).",
      "130": "Earlier, we stated that in fatal cases prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code, a sentence of 12 or more strokes of the cane may be warranted (see [76] above). In the light of the substantial aggravating factors which featured in this case and which we have already recounted (such as the extreme youth of [A], the fact that the Respondent was his biological mother and the Respondent\u2019s vicious cruelty towards a defenceless child), we would have imposed 14 strokes of the cane on the Respondent if she had not been exempted from caning under s 325(1)(a) of the CPC. Based on the indicative guidelines provided in Amin (at [90]), an additional term of imprisonment of between six and nine months was called for. In the circumstances, we were of the view that an enhancement of the Respondent\u2019s imprisonment sentence for the first charge by six months was warranted. We therefore increased the imprisonment sentence for this charge from seven years to nine years and six months.",
      "131": "As for the sixth charge, we increased the sentence from two years\u2019 imprisonment to four years\u2019 imprisonment. We earlier stated that the indicative starting point for offences prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code involving non-fatal serious injuries and multiple fractures of the type and gravity encountered in this case is an imprisonment term of around three years and six months (see [56] above). We were of the view that this should be adjusted upwards in the Respondent\u2019s case to four years\u2019 imprisonment given the aggravating factors present.",
      "132": "In relation to the sixth charge, the violence inflicted on [A], who was merely two years and five months old then, was, as we stated at [112] above, unjustified and vicious. [A]\u2019s injuries after this first reported instance of abuse in 2012 were serious: he was found to have multiple fractures (on his left elbow, left calf and right eighth to eleventh ribs), haematomas on his forehead and the back of his head, various small healing bruises on various parts of his body, as well as other healed linear scars on his lower legs and lower abdomen (see [9] above). Further, the especially young age of [A] at that time was a relevant consideration.",
      "133": "We turn to the third and fourth charges for ill-treating [A], which were brought under s 5(1) of the CYPA and punishable under s 5(5)(b) of that Act.",
      "134": "We decided not to disturb the sentences imposed for these two charges because, in our judgment, the agreed statement of facts did not allow us to draw any conclusion as to the precise nature and seriousness of the injuries that were inflicted on [A] in relation to these charges. There were no accompanying medical reports or details of these injuries. As we pointed out earlier, the sentence imposed must be sensitive to the facts of the case and should reflect a proper appreciation of all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the harm caused and the seriousness and permanence of the injuries inflicted. In the absence of detailed information on these matters, we decided that the sentences imposed by the Judge for the third and fourth charges should not be disturbed.",
      "135": "With regard to the aggregate sentence, we were satisfied that in the present circumstances, the Prosecution was correct to urge us to order the sentences for the first, fourth and sixth charges to run consecutively so as to make an aggregate sentence of 14 years and six months\u2019 imprisonment.",
      "136": "Ordering the sentences for these three charges to run consecutively would be in line with the one-transaction rule and the totality principle (see Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP [2014] 2 SLR 998 (\u201cShouffee\u201d) at [25]). Where the one-transaction rule is concerned, these three charges involved distinct offences. The acts of abuse which formed the subject matter of these charges were committed on different days, with the first and sixth offences committed almost two and a half years apart, and the CPS was involved in the intervening period.",
      "137": "As for the totality principle, the first limb of this principle examines whether \u201cthe aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed\u201d [emphasis in original]: see Shouffee at [54], citing Prof D A Thomas, Principles of Sentencing (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979) at pp 57\u201358. In Haliffie bin Mamat v PP [2016] 5 SLR 636, we clarified (at [79]) that in determining the \u201cnormal level\u201d of sentences for this purpose, the court should look at the range of sentences normally imposed for the most serious of the individual offences rather than a specific sentencing benchmark or starting point. With regard to the second limb of the totality principle, this assesses whether the effect of the aggregate sentence is \u201ccrushing and not in keeping with [the offender\u2019s] past record and ... future prospects\u201d (see Shouffee at [57]).",
      "138": "In our judgment, the imposition of consecutive sentences for the first, fourth and sixth charges against the Respondent, with an aggregate sentence of 14 years and six months\u2019 imprisonment, was, on the whole, proportionate to the gravity of her offences and her high degree of culpability. As we indicated at [56] above, the normal imprisonment sentence for a fatal case prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code should range from the indicative starting point of around eight years\u2019 imprisonment to, in the worst category of cases, the maximum term of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. An aggregate imprisonment sentence of 14 years and six months in the Respondent\u2019s case was hence not so much higher than the relevant range as to render it \u201ccrushing\u201d.",
      "139": "For these reasons, we allowed the Prosecution\u2019s appeal, and enhanced the sentence for the first charge to nine years and six months\u2019 imprisonment and the sentence for the sixth charge to four years\u2019 imprisonment. We left the sentences for the third and fourth charges undisturbed at six months\u2019 and a year\u2019s imprisonment respectively.",
      "140": "We also ordered the sentences for the first, fourth and sixth charges to run consecutively, and the sentence for the third charge to run concurrently. This resulted in an aggregate sentence of 14 years and six months\u2019 imprisonment, backdated to 2 August 2014, the date of the Respondent\u2019s arrest.",
      "141": "The law has always taken a strong stance on crimes against vulnerable victims. Our courts condemn such offences by considering the victim\u2019s vulnerability to be an aggravating factor which is relevant for sentencing purposes. This, however, may not be sufficient. We therefore invite Parliament to consider affording the courts the power, when dealing with such offences, in particular, those against children and young persons, to enhance the permitted punishment to one and a half times the prescribed maximum penalty for certain offences.",
      "142": "This approach of enhancing the permitted sentencing range by enacting legislation that identifies a certain class of criminal action as deserving of harsher punishment than similar criminal conduct is not new. Parliament has enacted such legislation in relation to certain offences against foreign domestic workers (for instance, voluntarily causing either hurt or grievous hurt to, or wrongfully confining such workers) in order to send a clear signal to employers that the Government takes a serious view of foreign domestic worker abuse: see s 73 of the Penal Code and Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (20 April 1998) vol 68 at cols 1923\u20131925. Parliament made this legislative amendment because foreign domestic workers were recognised as being \u201cmore vulnerable to abuse\u201d by employers and their immediate family members, and because the number of such cases of abuse had been on the rise.",
      "143": "A similar regime of enhanced penalties has also been imposed for racially or religiously aggravated offences: see s 74 of the Penal Code and Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (22 October 2007) vol 83 at col 2183.",
      "144": "Recently, the MSF conducted a public consultation on a draft Vulnerable Adults Bill which proposed (among other things) inserting a new s 74A in the Penal Code to provide for enhanced penalties of up to one and a half times the permitted sentencing range for certain offences against vulnerable adults. Vulnerable adults are defined in this draft Bill as individuals who are (a) 18 years of age or older; and (b) unable, by reason of mental or physical infirmity, disability or incapacity, to protect themselves from abuse, neglect or self-neglect. This proposed change is entirely consistent with our call for the courts to be afforded the discretion to enhance sentences for certain offences against vulnerable victims, especially children and young persons.",
      "145": "In the present case, if there had been such a provision affording us this discretion, we would not have hesitated to enhance the Respondent\u2019s sentence for the first charge by one and a half times given the gravity of that offence and the significant aggravating factors present."

      "1": "Micheal Anak Garing (\u201cMAG\u201d) and Tony Anak Imba (\u201cTAI\u201d) were both tried in the High Court under s 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for the murder of one Shanmuganathan Dillidurai (\u201cthe deceased\u201d). They were both charged with murder committed in furtherance of a common intention, and were thus liable to be punished under s 302(2) read with s 34 of the Penal Code.",
      "2": "MAG and TAI, together with two other friends, Hairee Anak Landak (\u201cHAL\u201d) and Donny Anak Meluda (\u201cDAM\u201d) (collectively, \u201cthe Gang\u201d), had set out from a friend\u2019s house on the night of 29 May 2010 with a preconceived plan to commit robbery. One of them was armed with a deadly weapon, a parang. Over the course of that night and the wee hours of the following day, the Gang attacked the deceased and inflicted the injuries which eventually led to his death. It transpired that the deceased was not the only person whom the Gang attacked that night. Prior to attacking the deceased, the Gang had set upon three other victims in order to rob them. Fortunately, none of those other victims succumbed to their injuries. For the attacks on those three victims, MAG and TAI each faced three charges (one in relation to each victim) of robbery while one or more of the Gang was armed with a deadly weapon which came to be used to cause hurt to the three victims, an offence punishable under s 394 read with s 397 of the Penal Code. Those charges were stood down at the trial.",
      "3": "The High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) convicted both MAG and TAI of their respective murder charges (see PP v Micheal Anak Garing [2014] SGHC 13 (\u201cthe Judgment on Conviction\u201d)). Given the amendments made to the Penal Code by the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 32 of 2012), which came into effect on 1 January 2013, the Judge had the discretion to impose either the death penalty or life imprisonment with caning. The Judge sentenced MAG to suffer the death penalty, and sentenced TAI to life imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane (see PP v Micheal Anak Garing [2015] SGHC 107 (\u201cthe Judgment on Sentence\u201d)).",
      "4": "Criminal Appeal No 9 of 2015 (\u201cCCA 9\u201d) is MAG\u2019s appeal against his conviction on the murder charge and the death penalty imposed on him. MAG contends that his conviction should be overturned; alternatively, if the conviction were ordered to stand, the matter should be remitted to the Judge to reconsider the sentence meted out as the Judge erred in principle in sentencing him to suffer the death penalty. Criminal Appeal No 11 of 2015 (\u201cCCA 11\u201d) is the Prosecution\u2019s appeal against the Judge\u2019s decision to sentence TAI to life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. The Prosecution contends that the death penalty should similarly have been imposed on TAI. For completeness, we should mention that TAI initially filed Criminal Appeal No 24 of 2015 (\u201cCCA 24\u201d) against his conviction on the murder charge and his sentence, but subsequently withdrew this appeal.",
      "5": "Before we outline the background facts, we shall first deal with a preliminary issue that was brought up at the hearing of these appeals.",
      "6": "The preliminary issue concerns the relevance and, in turn, the admissibility of the evidence relating to the first three attacks perpetrated by the Gang. Counsel for MAG, Mr Ramesh Tiwary (\u201cMr Tiwary\u201d), submits that this evidence should not be admitted because it is prejudicial to both MAG and TAI.",
      "7": "At the trial, a similar objection was raised before the Judge. The Judge ruled that the evidence concerning the three earlier attacks was admissible because those attacks formed part of the \u201ccrucial narrative\u201d leading up to the commission of the offence in respect of which MAG and TAI were being tried. The Judge further opined that while each of those three attacks could be seen as an isolated incident, together, they formed \u201can integral act pursuant to a common intention to assault and rob\u201d. The prejudicial effect of the evidence thus did not outweigh its probative value (at [2] of the Judgment on Conviction).",
      "8": "In our view, the Judge was plainly correct in admitting the aforesaid evidence. It cannot be denied that this evidence was prejudicial to both MAG and TAI in that it disclosed the commission of offences which were violent in nature. However, in determining the admissibility of evidence, the purpose for which the evidence is sought to be admitted is vital (see Tan Meng Jee v PP [1996] 2 SLR(R) 178 at [37]; PP v Purushothaman a/l Subramaniam [2014] SGHC 215 at [60]). If the Prosecution seeks to admit evidence for the purpose of showing an accused person\u2019s violent tendencies, such evidence would be unduly prejudicial and therefore inadmissible (see Makin v Attorney General for New South Wales [1894] AC 57). However, as can be seen from [7] above, this was not the basis on which the Judge admitted the evidence relating to the three earlier attacks.",
      "9": "Section 6 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) provides that facts which are not in issue but which are nevertheless \u201cso connected with a fact in issue as to form part of the same transaction\u201d are relevant. A good illustration of this rule can be found in the case of O\u2019Leary v R (1946) 73 CLR 566. In that case, the High Court of Australia ruled on the admissibility of evidence of assaults committed by the appellant on different persons prior to his killing of one Ballard, for which the appellant was charged with murder. Latham CJ, Rich, Dixon and Williams JJ (Starke and McTiernan JJ dissenting) held that the evidence relating to the prior assaults was admissible at the appellant\u2019s trial for murder as it disclosed a connected series of events which should be considered as one transaction. Dixon J explained his decision as follows (at 577):",
      "10": "In our view, the reasoning in O\u2019Leary v R applies to the present case with equal force. It would be artificial to reject evidence of what the Gang did during the period between leaving their friend\u2019s house on the night of 29 May 2010 and attacking the deceased. If this evidence were rejected, the court would have only a truncated version of the material events which might not shed true light on the attack carried out on the deceased, especially because all four attacks occurred within a short span of time. The evidence concerning the three earlier attacks is thus admissible as those attacks formed part of the same venture which the Gang agreed to undertake that night.",
      "11": "That evidence is also relevant as regards the state of mind of MAG and TAI. Section 14 of the Evidence Act provides that facts showing \u201cthe existence of any state of mind\u201d, including intention and knowledge, are relevant when the existence of such state of mind is in issue. Explanation 1 to s 14 makes it clear that the facts in question have to show that a state of mind exists \u201cnot generally but in reference to the particular matter in question\u201d. In the present case, both MAG and TAI were charged with committing murder in furtherance of a common intention. The attacks on the three victims that preceded the attack on the deceased are therefore highly material to the question of their state of mind at the time of the attack on the deceased. Moreover, as we shall elaborate, MAG\u2019s and TAI\u2019s knowledge of how each of them was likely to act in relation to the attack on the deceased has a material bearing on the question of sentence. In view of this, the evidence concerning those three attacks is relevant as evidence showing MAG\u2019s and TAI\u2019s state of mind at the time of the attack on the deceased.",
      "12": "For the above reasons, we agree with the Judge that the aforesaid evidence is admissible. With this preliminary issue disposed of, we turn to outline the material facts.",
      "13": "MAG and TAI, who are now aged 28 and 38 respectively, are Malaysians from Sarawak. As earlier mentioned, HAL and DAM were the other members of the Gang. HAL, who was the Prosecution\u2019s key witness in the court below, has already been convicted and sentenced for his role in the attacks. On 18 January 2013, he pleaded guilty to three charges of armed robbery with hurt, and was sentenced to 33 years\u2019 imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. DAM, on the other hand, has only recently been arrested and charged for his role in the attacks.",
      "14": "Sometime on 29 May 2010, the Gang were drinking at the house of a friend named Shaman in Geylang Lor 12. At some point during the night, the Gang resolved to leave the house and commit robbery. MAG armed himself with a parang, which he claimed he found in the house. DAM armed himself with a terepi, which is a tap handle.",
      "15": "After leaving Shaman\u2019s house, the Gang walked for ten to fifteen minutes until they reached a playground near Block 44 Sims Drive. There, they robbed one Sandeep Singh (\u201cSS\u201d). TAI initiated the attack on SS and the rest soon joined in. At some point during the attack, TAI used a brick to hit SS on the head. The attack lasted some two to three minutes. TAI robbed SS of his wallet and his mobile phone. As a result of the attack, SS sustained serious injuries, including slash wounds of various sizes, multiple open fractures of the metacarpal bones, lacerated tendons on the left hand and a fractured skull. The slash wounds on SS were so deep that the tendons beneath were exposed.",
      "16": "After attacking SS, the Gang walked for another ten to fifteen minutes towards Kallang MRT Station. There, they set their sights on one Ang Jun Heng (\u201cAng\u201d), who was walking along a path under the MRT track between Aljunied MRT Station and Kallang MRT Station. As a result of the attack, Ang suffered an amputation of his left hand with part of his palm and four fingers cut off. He also suffered a deep laceration down to the spine at the mid-cervical region. Had that laceration been any deeper, it would have reached his spinal cord. Ang was robbed of his mobile phone and his wallet. The assault on Ang similarly lasted about two to three minutes.",
      "17": "Roughly ten minutes later, after the Gang made their way to the footpath beside Kallang River (near Kallang MRT Station), they spotted one Egan Karruppaiah (\u201cEK\u201d) and assaulted him. EK suffered amputations of his left index finger, as well as his right index, middle, ring and little fingers. In addition, he suffered lacerations to his left wrist which went \u201cdown to [the] bone\u201d and fractures of his frontal sinus walls. Like SS and Ang, EK had his wallet and his mobile phone taken from him.",
      "18": "Approximately ten minutes later, while walking along Kallang Road near Riverine by the Park condominium, the Gang began their attack on the deceased, who was cycling on a footpath. Beside the footpath, there was an open field which was on slightly lower ground than the footpath. There was street lighting along the footpath, but not in the open field. TAI initiated the attack by approaching the deceased from his left and knocking him off his bicycle down the slope into the open field. It is from this point onwards that the accounts of the events provided by MAG, TAI and HAL (who testified for the Prosecution) begin to diverge. Their respective versions of the events are set out below (at [25]\u2013[33]). The deceased was robbed of his wallet.",
      "19": "For all four attacks, it was common ground that TAI was the initiator. DAM was the only one who used the terepi, while HAL was unarmed. It was also common ground that MAG used the parang for the first three attacks and for at least part of the attack on the deceased. Besides the parang and the terepi, no other weapon was used during the attacks.",
      "20": "The deceased was discovered by a security guard at about 7.30am on 30 May 2010. His body lay in the open field next to the footpath on which he had been cycling when he was attacked. Bloodstains were found on an electrical box located along the footpath near his body.",
      "21": "Dr Paul Chui (\u201cDr Chui\u201d), a forensic pathologist, performed the autopsy on the deceased. His unchallenged findings are that the deceased suffered at least 20 injuries. In his opinion, the following four injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death:\n(a)     An injury to the top of the head that fractured the deceased\u2019s skull. According to Dr Chui, this injury could have been caused by a bladed weapon coming down with sufficient force from over the top of the deceased\u2019s head, impacting the head from the left side, cutting the scalp and causing a fracture to the skull beneath.\n(b)     A wound to the neck that severed the jugular vein. This was a large gaping wound about 12cm long and 9cm wide running diagonally across the deceased\u2019s neck. It resulted in an almost complete severance of the airway. The deceased would have lost consciousness within a matter of seconds after sustaining this injury, and due to blood loss, death would have followed soon after.\n(c)     A wound to the back measuring 24.5cm long and 3.7cm wide. This wound penetrated the skin, subcutaneous fat and underlying muscles.\n(d)     An amputation of the left hand, resulting in four fingers and a significant part of the palm being completely cut off.",
      "22": "Apart from the above injuries, there was a cut to the deceased\u2019s left forearm which was deep enough to expose the underlying bone.",
      "23": "Dr Chui certified that the cause of death was the multiple injuries sustained, including the wound to the neck, the wound to the back (which resulted in a leak into the chest cavity) and the wound to the head that fractured the skull. Dr Chui also testified that these injuries could have been caused by a bladed weapon with force that was at least moderate.",
      "24": "Traces of MAG\u2019s DNA were found on five zipper heads of the deceased\u2019s black Campro Equipment waist pouch. MAG\u2019s and the deceased\u2019s DNA were also detected on the parang. The deceased\u2019s and Ang\u2019s blood were found on clothes worn by MAG. A red T-shirt worn by TAI during the attacks contained traces of Ang\u2019s blood. Additionally, the deceased\u2019s DNA was detected on a belt attached to a pair of jeans that were seized from TAI upon his arrest. The DNA was detected at the end of the belt away from the buckle. In his oral testimony at the trial, TAI was adamant that he had not been wearing a belt during the attack. He averred that the manner in which the investigators had collected the evidence had resulted in contamination.",
      "25": "We turn now to the various versions provided by the parties at the trial as to how the attack on the deceased occurred. As we indicated earlier (at [18] above), the Prosecution, MAG and TAI each put forth differing accounts. We begin with the Prosecution\u2019s version.",
      "26": "The Prosecution\u2019s case at the trial rested primarily on HAL\u2019s testimony. According to HAL, after TAI knocked the deceased off his bicycle, the deceased tried to flee, but TAI chased after him while MAG slashed him several times, inflicting the wounds on his back, his head and his left hand. TAI managed to grab hold of the deceased at around the spot where his body was eventually found. TAI held the deceased in an armlock while MAG continued slashing him, inflicting further injuries, including the fatal wound to the neck. After sustaining that injury, the deceased quickly lost consciousness and the Gang left the vicinity. The Prosecution\u2019s case was that MAG inflicted all the serious injuries suffered by the deceased, including the fatal injuries. TAI assisted MAG by holding the deceased in an armlock, and while in TAI\u2019s clutches, the deceased sustained the fatal injuries inflicted by MAG.",
      "27": "By contrast, MAG claimed that he did not inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased. According to him, TAI took the parang from him sometime during the attack on the deceased and he had no knowledge of what happened thereafter as he left the scene.",
      "28": "According to MAG, the deceased attempted to flee after TAI initiated the attack. TAI gave chase and started fighting with the deceased. MAG, HAL and DAM went towards them. MAG took out the parang and swung it over the deceased\u2019s head in order to scare him. No contact was made with the deceased as he dodged the blow. MAG then swung the parang again, making contact somewhere on the deceased\u2019s back. He swung the parang for a third and final time, making contact with the left hand of the deceased as the latter had raised it in an attempt to shield his head.",
      "29": "After the deceased was struck with the parang, he stopped fighting and sat down to try to control the pain. MAG opened the deceased\u2019s waist pouch and took his wallet. MAG claimed that after doing so, he made his way to the footpath and left the scene.",
      "30": "According to MAG\u2019s oral evidence at the trial, at the electrical box mentioned at [20] above, which was some 5\u201310m from where the deceased\u2019s body was later found, TAI snatched the parang from his left hand and returned to where the deceased was lying in the open field. MAG testified that he continued walking with HAL and DAM on the footpath, away from TAI and the deceased, towards Lavender Street. MAG only saw TAI later when the latter caught up with the other members of the Gang at a traffic light further down the footpath near an Indian temple, a spot more than 200m from where the deceased lay.",
      "31": "MAG claimed that he had no knowledge of how the fatal injuries came to be inflicted on the deceased as he left the scene after TAI snatched the parang from him at or near the aforesaid electrical box.",
      "32": "As TAI has decided not to proceed with his appeal in CCA 24 against his conviction and sentence (see [4] above), his defence at the trial is not of particular relevance for the purposes of the present appeals. Nevertheless, for completeness, we shall briefly outline his version of the events.",
      "33": "TAI\u2019s oral testimony at the trial was that in relation to the attack on the deceased, he only had the intention to rob. He claimed that before the attack on the deceased, he reprimanded MAG multiple times for using the parang. TAI averred that during MAG\u2019s attack on EK with the parang, the parang came into contact with his hand. According to TAI, after he initiated the attack on the deceased, the latter became pinned under his bicycle. MAG then moved in, stepped on the bicycle and swung the parang at the deceased. The deceased broke free and attempted to flee, whereupon TAI gave chase. But before he could reach the deceased, HAL kicked the deceased in the ribs. TAI claimed that from that point onwards, he did not continue in the attack on the deceased. He shouted at MAG to stop attacking the deceased with the parang and to just take the deceased\u2019s wallet, but MAG did not pay any heed. TAI then grabbed HAL by the hand and they left the scene.",
      "34": "TAI testified that at no point during the attack on the deceased did he wield the parang. Further, and contrary to the Prosecution\u2019s case, he claimed that he never held on to the deceased while MAG inflicted the fatal injuries on the deceased with the parang.",
      "35": "In convicting both MAG and TAI of murder committed in furtherance of a common intention, the Judge found that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt its case against both of them. The Judge held that the discrepancies in what MAG said TAI did with the parang and where TAI took it from him were not helpful to his defence. In this regard, the Judge noted that both HAL\u2019s and TAI\u2019s evidence consistently pointed towards MAG as the one who had used the parang on the deceased. In the Judge\u2019s view, the attack on the deceased and the earlier attacks on the other three victims \u201ctook place as if the [G]ang were on a safari, hunting down one prey at a time, using the same method to trap and harm their victims\u201d (at [8] of the Judgment on Conviction). In these circumstances, the Judge opined, it did not matter who had used the parang on the deceased. He was, however, satisfied based on the evidence that it was MAG who had struck the deceased with the parang (at [8] of the Judgment on Conviction).",
      "36": "With regard to TAI, the Judge reasoned that TAI could not have been oblivious to the fact that MAG had slashed the earlier three victims before the fatal attack on the deceased. Therefore, TAI could not say that he had not intended to join in the attack on the deceased with the parang and had only agreed or intended to rob. The Judge was thus satisfied that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt its case that TAI acted in furtherance of a common intention with MAG not only to rob, but also to cause injuries to the deceased with the parang (at [9] of the Judgment on Conviction).",
      "37": "In respect of sentence, the Judge sentenced MAG to suffer death because he was satisfied that it was MAG who had used the parang to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased. The Judge did not, however, agree with the Prosecution\u2019s submission that the death penalty should likewise be imposed on TAI. He exercised his discretion to sentence TAI to life imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane. The Judge held that TAI\u2019s culpability differed sufficiently from MAG\u2019s because TAI had not used the parang to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased.",
      "38": "In CCA 9, Mr Tiwary submits that the Judge erred in finding that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt the charge against MAG. Mr Tiwary argues that HAL\u2019s testimony, which formed the plank of the Prosecution\u2019s entire case against MAG at the trial, was \u201criddled\u201d with so many inconsistencies that it was unsafe to rely on that evidence alone to prove the Prosecution\u2019s case that MAG used the parang to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased. Mr Tiwary contends that because of the unreliability of HAL\u2019s evidence, MAG\u2019s defence raises a reasonable doubt as to whether he did in fact use the parang to inflict the injuries on the deceased. Mr Tiwary further submits that MAG cannot be held criminally liable for the injuries inflicted by TAI after MAG left the open field (see MAG\u2019s version of the events at [28]\u2013[30] above), and therefore, MAG\u2019s conviction on the murder charge should be set aside.",
      "39": "With regard to sentence, Mr Tiwary argues that even if MAG\u2019s conviction for murder is ordered to stand, the matter should be remitted to the Judge for him to reconsider the sentence. Mr Tiwary submits that the Judge erred in principle in sentencing MAG to death because in doing so, he took into account the evidence concerning the earlier attacks on the other three victims. The Judge, Mr Tiwary argues, should have disregarded that evidence because the charges relating to those three attacks were stood down at the trial and MAG was to be sentenced only for the attack on the deceased. As the Judge erroneously took into account that evidence, the sentence of death imposed on MAG should be quashed and the matter remitted to the Judge for him to reconsider the sentence.",
      "40": "In CCA 11, the Prosecution submits that the Judge erred in sentencing TAI to life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane instead of imposing the death penalty. The Prosecution says that the present case is unique for its extreme violence. In the Prosecution\u2019s view, the Judge erred in drawing a distinction between MAG\u2019s culpability and TAI\u2019s culpability for sentencing purposes on the sole basis that TAI had not wielded the parang. The fact that TAI was convicted of committing murder in furtherance of a common intention made it immaterial that he had not wielded the murder weapon because criminal liability was attributed on the basis of his common intention. As an offender who had not wielded the murder weapon, TAI\u2019s state of mind, the Prosecution submits, \u201cwould be of paramount importance\u201d in assessing the extent of his culpability.",
      "41": "The Prosecution further argues that TAI\u2019s conduct right from the very beginning of the attacks demonstrated a blatant disregard for human life. TAI actively participated in the highly brutal attacks, and even held the deceased in an armlock while MAG slashed him with the parang. The Prosecution contends that where an \u201coffender acts to ambush, chase down, and restrain the victim, knowing full well that the victim would be mercilessly slashed as a result, and the victim dies through the infliction of such injuries\u201d, there is no reason in principle why this offender should receive a lighter sentence than the offender who in fact mercilessly slashed the victim.",
      "42": "We shall first consider MAG\u2019s appeal in CCA 9 against his conviction and sentence before turning to the Prosecution\u2019s appeal in CCA 11 against TAI\u2019s sentence.",
      "43": "We earlier outlined (at [37] above) Mr Tiwary\u2019s argument that HAL\u2019s evidence was inconsistent in so many respects that it could not, alone, satisfy the Prosecution\u2019s burden of showing beyond reasonable doubt that MAG had used the parang to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased. The inconsistencies in HAL\u2019s evidence that Mr Tiwary relies on are as follows:\n(a)     When testifying in court, HAL was adamant that a brick had been used only on SS (see [15] above) and that no brick had been used to hit the deceased. However, in a statement which HAL made to the police on 2 June 2010, he said that the deceased had been hit by TAI on the head with a brick. HAL admitted on the witness stand that his account to the police was wrong even though his memory at the time he gave his 2 June 2010 statement would have been fresher than when he was giving evidence in court.\n(b)     In court, HAL said that the deceased had been cycling on the footpath when TAI commenced the attack. Yet, in his 2 June 2010 statement, he told the police that the deceased had been sitting on the pavement talking on his mobile phone at that time.\n(c)     In court, HAL testified that he first saw the deceased after crossing Kallang Road. But, in his statement to the police on 4 June 2010, he told the police that he saw the deceased first and then crossed the road.\n(d)     In court, HAL said that DAM had been behind him while MAG and TAI had been in front of him when he crossed Kallang Road. Yet, in his 4 June 2010 statement to the police, he clearly stated that he had been the last to cross the road.\n(e)     HAL\u2019s evidence in court was that TAI initiated the assault on the deceased by elbowing the deceased and knocking him off his bicycle. Yet, in the statement of facts which HAL admitted to without qualification at his criminal mention (\u201cthe Statement of Facts\u201d), it was stated that TAI had kicked (rather than elbowed) the deceased.\n(f)     In court, HAL said that he had only punched the deceased during the attack. Yet, the Statement of Facts stated that HAL had punched and kicked the deceased. Further, HAL agreed on the witness stand that he had admitted to the Statement of Facts because it was convenient for him.\n(g)     In court, HAL said that he only knew that the deceased was going to be the next victim after TAI had elbowed the deceased. However, in one of his statements to the police, he said that he knew the deceased was going to be the next victim even before TAI commenced the attack. When confronted with this discrepancy, HAL changed his evidence in court and adopted what he had earlier told the police.\n(h)     In court, HAL claimed that he saw TAI dragging the deceased right after TAI knocked the deceased off the bicycle. Yet, in his 4 June 2010 statement to the police, HAL said that either TAI or MAG had dragged the deceased, while his version in the Statement of Facts was that both TAI and MAG had dragged the deceased.\n(i)     In court, HAL said that he did not know MAG had a parang with him when the Gang left Shaman\u2019s house in Geylang Lor 12, but in the Statement of Facts, he admitted that he was aware that MAG had brought a parang along.\n(j)     In court, HAL testified that he did not see the wounds which MAG inflicted on the deceased with the parang. Yet, HAL had punched the deceased after MAG had used the parang on the deceased several times, which meant that HAL had been at arm\u2019s length at that time and should therefore have seen the wounds. Further, in his statement to the police on 7 June 2010, HAL said that MAG had bent down and used the parang to \u201cpotong\u201d the deceased, suggesting that he had seen the parang making contact with the deceased.\n(k)     In court, HAL said that after he punched the deceased, MAG continued hitting the deceased with the parang several times. However, in his statement to the police on 7 June 2010, HAL said that MAG hit the deceased with the parang only once.\n(l)     In court, HAL said that MAG and TAI had an argument over the deceased\u2019s wallet before the Gang reached a bus stop in the vicinity of the scene of the attack. However, in his 4 June 2010 statement to the police, he told the police that no one had said anything at all about the deceased\u2019s wallet on the way back to Syed Alwi Road, while in his 7 June 2010 statement, he said that the argument had occurred after the Gang reached the bus stop.",
      "44": "We note the discrepancies in HAL\u2019s evidence which Mr Tiwary has pointed out. However, we do not think these discrepancies necessarily show that HAL\u2019s testimony in relation to who used the parang to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased was unreliable. The crucial factual issue that concerned the Judge and that likewise concerns this court on appeal is who used the parang to inflict the fatal blows. HAL was consistent in all his accounts, whether in court, in his statements to the police or even in the Statement of Facts \u2013 he consistently pointed to MAG as the only person who wielded the parang. At no point did HAL say, as MAG would have us believe (see [29] above), that TAI took or snatched the parang from MAG. In our view, the discrepancies raised by Mr Tiwary fail to cast any reasonable doubt on this critical aspect of HAL\u2019s evidence. At best, the discrepancies cast doubt on the penumbra and not the core of HAL\u2019s evidence, which is that MAG alone wielded the parang. Moreover, as the Judge observed, HAL\u2019s evidence on this issue was consistent with TAI\u2019s evidence (see the Judgment on Conviction at [7]). There was no reason or obvious motive for HAL to lend support to TAI at the trial given that by then, HAL had already been fully dealt with for his role in the attacks. It is also vital, in considering the discrepancies in HAL\u2019s evidence highlighted by Mr Tiwary, to bear in mind that HAL was recalling events which occurred in a fast and furious manner. For these reasons, we find that the discrepancies raised by Mr Tiwary do not meet the threshold for appellate intervention in relation to findings of fact made by a trial judge (see PP v Muhammad Farid bin Mohd Yusop [2015] 3 SLR 16 at [54]).",
      "45": "Indeed, we are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that MAG was the one who inflicted all the fatal injuries on the deceased with the parang. MAG accepts that he wielded the parang for the first three attacks and for part of the attack on the deceased. The critical part of his defence is that sometime during the attack on the deceased, TAI snatched the parang from him. MAG, however, provided inconsistent accounts as to where and when the parang was taken from him, and whether he saw TAI use the parang on the deceased.",
      "46": "In a contemporaneous statement which MAG provided, he said that the parang was taken from him during the attack on the deceased, and after the parang was taken from him, he proceeded to check the deceased\u2019s waist pouch. In court, however, he claimed that TAI snatched the parang from him near the electrical box after he left the open field and checked the deceased\u2019s waist pouch. Further, in his 4 June 2010 statement to the police, MAG said that TAI snatched the parang from him and shouted \u201cserigala\u201d (the Malay word for \u201cwolf\u201d) \u201cwhile running to toward [sic] the man and kicking him\u201d [emphasis added]. This suggests that MAG saw TAI attacking the deceased with the parang. Similarly, in his cautioned statement, MAG said that TAI snatched the parang from him and hit the deceased, again suggesting that he saw TAI attacking the deceased with the parang. This is diametrically opposed to what he said in court, when he testified that he did not see TAI using the parang on the deceased. MAG\u2019s explanation in court as to what he meant in his earlier statements \u2013 namely, that he had merely assumed TAI was going to hit the deceased with the parang after TAI snatched it away from him because TAI shouted \u201cserigala\u201d while running towards the deceased \u2013 went against what was stated in those statements. In our judgment, these are material discrepancies (unlike the discrepancies raised by Mr Tiwary in relation to HAL\u2019s evidence) which severely undermine MAG\u2019s defence. Whether or not MAG saw TAI using the parang on the deceased in what (if TAI had indeed attacked the deceased as MAG alleged) would have been a brutal attack, given the injuries found on the deceased, was not something one could easily mix up. Further, the allegation that the parang changed hands during the attack on the deceased is central to MAG\u2019s defence, but MAG could not provide a consistent account of the location where the parang was allegedly taken from him. This again undermines his claim that TAI snatched the parang from him during the attack.",
      "47": "Considering all the circumstances, we are satisfied that the Prosecution did prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was MAG who used the parang to inflict the fatal blows on the deceased. As MAG\u2019s appeal against conviction rests solely on the ground that he did not strike the deceased with the parang and cause the fatal injuries, our finding above is sufficient to dispose of his appeal against conviction. We thus dismiss this aspect of his appeal in CCA 9.",
      "48": "Given that MAG was convicted of murder under s 300(c) of the Penal Code, he was liable to be sentenced under s 302(2), as opposed to s 302(1), of the Penal Code. The principles in relation to the imposition of the discretionary death penalty under s 302(2) were thoroughly considered by this court in PP v Kho Jabing [2015] 2 SLR 112 (\u201cKho Jabing (Re-sentencing)\u201d). In that case, we unanimously held that the test for determining whether to impose the death penalty in this context is whether the actions of the offender would outrage the feelings of the community (at [44]). We further elaborated that the death penalty would be appropriate in cases where the offender had acted in a way which exhibited viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life (at [45]).",
      "49": "In Kho Jabing (Re-sentencing), the majority relied on three critical factors in deciding to impose the death penalty on the offender (see Kho Jabing v PP [2016] 3 SLR 135 (\u201cKho Jabing (Criminal Motion)\u201d) at [100]), namely:\n(a)     the offender first struck the victim on the head from behind without warning, causing the latter to fall to the ground (see Kho Jabing (Re-sentencing) at [71(a)]);\n(b)     the offender inflicted at least one more blow on the victim while the latter was lying defenceless on the ground (see Kho Jabing (Re-sentencing) at [71(b)]); and\n(c)     even if the offender had inflicted only two blows on the victim, it would be fair to infer that those two blows must have been of such force that they caused extensive fractures to the victim\u2019s skull and weakened it to the extent that the strike which the offender\u2019s co-accused dealt to the victim with a belt buckle and/or the deceased\u2019s fall to the ground could have caused further fracturing when, ordinarily, they would not have had such an effect (see Kho Jabing (Re-sentencing) at [67]\u2013[68], [71(c)] and [78]).",
      "50": "In our judgment, MAG did act in blatant disregard for human life in the attack on the deceased. In Kho Jabing (Re-sentencing), the offender used a piece of wood to strike the victim\u2019s head with great force. Here, MAG used a 58cm long parang to slash the deceased. He struck the deceased with it on the top of his head with such force that it caused a fracture to the skull, and he also slit the deceased\u2019s throat. MAG\u2019s assault on the deceased was a vicious, savage and sustained onslaught. He swung the blade violently at different areas of the deceased\u2019s body and eventually cut the deceased\u2019s throat. The sheer brutality exhibited by MAG warrants the imposition of the death penalty \u2013 it seems to us that MAG attacked the deceased in a totally savage and merciless manner as though he were attacking a hunted prey.",
      "51": "We now deal briefly with Mr Tiwary\u2019s submission that in sentencing MAG, the Judge erroneously took into account the evidence concerning the three earlier attacks on the other victims. While it may appear that the Judge took that evidence into account for sentencing purposes (see the Judgment on Sentence at [11]), we do not think he in fact did so. The Judge merely opined, in response to Mr Tiwary\u2019s submission that the evidence relating to those attacks should be disregarded, that that evidence could not be ignored because it was \u201crelevant to the [P]rosecution\u2019s narrative\u201d. In our view, the Judge did not actually take that evidence into account when he sentenced MAG.",
      "52": "In any event, even if the Judge did err in taking into account the evidence concerning the three earlier attacks, we are satisfied, for the reasons stated above, that considering only the manner in which MAG attacked the deceased, the imposition of the death penalty is amply warranted because of the sheer viciousness of the attack. Accordingly, we also dismiss that part of MAG\u2019s appeal in CCA 9 relating to sentence.",
      "53": "We turn now to the Prosecution\u2019s appeal in CCA 11 against TAI\u2019s sentence. The Prosecution submits that this is the first case in which the imposition of the discretionary death penalty falls to be considered in respect of a secondary offender, ie, an offender who did not inflict the fatal blow on the victim. In our view, there is no reason why the principles laid down by this court in Kho Jabing (Re-sentencing) (see [47] above) should not equally apply to a secondary offender. In Kho Jabing (Criminal Motion), we elaborated (at [89]) that the test of whether an offender\u2019s actions \u201coutrage the feelings of the community\u201d is a \u201creasoned normative standard which future courts are to apply\u201d [emphasis in original]. We further explained as follows (at [90]):",
      "54": "Bearing in mind these considerations, we deal first with the Prosecution\u2019s submission that TAI and MAG bore equal culpability for the deceased\u2019s death because they were convicted on the basis of their shared common intention to commit murder under s 300(c) read with s 34 of the Penal Code. In our view, s 34 equates the culpability of a principal offender with that of a secondary offender for the purposes of determining criminal liability. Section 34, however, does not equate the principal offender\u2019s and the secondary offender\u2019s culpability for the purposes of sentencing, where principles of (inter alia) and the personal circumstances of each offender are to be taken into account. The cases which the Prosecution relies on to support its submission on this point \u2013 namely, the High Court decision of Er Joo Nguang v PP [2000] 1 SLR(R) 756 and our decision in PP v Leong Soon Kheong [2009] 4 SLR(R) 63 (\u201cLeong Soon Kheong\u201d) \u2013 do not assist the Prosecution because they merely stand for the proposition that a principal offender and a secondary offender may be regarded as bearing the same culpability for sentencing purposes. Indeed, these two decisions stand for the proposition that all the circumstances of the case must be considered, and it does not necessarily follow that a secondary offender always bears a lower degree of culpability than a primary offender simply because the former did not participate in the physical attack on the victim. This point is exemplified by the following passage in Leong Soon Kheong (at [36]\u2013[37]):",
      "55": "In our judgment, in deciding for sentencing purposes whether a secondary offender acted in blatant disregard for human life, two particular factors are relevant: (a) the mental state of the offender at the time of the attack; and (b) his actual role or participation in the attack. It is the confluence of both factors, without one assuming a greater importance than the other, which ultimately determines whether the offender acted in blatant disregard for human life. We cannot but stress the importance of considering all the factual circumstances of each case. We should also clarify that the mere fact that an offender did not inflict the fatal blows does not necessarily mean that the death penalty would therefore be unwarranted. The Judge himself recognised this (see the Judgment on Sentence at [13]). With these considerations in mind, we turn to the facts pertinent to CCA 11, beginning with TAI\u2019s mental state at the time of the attack on the deceased.",
      "56": "TAI does not dispute that at the very minimum, he had the intention to inflict on the deceased injury of the type specified in s 300(c) of the Penal Code (\u201cs 300(c) injury\u201d) as otherwise, criminal liability would not have attached to him in the first place (see Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan v PP [2010] 4 SLR 1119 at [167]; Kho Jabing v PP [2011] 3 SLR 634 at [32]\u2013[33]). It follows that in every case where a secondary offender is held liable for murder committed in furtherance of a common intention under s 300(c) read with s 34, this mental element of intending to inflict s 300(c) injury is necessarily present. A sentencing court must be cognisant of this and guard against placing too much emphasis on the secondary offender\u2019s common intention because that common intention results in the imposition of criminal liability in the first place. In such cases, where the mental element on the part of the secondary offender is merely the common intention to inflict s 300(c) injury without more, greater focus should be placed on the secondary offender\u2019s actual role in the attack in determining the appropriate sentence.",
      "57": "In our judgment, TAI\u2019s mental state went beyond the minimum required for a conviction of murder committed in furtherance of a common intention under s 300(c) read with s 34. Not only did TAI have the common intention to inflict s 300(c) injury on the deceased, he also knew that MAG would in all likelihood wield the parang indiscriminately when attacking the deceased. While there was no preconceived plan to kill the deceased by using the parang in a savage and merciless manner, TAI knew that MAG would in all likelihood do so as he had seen how MAG had used the parang indiscriminately on the earlier three victims. We do not accept that TAI did not know the extent of the injuries suffered by those victims, or that he did not know MAG would use the parang on the deceased. MAG had used the parang on all the earlier three victims despite TAI claiming that he told MAG not to, and there was nothing to suggest that MAG was going to behave differently in respect of the attack on the deceased.",
      "58": "Turning to TAI\u2019s actual participation in that attack, it is not disputed that TAI acted according to the Gang\u2019s plan and initiated the attack by knocking the deceased off his bicycle down the slope into the open field. The Prosecution\u2019s case, based on HAL\u2019s evidence, is that thereafter, TAI gave chase and held the deceased in an armlock while MAG inflicted the fatal injuries (see [25] above). TAI denies this.",
      "59": "On balance, we are not satisfied that TAI held on to the deceased for a significant period of time long enough for MAG to inflict the fatal injuries. There are several reasons why we have come to this conclusion. First, HAL\u2019s evidence that TAI held on to the deceased for a significant period of time is not without difficulty since it has already been demonstrated that HAL had trouble recollecting the events which took place on the night of the four attacks. While we are satisfied that HAL\u2019s evidence that MAG alone wielded the parang is reliable, the same cannot be said about his evidence on the duration for which TAI held on to the deceased while MAG struck the deceased with the parang. Second, we note that while there was street lighting on the footpath beside the open field where the attack took place, there were no lights in the open field (see [18] above), which was also where the fatal injuries were inflicted on the deceased. HAL\u2019s vision would thus have been impaired by the lack of lighting. When this is considered together with the fact that the events during the attack on the deceased would have unfolded very rapidly, we are not satisfied that it is safe to rely on HAL\u2019s testimony that TAI held the deceased for a sufficiently long period of time for MAG to inflict the fatal wounds. Third, we find persuasive the submission made by counsel for TAI, Mr Amarick Gill (\u201cMr Gill\u201d), that it is unlikely that TAI could have held on to the deceased for a significant period of time while MAG wielded the parang indiscriminately without TAI himself suffering blows. It must be remembered that it was dark in the open field, and in all likelihood, TAI would not have held on to the deceased for the entire duration of the attack given the real possibility that he could himself have been struck by the parang. The Prosecution argues that it is reasonable to infer that TAI, in restraining the deceased, \u201cpositioned himself in such a way as to avoid the risk of injuries arising from MAG\u2019s slashing\u201d by pushing the deceased away from himself. We find this submission impermissibly speculative. There is no direct evidence that TAI in fact did so, and given that the burden of establishing this fact lies with the Prosecution, it would be improper to speculate and fill in gaps in the evidence. In the circumstances, we are not satisfied that TAI held on to the deceased for a significant period of time, allowing MAG to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased. Given the risk to himself, it was just as likely that when MAG began to strike the deceased, TAI could have released his hold over the deceased.",
      "60": "We should add that Mr Gill has highlighted the fact that neither the deceased\u2019s blood nor his DNA was detected on the clothes which TAI wore during the attack. According to HAL\u2019s evidence, which was the key basis of the Prosecution\u2019s case at the trial, TAI grabbed hold of the deceased after MAG slashed his back and held the deceased in an armlock (see [25] above). If TAI had indeed done so, his clothes would have come into contact with the deceased\u2019s blood. The absence of the deceased\u2019s blood and/or DNA on TAI\u2019s clothes would strongly suggest, according to Mr Gill, that TAI did not in fact hold on to the deceased as HAL claimed.",
      "61": "No expert evidence was adduced at the trial as to whether blood stains and DNA on clothes can be completely removed by washing. The Prosecution seemed to have acknowledged that it is not possible to completely remove DNA from clothes contaminated by blood. This appears to be reinforced by the fact that the clothes which TAI wore during the attack were shown to have Ang\u2019s DNA even though there was evidence from the Prosecution that those clothes had been washed. This strongly suggests that washing clothes stained with DNA will not fully remove the DNA traces. On this basis, Mr Gill\u2019s argument concerning the absence of the deceased\u2019s blood and/or DNA on TAI\u2019s clothes appears to have merit, indicating that it is highly unlikely that TAI held on to the deceased in the manner described by HAL. This in turn means that the fundamental plank on which the Prosecution rests its argument in CCA 11 that TAI should, like MAG, be sentenced to death is, in all likelihood, invalid. In any event, even if we take the view that it is not possible for us to make any firm conclusion on this matter given the available evidence and the absence of expert evidence on all the permutations of what most likely occurred during the attack on the deceased, the conclusion to be drawn would be neutral \u2013 neither detrimental nor favourable to TAI. The same can be said of the Prosecution\u2019s reliance on the forensic evidence that the deceased\u2019s DNA was found on TAI\u2019s belt (see [23] above). This fact alone cannot tell us whether or not TAI did in fact hold on to the deceased for a sufficiently long period of time for MAG to inflict the fatal wounds on the deceased.",
      "62": "Considering both TAI\u2019s mental state and his actual involvement in the attack on the deceased, we are not satisfied that he acted in blatant disregard for human life such that the ultimate sentence of death is warranted. There are a myriad of ways in which a guilty confederate may be involved in an offence of murder. On the facts of the present case, we accept that TAI initiated the attack on the deceased. We are, however, not satisfied that he held on to the deceased for a significant period of time long enough for MAG to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased. We appreciate that TAI must have known that MAG would in all likelihood use the parang on the deceased in the same manner as he did in relation to the first three victims. Even so, we have doubts as to whether such knowledge on TAI\u2019s part, coupled with his act of initiating the attack on the deceased, is, without more, sufficient to amount to a blatant disregard for human life.",
      "63": "Had there been a preconceived plan to inflict the heinous injuries which were sustained by the deceased (as opposed to knowledge that a savage and merciless attack on the deceased was likely), or a plan to kill the deceased in such a brutal manner, the imposition of the death penalty on TAI may well have been justified. Similarly, had there been more certainty on the evidence as to TAI\u2019s actual participation in the attack (eg, by holding on to the deceased so as to allow MAG to slash him or by egging MAG on (see Leong Soon Kheong ([53] supra) at [37])) apart from his initiation of the attack, the death penalty may also have been warranted. We stress again that each case must turn on its own facts. On the facts of this case, we do not see sufficient basis to disturb the Judge\u2019s exercise of his discretion to sentence TAI to life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane instead of imposing the ultimate sentence of death.",
      "64": "In conclusion, we dismiss MAG\u2019s appeal in CCA 9 against conviction and sentence, and we also dismiss the Prosecution\u2019s appeal in CCA 11 against TAI\u2019s sentence. We express our appreciation to Mr Tiwary, Mr Gill and the Prosecution for their diligence in the carriage of this matter.",
      "65": "At the end of the day, the punishment must fit the crime. We are satisfied that the death penalty is warranted for MAG given his savage use of the parang on the deceased. The same, however, cannot be said of TAI\u2019s involvement in the attack on the deceased. In the context of the test expounded in Kho Jabing (Re-sentencing) ([47] supra), we are not satisfied that TAI\u2019s culpability is sufficient to warrant the imposition of the death penalty, although we should add that our decision in this regard rests on a very fine balance."

      "1": "This is an appeal against the conviction of the appellant, Iskandar bin Rahmat (\u201cthe Appellant\u201d), on two counts of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), punishable with death under s 302(1) of the Penal Code. The Appellant challenges the convictions on the basis that his actions do not show an intention to cause death, but instead (assuming that one or more of the exceptions to murder under s 300 does not apply) reflect only an intention to cause injuries sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death under s 300(c) of the Penal Code, an offence which does not attract the mandatory death sentence. As just alluded to, he also relies upon three different exceptions to murder under s 300 of the Penal Code (including ss 300(a) and 300(c)), namely, (a) Exception 2 (exceeding the right of private defence); (b) Exception 4 (sudden fight); and (c) Exception 7 (diminished responsibility). In the event that one or more of these exceptions applies, the Appellant argues for the imposition of a sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment under s 304(a) of the Penal Code. Finally, in the event that the court is of the view that the Appellant ought to be convicted under s 300(c) of the Penal Code instead, the Appellant argues for the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment instead of the death sentence under s 302(2) of the Penal Code.",
      "2": "During the period leading up to the present appeal, the Appellant also filed two separate criminal motions, viz, Criminal Motion No 14 of 2016 (\u201cCM 14/2016\u201d) and Criminal Motion No 17 of 2016 (\u201cCM 17/2016\u201d). CM 14/2016 was filed on 19 July 2016 and is an application for leave to adduce a forensic pathology report by Dr Ong Beng Beng (\u201cDr Ong\u201d) dated 13 July 2016 (\u201cDr Ong\u2019s Pathology Report\u201d). CM 17/2016 was filed on 5 August 2016 and is an application for leave to adduce a forensic psychiatric report by Dr John Bosco Lee (\u201cDr Lee\u201d) dated 3 August 2016 (\u201cDr Lee\u2019s Psychiatric Report\u201d).",
      "3": "The background facts leading to the Appellant\u2019s arrest have been covered comprehensively in the decision of the judge below (\u201cthe Judge\u201d), which may be found at PP v Iskandar bin Rahmat [2015] SGHC 310 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d). Most of the facts are not disputed by the parties and we do not propose to repeat them here. What was of contention between the parties were the events that took place in the house of the first victim, Mr Tan Boon Sin (\u201cD1\u201d), over a period of about 30 minutes, and it suffices for the present appeal to focus on what had happened (or at least, what the Appellant alleges to have happened) during that period of time, save for the following key facts.",
      "4": "The Appellant was an investigation officer with the Singapore Police Force (\u201cSPF\u201d). Between 2012 and 2013, the Appellant started experiencing serious financial difficulties and was at risk of losing his job. The Appellant thus devised a plan to rob D1. D1 had stored a substantial sum of money in his safe deposit box at Certis CISCO (\u201cCISCO\u201d) which the Appellant knew about because he had previously come across a police report filed by D1 regarding some moneys missing from the safe deposit box. The Appellant\u2019s plan was to call D1 and introduce himself as a police officer. He would inform D1 that he had received information that the latter\u2019s safe deposit box at CISCO would be \u201chit\u201d, and that the latter should therefore remove its contents so that he could place a CCTV camera inside the safe deposit box. For this purpose, the Appellant had prepared a dummy CCTV camera which he placed in a box.",
      "5": "On 10 July 2013, the Appellant met D1 at a petrol station near CISCO and executed his plan. D1 agreed to put the CCTV camera in his safe deposit box as requested and left for CISCO. However, as the CCTV camera and the box could not fit into the safe deposit box, D1 initially did not carry out the Appellant\u2019s instructions. When D1 returned to the petrol station, the Appellant told D1 that he could place the camera without its box in the safe deposit box. D1 again did as he was told and returned to CISCO. This time, he placed the camera into the safe deposit box successfully. D1 also removed the moneys in his safe deposit box (we were informed that the sum was in excess of $600,000) and stored them in an orange bag that he had brought along for this purpose. D1 then returned to the petrol station to meet the Appellant. The Appellant, on the pretext of escorting D1 as D1 was carrying a lot of money, then followed D1 in D1\u2019s car to D1\u2019s house.",
      "6": "As alluded to earlier, what happened in D1\u2019s house is a matter of contention between the parties. We note at the outset that the Appellant does not dispute stabbing D1 and his son, Mr Tan Chee Heong (\u201cD2\u201d), in D1\u2019s house and that the injuries were fatal. What the Appellant contends is that his version of events of what transpired in D1\u2019s house shows that he had no intention to cause the death of either victim. It is to the Appellant\u2019s account of events that we now turn, which as the Judge noted at [19] of the Judgment, is the only account available.",
      "7": "According to the Appellant, he and D1 had arrived at the latter\u2019s house within a relatively short space of time. After the car was parked, D1 closed the gate. The Appellant and D1 then entered the house. D1 left the orange bag which contained the contents of his safe deposit box (and which contained an enormous sum of money in excess of $600,000) near the staircase that led up to the second floor of the house and went into the kitchen to get a drink for the Appellant. The Appellant alleged that he had wanted to grab the orange bag and run at that point, but did not do so as the outer gate was closed and he did not know how to open it. He then told D1 that he wanted to go outside to smoke, thereby getting D1 to open the gate. The Appellant accordingly went outside the house to smoke.",
      "8": "When he returned, he told D1 not to close the gate as his \u201cpartner\u201d was about to arrive. D1 complied. The Appellant then asked to use the toilet, and D1 showed him to it (the toilet was inside the utility room adjoining the kitchen). The Appellant alleges that while in the toilet, he prepared himself \u201cto walk out, grab the bag and run away\u201d. However, when he came out of the toilet, he realised the bag was no longer by the staircase. He panicked and looked around cursorily for the bag but could not find it.",
      "9": "D1 was then in the living room using his mobile phone, allegedly speaking in Hokkien. The Appellant returned to the living room and pretended to receive some communication on his fake \u201cwalkie talkie\u201d. He told D1 that someone had opened his safe deposit box, and that D1 should grab the orange bag and the two of them would return to CISCO. D1 appeared to be shocked. He then headed into the kitchen and used the corded phone there. At this juncture, the Appellant was in the living room near the organ.",
      "10": "D1 then emerged from the kitchen and started walking towards the Appellant at a normal pace with his arms by his side. D1 said to the Appellant in Malay that the Appellant had cheated him as the CCTV camera did not contain any batteries. The Appellant was surprised at being discovered and told D1 that the CCTV did not require batteries. D1 did not respond and continued walking towards the Appellant. D1 came down the flight of steps connecting the dining room to the living room and then brandished a knife in his right hand. D1 raised his right arm and brought the knife down on the Appellant. The Appellant grabbed D1\u2019s hand but D1 pulled it away. This caused the knife to cut the Appellant\u2019s right hand. D1 came at the Appellant again in the same manner, but this time, the Appellant managed to wrest the knife from D1\u2019s hand. The Appellant alleges that he could not remember how he did this as it all happened very quickly.",
      "11": "D1 then started pulling at the Appellant. In response, the Appellant swung the knife at D1\u2019s neck in a right to left motion. The Appellant alleges that D1 remained strong and continued to tug at the Appellant and even tried to punch him. The Appellant therefore continued to stab D1. D1 started to shout \u201cAh ... Ah ...\u201d, and the Appellant used his left hand to cover D1\u2019s mouth to stop him from shouting. D1 bit his hand in return. As the Appellant tried to pull his left hand away, he stabbed D1 a few more times at the neck area. The Appellant stabbed D1 until \u201chis body became soft\u201d and when D1\u2019s grip eventually weakened, the Appellant slowly lowered D1 to the floor.",
      "12": "The Appellant remembered stabbing D1 five to six times, though he acknowledged that the autopsy reports showed a lot more wounds. When asked why he stabbed D1 so many times, the Appellant\u2019s response was \u201cI do not know\u201d. The Appellant testified that he was panicking at that point in time. He said that he was not aiming to kill D1 or for any vital areas, and that he just wanted to get D1 off him so he could run away. The Appellant claimed he was \u201cfearing for [his] life\u201d and that, due to the struggle, he could only swing the knife towards the neck of D1.",
      "13": "As the Appellant laid D1 on the floor, he heard someone, ie, D2, shout \u201cPa!\u201d from the front door. The Appellant was still near the organ and D2 was two to three steps away from the Appellant. D2 charged at the Appellant with his hands clenched and swung his right fist at the Appellant. The Appellant blocked the blow with his left hand and intended to retaliate by punching D2 with his right hand. He alleged that he did not realise the knife was still in his right hand and he ended up stabbing D2 in the neck or face area. The Appellant testified that his immediate concern was to \u201crun for [his] life\u201d, but D2 stood between him and the front door. D2 continued to punch and pull at the Appellant, and the Appellant swung his arms wildly in a state of panic, thereby stabbing D2 further. He testified that he was not aiming to stab at any particular part of D2\u2019s anatomy, though in his statement to the police dated 21 July 2013 he said that he \u201cstabbed [D2] also at his neck a few times\u201d. He claimed that he had just wanted to get away from D2. D2 eventually fell backwards, and even at this juncture, was still attempting to kick the Appellant. D2 then managed to stand up and another scuffle ensued. After a while, the Appellant released his grip on D2, who then turned around and ran out of the house.",
      "14": "The Appellant subsequently decided that he needed to leave the house quickly and abandoned any intention to find the orange bag. He said he went back to the toilet in the utility room to take a towel to wrap his injured hand (he recalled seeing one there when he used the toilet previously). On his way out of the house, the Appellant saw D1\u2019s car key on the floor and picked it up. He also picked up a parking coupon on which he had earlier written the words \u201cRahman\u201d and \u201cPID\u201d at the request of D1, as well as his sunglasses and wristlet. In his statement dated 21 July 2013, he said he was afraid of being identified. He then walked out of the house towards the front passenger seat of D1\u2019s car to straighten the left side view mirror that was allegedly folded in when D1 first drove past the gate. He then walked round the front of the car to the driver\u2019s side, where he noticed some blood on the side of the car and on the floor of the porch. He thought D2 could have left the house already and denied seeing D2\u2019s body.",
      "15": "The Appellant started the car and reversed out of the house. He recalled the left side view mirror hitting against the gate again. Unbeknownst to the Appellant, D2\u2019s body was in the driveway, and the Appellant had reversed over D2\u2019s body. D2\u2019s body thus got caught in the undercarriage of the car and was dragged along by the car for some distance.",
      "16": "The rest of the Appellant\u2019s version of what happened after he left D1\u2019s house is largely not in dispute, and as alluded to above at [3], have been set out in detail in the Judgment below. They are not necessary for the disposal of this appeal and we shall not repeat them here.",
      "17": "Before setting out the Judge\u2019s reasons for convicting the Appellant on two counts of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code, we summarise the injuries suffered by the victims as set out in the autopsy reports performed by Dr Gilbert Lau (\u201cDr Lau\u201d).",
      "18": "D1 suffered a total of 23 stab and incised knife wounds (excluding four defensive knife wounds he had on both hands) to vulnerable areas such as the head, neck and chest. Five wounds were to the neck of D1 and included a stab to the back of the neck that went 6cm deep and cut the cervical spinal cord. They also included a \u201cdeep, gaping incised wound\u201d (measuring 8x5cm) to the front of D1\u2019s neck, which Dr Lau described as a \u201ccut-throat injury across the front of the neck\u201d that cut through a major artery. This was identified to be the substantive cause of death. Seven wounds were to the chest of D1 and included two stabs wounds that were, respectively, 11cm and 13cm deep. The 13cm deep wound was the deepest of all 12 stab wounds and was considered a contributory cause of death. Nine wounds were incised wounds to D1\u2019s face and scalp.",
      "19": "D2 suffered a total of 17 stab and incised wounds (excluding three defensive knife wounds on his hands) to the neck, face and scalp. Four wounds were stabs to the neck and included one to the back of D2\u2019s neck which stopped short of the cervical spinal cord, and another that was 7\u20138cm deep. The latter wound was considered the substantive cause of death. Three wounds were stabs to the side of D2\u2019s face, one of which was 8\u20139cm deep. Ten wounds were incised wounds to D2\u2019s face and scalp. Considerable force was used to inflict one of the incised wounds to D2\u2019s scalp \u2013 this caused an open fracture such that fragments of the fractured bone were found adhering to the underlying part of the brain which had also been very superficially incised. D2 also suffered extensive grazing on his face, trunk and limbs, consistent with wounds caused by friction between D2\u2019s body and the road. Dr Lau said, however, that the stab wound to D2\u2019s neck was so severe that D2 would have been dead or at the brink of death before his body was dragged by the car.",
      "20": "The Judge disbelieved the Appellant\u2019s evidence that his alleged plan was only to rob D1 and not kill him. He was of the view that it was obvious that escaping without being identified was crucial to the Appellant\u2019s plans. However, the Appellant\u2019s professed grab-and-run plan involved so many contingencies that only a very foolish prospective thief would adopt it. Furthermore, it would have been foolhardy in the circumstances for the Appellant to have hoped or assumed that D1 would be unable to identify the Appellant subsequently. The Judge found that the Appellant would not have come up with such an inane plan, especially when contrasted with the meticulous planning on his part for the charade with D1 earlier that day (at [73]\u2013[75] of the Judgment ([3] supra)). Even if the Appellant\u2019s plan was indeed a simple grab-and-run, there were ample opportunities for him to snatch the bag of money and run while he was at D1\u2019s house, and yet he did not do so. The Judge disbelieved the Appellant\u2019s explanation for these squandered opportunities, ie, that he felt bad about wanting to steal D1\u2019s money and did not want to cause any hurt to D1 by having to push him away (at [76]\u2013[78] of the Judgment).",
      "21": "The Judge also disbelieved the Appellant\u2019s story that D1 had discovered his ruse and turned violent. There was no logical explanation as to how D1 had found out about the fake CCTV camera. It could not be the case that D1 had found out when he spoke to D2 over the telephone. The evidence demonstrated that D2 had left his office for D1\u2019s house that afternoon looking normal. Neither D1 nor D2 made a call to the police regarding the Appellant\u2019s trickery either. In all probability, D1 had asked D2 to come home to help with any statement the former had to give to the Appellant\u2019s \u201cpartner\u201d (at [79]\u2013[80] of the Judgment).",
      "22": "The Judge did not accept that D1 would want to hurt the Appellant with a dangerous weapon in his own house simply because he had found out that he had been tricked. D1 appeared to be a trusting and hospitable person. Furthermore, D1 was physically outmatched by the Appellant. D1\u2019s money was still with him and the police was only a telephone call away (at [81]\u2013[83] of the Judgment).",
      "23": "The Judge was of the view that it was inconceivable that the Appellant, allegedly fearing for his life because D1 came at him with a knife, would think of muzzling his attacker. His anxiety to silence D1 demonstrated in truth that it was he who was attacking the hapless D1. This is corroborated by the sheer number of wounds to very vulnerable parts of D1\u2019s body, contrasted with the relatively minor injuries on the Appellant (at [84] of the Judgment). While it was not an efficient killing, the overwhelming number and severity of the injuries inflicted on D1 and D2 demonstrated the ferocity and viciousness with which the Appellant attacked them (at [85] of the Judgment). There was no doubt that the Appellant had intended to kill D1 as part of his plan, and for that purpose he brought along the knife (at [87] of the Judgment).",
      "24": "In so far as D2 was concerned, even if he had charged at the Appellant upon witnessing his father covered in blood being lowered onto the floor, he was doing no more than trying to protect his father or apprehend the Appellant. The Appellant was still holding the knife at that particular point in time. If there was any right of private defence to be exercised, it would belong to D2 and not the Appellant. There was also no sudden quarrel since all that D2 managed to utter was \u201cPa!\u201d before he too became a victim of the Appellant (at [86] of the Judgment). D2 never featured in the Appellant\u2019s plan, but when he appeared, the Appellant could not allow D2 to live to recount what he had seen. The Appellant formed the intention to kill D2 there and then, or just before D2\u2019s arrival at D1\u2019s house (at [87] of the Judgment).",
      "25": "The Judge also dealt briefly with aspects of the Prosecution\u2019s case that differed from the Appellant\u2019s. The Judge did not accept the Prosecution\u2019s case that the Appellant suffered the cuts on his right hand when he attacked D2 (instead of D1) and that the Appellant was walking around looking for the orange bag of money before D2 arrived (at [90] of the Judgment). The Judge also rejected the Prosecution\u2019s case that the Appellant had hidden behind the door while waiting for D2 to arrive, and had ambushed him upon his arrival (at [91] of the Judgment). The Judge accepted that the Appellant ran out after D2 when the latter stumbled out of the house, but upon seeing D2 collapse just outside the house, he stopped giving chase (at [93] of the Judgment). The Appellant\u2019s purpose in going to the passenger side of D1\u2019s car was to chase D2 and not to adjust the side mirror as he alleged (at [94] of the Judgment). While the Appellant knew he would run over D2\u2019s body, that was not his purpose. There was simply no other way to drive away from D1\u2019s house other than over D2\u2019s body (at [96] of the Judgment). Finally, in so far as the knife was concerned, the Judge found that it belonged to the Appellant (at [97] of the Judgment).",
      "26": "The Judge therefore found that neither the exceptions of exceeding the right of private defence nor sudden fight applied to the Appellant vis-\u00e0-vis both D1 and D2. The Appellant had caused the death of D1 and D2 with the clear intention of causing death. The Judge accordingly convicted the Appellant of both counts of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code.",
      "27": "As may be observed from the Appellant\u2019s version of events, the Appellant does not deny stabbing D1 and D2, thereby killing them. The crux of the Appellant\u2019s defence is that he did not intend to cause the deaths of D1 and D2. He alleges that his plan from the outset was to rob, not to kill. He had inflicted those injuries upon D1 and D2 only because both men had attempted to assault him.",
      "28": "D1 had at some point discovered the Appellant\u2019s ruse and that the CCTV camera the Appellant had asked D1 to place in the safe deposit box was a fake. D1 turned violent as a result and came at the Appellant with a knife. A struggle ensued and the Appellant managed to wrest the knife from D1. As D1 continued to pull at the Appellant, the Appellant swung the knife at D1 multiple times until D1\u2019s \u201cbody became soft\u201d. The Appellant alleges he was in fear of his safety and his paramount consideration was to get D1 off him so that he could run away.",
      "29": "In so far as D2 was concerned, D2 had charged at the Appellant upon witnessing the scene between the Appellant and D1. The Appellant instinctively retaliated by punching D2 without realising that the knife was still in his hand, and he ended up stabbing D2. D2 continued to punch and pull at the Appellant, and in response the latter swung his arms wildly at D2, thereby stabbing D2 further. The Appellant alleges that his immediate concern was to \u201crun for [his] life\u201d, but D2 stood between him and the front door. He claims that as the pair struggled, all he wanted to do was to get D2 away from him.",
      "30": "As already noted above (at [1]), the Appellant challenges the convictions on the basis that his actions do not show an intention to cause death, but instead (assuming that one or more of the exceptions to murder under s 300 does not apply) reflect only an intention to cause injuries sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death under s 300(c) of the Penal Code, an offence which does not attract the mandatory death sentence. As just alluded to, he also relies upon three different exceptions to murder under s 300 of the Penal Code (including ss 300(a) and 300(c)), namely, (a) Exception 2 (exceeding the right of private defence); (b) Exception 4 (sudden fight); and (c) Exception 7 (diminished responsibility). In the event that one or more of these exceptions applies, the Appellant argues for the imposition of a sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment under s 304(a) of the Penal Code. Finally, in the event that the court is of the view that the Appellant ought to be convicted under s 300(c) of the Penal Code instead, the Appellant argues for the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment instead of the death sentence under s 302(2) of the Penal Code.",
      "31": "The Prosecution submits that the Appellant had planned all along to kill D1 in order to get away with the money and ensure that he would not be identified. To this end, the Appellant had brought the knife along with him. The Appellant\u2019s story that D1 had discovered the Appellant\u2019s trickery and had attacked him with a knife is simply untrue as there was nothing that would have led to D1 uncovering the truth. Further, the knife wounds inflicted by the Appellant on D1 clearly speak of his intention to kill D1.",
      "32": "In so far as D2 was concerned, the Prosecution submits that the Appellant had no choice but to kill D2 in order to silence him. The intention to kill D2 was formed there and then, or just before D2\u2019s arrival at D1\u2019s house, and this is evidenced by the injuries inflicted by the Appellant upon D2.",
      "33": "The Prosecution further argues that Exceptions 2 and 4 to s 300 of the Penal Code do not apply as the circumstances did not give rise to the right of private defence of the body on the part of the Appellant and there was no sudden fight and/or quarrel. The Appellant was also not suffering from any mental illness at the time of the offences as opined by the Prosecution\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr Jerome Goh Hern Yee (\u201cDr Goh\u201d), in his reports dated 5 September 2013 (\u201cDr Goh\u2019s 2013 Report\u201d) and 21 September 2016 (\u201cDr Goh\u2019s 2016 Report\u201d). Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code is thus not available to the Appellant.",
      "34": "We stress at the outset that it is not strictly necessary for the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant had planned to kill either or both victims from the beginning. It is well-established that the intention to cause death under s 300(a) of the Penal Code need not be pre-planned or premeditated, and can be formed on the spur of the moment, just before the actual killing takes place. If, of course, it can be shown that the Appellant had planned to kill both victims all along, then the intention to cause the deaths of the victims at the time of the killing would be established in an a fortiori fashion (see, for example, the Malaysian Court of Appeal decision of Ismail bin Hussin v Public Prosecutor [1953] MLJ 48, adopted by this court in Shaiful Edham bin Adam v PP [1999] 1 SLR(R) 442 at [64]). But the converse is not true. Even if the Appellant had no premeditated plan to kill D1 and D2, he would still be equally guilty of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code if it can be shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant had the intention to cause the deaths of D1 and D2 at the time of the killing. This is the central question before the court. To answer this question, the court must determine, as a matter of fact, what had transpired in D1\u2019s house. As is common with many cases of murder, the only person who can shed light as to what occurred during the moments leading to the death of the victims is the Appellant himself. We therefore now turn to examine the Appellant\u2019s story in greater detail.",
      "35": "The Appellant admits that he had intended to and did cause the injuries suffered by D1 which led to the latter\u2019s death. His case is that he did not intend to kill D1 and was merely trying to defend himself against D1\u2019s assault on him with the knife. According to the Appellant, after he told D1 that they had to return to CISCO, D1 walked to the kitchen and used the telephone there. When D1 came out of the kitchen, D1 told the Appellant that the CCTV camera did not contain any batteries and accused the Appellant of cheating him. D1 then assaulted the Appellant with a knife. It is apparent that the Appellant\u2019s case is predicated upon the court believing his version of events, ie, that D1 discovered the Appellant\u2019s deception and came at him with a knife. The fundamental problem with the Appellant\u2019s case, however, is that it does not provide a reasonable explanation as to how D1 could have discovered the Appellant\u2019s ruse or that the CCTV camera was a fake, and why D1 would turn violent as a result and attack the Appellant with a knife.",
      "36": "We reiterate what had happened when D1 met with the Appellant at the petrol station near CISCO. The Appellant had passed the dummy CCTV camera (which was placed in a box) to D1 and instructed him to remove his belongings from the safe deposit box and place the camera in it. D1 dutifully complied with the Appellant\u2019s instructions. CCTV cameras in CISCO captured D1 removing the contents from his safe deposit box and attempting to place the box containing the dummy camera in the safe deposit box. However, as the box and camera could not fit into the safe deposit box, D1 returned to the Appellant with the camera. The Appellant then instructed D1 to try placing the camera without its box in the safe deposit box. Again, D1 dutifully carried out the Appellant\u2019s instructions. This time, D1 was successful and he returned to the Appellant carrying cash in excess of $600,000, which he kept inside the orange bag. The Appellant then offered to escort D1 home as the latter was carrying a lot of money and D1 agreed. The two then proceeded to D1\u2019s house together in D1\u2019s car.",
      "37": "In our judgment, the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from what transpired at the petrol station near CISCO is that D1 had trusted the Appellant and believed that he was participating in a \u201csting\u201d operation conducted by the Appellant and the police. There is nothing to indicate that D1 was or became suspicious of the Appellant. If D1 knew that the CCTV camera was a fake, or that the Appellant was trying to cheat him, it made no sense for D1 to have complied with the Appellant\u2019s instructions and attempt to place the dummy CCTV camera in the safe deposit box. The fact that he went back to CISCO a second time after he failed to place the box containing the dummy CCTV camera in his safe deposit box the first time confirms that he had found nothing amiss. Furthermore, when D1 returned after the second visit to CISCO, he was carrying a substantial sum of money. Yet, he permitted the Appellant to \u201cescort\u201d him home and even invited the Appellant into his home and served the Appellant a drink. All these facts lead to the inexorable conclusion that up to the time when D1 arrived at his house with the Appellant, D1 was comfortable with the Appellant and did not harbour any reservations as to the entire operation. Even if D1 did realise that the CCTV camera did not contain batteries, he must have either not thought much of it or he was satisfied with whatever explanation the Appellant had given him. Indeed, counsel for the Appellant, Mr Wendell Wong (\u201cMr Wong\u201d), was unable to suggest any other reasonable inference that might be drawn from the foregoing facts.",
      "38": "For D1 to have assaulted the Appellant subsequently as the Appellant alleges, something must have happened in the interim to displace D1\u2019s state of comfort with the Appellant such that it became discomfort and, finally, certainty that the Appellant had cheated him. In this regard, Mr Wong relied on three facts to demonstrate that D1 had become suspicious of and/or had known that the Appellant was tricking him. The first is a call from D1 to his friend, Roland Soh Chee Meng (\u201cRoland\u201d), at approximately 3.12pm on 10 July 2013. The second is that the Appellant hid the orange bag containing the money. The third is the two calls from D1 to his son, D2, at approximately 3.21pm and 3.28pm on 10 July 2013 respectively. We will deal with each of these facts in turn.",
      "39": "In so far as the call to Roland is concerned, Roland\u2019s evidence was that D1 spoke very quickly and appeared to be in a rush to hang up. According to Roland, he felt something was amiss as D1 had never spoken to him in such a rushed manner before. In our judgment, the call to Roland and Roland\u2019s evidence does not assist the Appellant. All that this tells us at best is that D1 appeared to be speaking very quickly and was in a rush to hang up. This is entirely to be expected considering D1 believed he was involved in a \u201csting\u201d operation. Furthermore, D1 and Roland were good friends. If D1 was anxious or felt threatened, one would have expected him to tell Roland that. Instead, D1 informed Roland that he would be back at the workshop soon and hung up. We also note that a few minutes thereafter, at 3.15pm, D1 called another friend, Oh Chye Huat (\u201cChye Huat\u201d), to inform Chye Huat that he was engaged at the moment and would be late returning to the workshop. Likewise, there was no mention of any concern by D1. In fact, the content of D1\u2019s conversations with Roland and Chye Huat explains why D1 would sound like he was in a hurry \u2013 there were two persons waiting for him at his workshop and he was in a hurry to get there. In our view, after the call to Chye Huat, the Appellant was still in a state of comfort vis-\u00e0-vis the Appellant. There was nothing Roland or Chye Huat said that would have caused D1\u2019s state of mind to change and put him on alert.",
      "40": "The fact that D1 hid the orange bag containing the contents of the safe deposit box also does not assist the Appellant. Mr Wong submitted that since D1 was under the impression that he was in the company of a law enforcement agent, he was therefore in his comfort zone, and there would be no necessity to rush to hide the bag unless something had intervened to raise D1\u2019s suspicions. We do not agree. The orange bag contained a very substantial amount of cash. The most basic level of precaution any reasonable person would take is to not leave the bag out in plain sight, even if one were in his own home. Furthermore, it was not as though D1 had locked the bag away. He simply stashed it in the storeroom out of plain sight. In the context of somebody who locks his cash in a safe deposit box in CISCO, it is not that unusual for D1 to have placed the bag in a less conspicuous place, even if he were comfortable with and trusted the Appellant.",
      "41": "This leaves us with the third fact relied upon by Mr Wong, ie, the calls to D2. It was suggested that D1 could have discovered the camera was a fake and/or the Appellant\u2019s scheme through his conversations with D2 over the phone, and this was why D2 allegedly left his office and drove to D1\u2019s house that fateful afternoon. However, Vivien Ong Chew Fei (\u201cMs Ong\u201d), one of D2\u2019s employees, recalled that when D2 left the office that day shortly after answering a call at around 3.00pm, D2 \u201cappeared to be normal and even smiled at [her] before he left\u201d and had told Ms Ong to \u201ctake care of the office for a while\u201d. D2 also left the lights in his office switched on which, according to Ms Ong, he would not normally do unless he intended to return in a short while. Furthermore, according to the footage of the CCTV camera belonging to 14H Hillside Drive, D1\u2019s neighbour\u2019s house, D2 was captured walking normally into D1\u2019s house. This would not be the behaviour one would expect of a son who just discovered that there was an impostor in the house who was attempting to cheat his father. In our judgment, Ms Ong\u2019s evidence and the CCTV footage from the neighbour\u2019s house are inconsistent with any suggestion that D1 and D2 had through their telephone conversations discovered the Appellant\u2019s deception.",
      "42": "We add that there appears to be a very good and innocuous reason why D2 went home that afternoon in a calm fashion. As the Judge had found at [86] of the Judgment ([3] supra), D2 was likely going home to help D1 with any statement D1 might potentially have to give to the Appellant or his \u201cpartner\u201d. After all, the Appellant had informed D1 that he would have to record D1\u2019s statement after his \u201cpartner\u201d arrived. D1\u2019s wife, Mdm Ong Ah Tang (\u201cMdm Ong\u201d), gave evidence that because D1 was not conversant in English, he would typically ask D2 or his daughter for help in translation whenever he received calls or letters. D2\u2019s office was also very close to D1\u2019s house.",
      "43": "There is therefore no evidence of anything that had occurred from the time D1 and the Appellant entered D1\u2019s house (at which point D1 remained trusting of the Appellant (see above at [37])) that could have caused D1 to become suspicious of the Appellant and eventually convinced that the Appellant was trying to deceive him. In our judgment, even if D1 had somehow uncovered the Appellant\u2019s scheme, it is simply unbelievable that he would have become so enraged that he would attack the Appellant with a knife. According to Mdm Ong, D1 was not a violent person. Furthermore, D1 must have known it would not have been an even fight. He was a 67-year-old man with a chronic knee problem while the Appellant was a relatively younger 34-year-old, who up to that point D1 believed was a police officer performing his duties. It would have been a simple matter for D1 to have either waited for his son to return or called the police. We therefore reject the Appellant\u2019s story that D1 had at some point discovered his ruse and assaulted him with a knife as a result.",
      "44": "We make one further observation. We note that there are some discrepancies in the Appellant\u2019s statements to the police and to Dr Goh in 2013 in respect of when D1 allegedly attacked him. This must be contrasted with how consistently the Appellant had recounted the rest of his version of events. According to the Appellant, after he came back from smoking outside the house, he had asked to use the toilet. D1 then showed him the toilet.\n(a)     In his first statement to the police dated 13 July 2013, the Appellant said that when he came out of the toilet and started walking to the orange bag, D1 attacked him straight away with a knife and accused the Appellant of cheating him.\n(b)     In his second statement to the police dated 21 July 2013, the Appellant said that when he came out of the toilet, he noticed the orange bag was missing. He panicked and noticed D1 using his mobile phone in the living room. He then decided to concoct a story about how the safe deposit box had been opened again and that they should therefore hurry back to CISCO. He also told D1 to bring the orange bag. D1 then went into the kitchen and used the telephone. When D1 emerged from the kitchen, he \u201ccame at [the Appellant] with a knife\u201d and accused the Appellant of cheating him.\n(c)     In Dr Goh\u2019s 2013 Report, it was recorded that the Appellant had said that when he came out of the toilet, he noticed the orange bag was missing and was shocked. He saw D1 using his mobile phone in the living room. He then told D1 that someone had opened his safe deposit box and that the latter should take the orange bag and put everything back into the box. D1 took a different plastic bag and returned to his car, saying that he wanted to go back to his workshop. Then, D1 went into the kitchen to use a corded phone. D1 then emerged from the kitchen and came at him. D1 accused the Appellant of cheating him, and walked towards the Appellant. Only when D1 was very near the Appellant and raised his hand did the Appellant notice D1 holding a knife.",
      "45": "We emphasise that these inconsistencies are certainly not conclusive in and of themselves. However, they reinforce to some extent our rejection of the Appellant\u2019s argument that D1 had attacked the Appellant with a knife. It is also pertinent that these inconsistencies relate to the period immediately preceding D1\u2019s alleged attack on him, as opposed to the periods during or after the attack. While the Appellant\u2019s memory of the latter might be hazy given how quickly events unfolded, it is less likely to be so for the former.",
      "46": "It is clear, in our view, that if the Appellant is unable to persuade this court that D1 had discovered his ploy, turned violent and assaulted him with a knife, the Appellant\u2019s defence vis-\u00e0-vis D1 would have no legs left to stand on. There is no alternative case put forward by the Appellant. As mentioned above, the Appellant is the only person who can shed light on what happened in D1\u2019s house in the moments leading up to the killing. If the Appellant\u2019s evidence is disbelieved, the only evidence that is left before the court is his admission that he intended to and did cause the injuries suffered by D1. In our view, the overwhelming number and severity of the wounds inflicted by the Appellant to vulnerable parts of D1\u2019s body demonstrate, in and of itself, an intention to cause death. The Appellant admitted that he knew he was stabbing D1 at the neck. He could not remember how many times he stabbed D1 but only stopped when D1\u2019s body had become soft. On the Appellant\u2019s own evidence, D1 was unarmed for the most part and the Appellant suffered few injuries. Even if there was a struggle and the Appellant had instinctively stabbed D1, he could have stopped after the first (or even second) stab. Yet, he proceeded to stab and cut D1 22 more times at vulnerable parts of D1\u2019s body. Given our finding that D1 did not attack him, there was no reason for the Appellant to have been so vicious in his assault on D1 other than to kill D1. His explanation that he only wanted D1 to loosen his grip on him and that he had stabbed D1\u2019s neck because that was the only area he could stab is simply unbelievable. The fact that the Appellant had used his left hand to muzzle D1\u2019s mouth when D1 started crying out after being stabbed is also incongruous with any intention to merely disable D1\u2019s grip on him. In the circumstances, we find that the Appellant intended to cause the death of D1 at the time of the killing.",
      "47": "For completeness, we address one contention heavily relied upon by the Appellant, viz, that the Prosecution has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant had brought the knife with him. The Appellant argues that it was possible that the knife came from D1\u2019s house as there were old knives stored in a drawer in the kitchen and in the shed where D1 kept his fishing gear that D1\u2019s wife, Mdm Ong, did not keep a count of. She thus could not confirm that there were no knives missing from those locations (although she confirmed that there were no knives missing from the kitchen counter beside the sink). In our view, where the knife originated from is immaterial to the appeal. It is undisputed that the Appellant had used that knife to inflict the injuries on D1 (and D2), and if the Appellant had the intention to cause death at the material time, then that is the end of the matter. Simply raising the possibility that the knife could have originated from the house does not have any impact on our finding that the Appellant has failed to prove D1 turned aggressive and attacked the Appellant.",
      "48": "In fact, we note that it is equally possible that the Appellant had brought the knife along with him. Mdm Ong, who was familiar with the number of knives on the kitchen counter, confirmed that there were no knives missing from the kitchen counter. If the knife originated from D1\u2019s house, the Appellant (or D1 for that matter) would have grabbed it from the knives displayed on the kitchen counter where it was most readily accessible. There was no reason why the Appellant (or D1) would have opened the kitchen drawer and/or the shed and rummage through it in order to obtain the knife. Furthermore, it was not impossible for the Appellant to have concealed the knife while he was with D1. According to the Appellant\u2019s own description, the knife was not a big one and could have fit into a pocket. In any event, as mentioned above at [46], whether the knife came from the house or was brought along by the Appellant is immaterial. What remains incontrovertible is that the Appellant had used the knife to cause the death of D1, and the Appellant has not been able to prove that he had done so because D1 flew into a rage and assaulted him with that knife.",
      "49": "In the circumstances, we find that an offence of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code in respect of D1 is made out. We now turn to consider whether the Appellant is nevertheless entitled to raise Exceptions 2 and 4 to s 300 of Penal Code. If he is able to do so, he would be punished under s 304 of the Penal Code, under which the maximum punishment is life imprisonment and caning, instead of s 302(1) of the Penal Code, which carries the mandatory death penalty.",
      "50": "Exception 2 to s 300 of the Penal Code provides as follows:",
      "51": "To satisfy Exception 2, the Appellant must prove on a balance of probabilities the following elements (see this court\u2019s decision in Soosay v PP [1993] 2 SLR(R) 670 at [29]):\n(a)     the right of private defence has arisen;\n(b)     the right was exercised in good faith;\n(c)     the death was caused without premeditation; and\n(d)     the death was caused without any intention of doing more harm than was necessary for the purpose of such defence.",
      "52": "In respect of the first element, this court in Tan Chor Jin v PP [2008] 4 SLR(R) 306 (\u201cTan Chor Jin\u201d) held that two preconditions must be satisfied before the right of private defence arises in respect of the accused\u2019s own body (at [39]):\n(a)     the person purporting to exercise the right of private defence (\u201cthe defender\u201d) must have been the subject of an offence affecting the human body; and\n(b)     the defender must have attempted to seek help from the relevant public authorities if there was a reasonable opportunity for him to do so.",
      "53": "Given our finding that the Appellant has failed to prove that D1 attacked him with a knife, the Appellant has likewise failed to show that he had been the subject of an offence affecting his body. The Appellant has not put forward any alternative case other than that D1 attacked him. In the circumstances, we are of the view that the right of private defence had not arisen vis-\u00e0-vis D1.",
      "54": "In any event, even if we were to accept that D1 did attempt to attack the Appellant with a knife, we are of the view that the Appellant did not attempt to seek help from the relevant public authorities despite there being a reasonable opportunity for him to do so. As noted above at [43], D1 had a chronic knee problem which impeded his movement significantly. According to Mdm Ong, when D1 climbed steps or made big movements, he had to hold onto something for support and balance. Between February 2011 and July 2013, D1 consulted two orthopaedic surgeons, both of whom diagnosed him with severe or end-stage osteoarthritis of the left knee. One of them, Dr Kevin Lee, described D1 as walking with a \u201csignificant limp\u201d and opined that the speed at which D1 would be able to charge at somebody was \u201cvery, very limited\u201d. When asked if D1 would have been able to run or charge down the flight of steps connecting the kitchen to the living room unassisted, Dr Kevin Lee\u2019s reply was \u201cnot without falling down first\u201d.",
      "55": "According to the Appellant, he first saw D1 armed with a knife when D1 was \u201cat the steps area\u201d. At that particular point in time, the Appellant was standing near the organ in the living room. Considering D1\u2019s knee condition, which the Appellant must have noticed previously, this put plenty of space between D1 and the Appellant for the latter to have turned around and run out of the house to seek help. Instead, the Appellant chose to stay and wrestle with D1, and when he managed to gain control of the knife, he brutally stabbed D1 in vulnerable areas multiple times. In our view, the injuries the Appellant inflicted on D1 also demonstrate that the Appellant had an intention to do more harm than was necessary for the purpose of any alleged defence.",
      "56": "In the circumstances, the Appellant is not entitled to rely on Exception 2 to s 300 of the Penal Code.",
      "57": "Exception 4 to s 300 of the Penal Code provides as follows:",
      "58": "In Tan Chun Seng v PP [2003] 2 SLR(R) 506 (\u201cTan Chun Seng\u201d), this court identified three main ingredients which prompt the operation of this partial defence (at [16]):\n(a)     sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel;\n(b)     absence of premeditation; and\n(c)     no undue advantage or cruel or unusual acts.",
      "59": "Whether or not there was in fact a sudden fight in any given case depends on the unique factual matrix of the case (see Tan Chun Seng at [21]). We have already found that the Appellant has not shown that D1 had attacked him with a knife. As this is the only case put forward by the Appellant, he has failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that there was a sudden fight between him and D1. He is thus not entitled to rely on Exception 4 to s 300 of the Penal Code either.",
      "60": "As was the case with D1, the Appellant admits that he had intended to and did cause the injuries suffered by D2 which led to the latter\u2019s death. If it can be shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant had an intention to kill at the time he caused those injuries, he would be guilty of an offence under s 300(a) of the Penal Code. We set out again what the Appellant alleges had happened vis-\u00e0-vis D2.",
      "61": "The Appellant\u2019s case is that when he was lowering D1\u2019s body down on the floor after D1\u2019s \u201cbody became soft\u201d, D2 appeared at the doorway of the house. D2 shouted \u201cPa!\u201d and charged at the Appellant with clenched fists. D2 swung his right fist at the Appellant, which the Appellant blocked. The Appellant intended to retaliate by punching D2 with his right hand, but failed to realise that the knife was still in his hand, and he ended up stabbing D2 in the neck or face area. D2 continued to punch and pull at the Appellant, and the latter swung his arms wildly, thereby stabbing D2 further. The Appellant alleges that he was not aiming the knife at any particular part of D2\u2019s anatomy, and that all he wanted to do was to get D2 away from him so that he could escape from D1\u2019s house.",
      "62": "We find the Appellant\u2019s claim that he did not realise the knife was still in his hand to be an incredible one. He must have known that he was still gripping the knife, and we find that his intention was to injure D2 with it. Even if his claim is to be believed, the Appellant should have realised the knife was in his hands after the first stab. Yet, as the Appellant admits, he proceeded to stab D2 in the neck a few more times. In fact, the Appellant cut and stabbed D2 a total of 16 more times. While the Appellant claims that he was not aiming for any particular part of D2\u2019s body, all of the 17 knife wounds inflicted on D2 were to the face, neck and scalp. The congregation of injuries to these vulnerable parts of D2\u2019s body shows that the Appellant\u2019s attacks on D2 were targeted. Coupled with the sheer number of times he had stabbed and cut D2, in our judgment, the Appellant must have intended to cause D2\u2019s death. As the Judge pointed out, D2 was much lighter than the Appellant and could not have been so menacing and strong that the Appellant, while armed with a knife, had to retaliate with such ferocity and brutality (at [88] of the Judgment ([3] supra)).",
      "63": "There was some dispute as to whether the Appellant knew that D2 had collapsed on the driveway after running out of D1\u2019s house and whether the Appellant had intentionally run over D2. In our view, this is not critical to the appeal. Dr Lau\u2019s evidence was that the stab wound to D2\u2019s neck was so severe that D2 would have been dead or on the brink of death before his body was dragged by the car. Given our finding that the Appellant had intended to kill D2 as he caused those injuries to the latter, we are of the view that an offence of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code vis-\u00e0-vis D2 is made out. We now turn to the Exceptions.",
      "64": "It may be the case that D2 had charged at the Appellant with clenched fists. But it must be remembered that D2 had just witnessed the Appellant lowering his father\u2019s limp and bloodied body on the floor. Furthermore, the Appellant, who was much heavier than D2, was still holding on to the knife at the time. It would have been only natural for D2 to try to apprehend the Appellant and defend his father, D1. We agree with the Judge\u2019s finding that in such a situation, if there was any right of private defence to be exercised, that right would belong to D2 and not the Appellant (see the Judgment at [86]). The Appellant was clearly the aggressor in this case. As the Court of Appeal in Tan Chor Jin ([51] supra) noted (at [46(c)]):",
      "65": "In any event, the manner in which the Appellant viciously attacked D2 with the knife demonstrates that he had intended to do more harm than was necessary for the purpose of any alleged self-defence. In our judgment, the Appellant is not entitled to rely on Exception 2 to s 300 of the Penal Code in respect of D2.",
      "66": "In determining whether the partial defence of sudden fight is available to the Appellant vis-\u00e0-vis D2, the guidelines identified by this court in Tan Chun Seng ([57] supra) at [21] are apposite. The court would typically look at:\n(a)     whether the fight and injuries suffered by the deceased were premeditated by the accused;\n(b)     whether the accused was armed with the relevant weapon before the fight began; and\n(c)     whether, during the fight, the accused had reason to resort to a weapon \u2013 ie, here the courts have placed substantial emphasis on the disparity of size between the deceased and the accused.",
      "67": "In the present case, the Appellant was armed with the knife before any alleged sudden fight began. The Appellant was also heavier than D2. Even if D2 had charged at the Appellant, there was no reason for the Appellant to have resorted to stabbing and cutting D2 in vulnerable areas with the knife so many times. The Appellant had clearly taken undue advantage of and acted in a cruel manner towards D2. In the premises, the Appellant is likewise not entitled to rely on Exception 4 to s 300 of the Penal Code in respect of D2.",
      "68": "We now turn to the last line of the Appellant\u2019s defence, viz, Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code. If the Appellant is unable to prove on a balance of probabilities the partial defence of diminished responsibility under Exception 7, he would be guilty of two offences under s 300(a) of the Penal Code for the murder of D1 and D2.",
      "69": "We note at the outset that the Appellant never relied on the partial defence of diminished responsibility at the trial below. This is unsurprising given that only the prosecution\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr Goh, had examined the Appellant in 2013, and Dr Goh had opined that the Appellant was not suffering from any mental illness at the time of the offences. The Appellant was content to not call his own psychiatrist. Indeed, counsel for the Appellant at the trial below stated that he was willing to accept Dr Goh\u2019s 2013 Report and that it was not negative to the Appellant\u2019s case. The Appellant\u2019s counsel further indicated that he wanted to rely (and did rely) on Dr Goh\u2019s evidence. In such circumstances, we find it highly unsatisfactory for the Appellant to seek to adduce a fresh psychiatric report produced three years after the offences were committed and to rely on a new exception for the first time in this appeal. Not only is the court deprived of the benefit of cross-examination of the Appellant\u2019s psychiatrist, the fact that the Appellant alleges he had a mental condition at the material time so late in the day would call into question the genuineness of his defence. Accused persons do themselves a disservice by adopting such a drip-feed approach to their defence. Accused persons should and are expected to put their best case forward at the earliest time possible. Indeed (and particularly after the observations that have just been made), this court might exercise its discretion to reject such drip-feed applications in the future.",
      "70": "Turning to the criminal motions filed in the present appeal, we deal first with CM 17/2016, the Appellant\u2019s application for leave to adduce Dr Lee\u2019s Psychiatric Report.",
      "71": "Dr Lee assessed the Appellant on three occasions, viz, 15 and 24 June 2016 and 27 July 2016, and produced a report, ie, Dr Lee\u2019s Psychiatric Report. Based on the information provided to him, Dr Lee opined that the Appellant suffered from adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressive reaction between mid-2012 to mid-2013. In his view, the Appellant also developed acute stress reaction during the offences where there were violent struggles, which is an acute reaction to a crisis characterised by \u201cautonomic, dissociative, mental and bodily symptoms\u201d. These \u201cabnormal mental states\u201d of the Appellant were present at the time of the offences and contributed significantly to the multiple stabbing of D1 and D2. Dr Lee was also of the view that the abnormal mental states were important causal factors of the offences and substantially impaired the Appellant\u2019s behavioural and psychological state during the offences.",
      "72": "In response to Dr Lee\u2019s Psychiatric Report, Dr Goh, who had previously assessed the Appellant in 2013 and produced a report dated 5 September 2013, ie, Dr Goh\u2019s 2013 Report, filed an affidavit exhibiting a response report, ie, Dr Goh\u2019s 2016 Report. In Dr Goh\u2019s 2016 Report, he disagreed with Dr Lee\u2019s opinion that the Appellant suffered from adjustment disorder and acute stress reaction. He opined that the Appellant did not suffer from any mental illness at the time of the commission of the offences. This was the same opinion Dr Goh had expressed in his 2013 Report.",
      "73": "On 12 October 2016, Dr Lee produced a report in response to Dr Goh\u2019s 2016 Report (\u201cDr Lee\u2019s Response Report\u201d) (exhibited in the Appellant\u2019s Affidavit dated the same). In Dr Lee\u2019s Response Report, Dr Lee maintained his diagnosis of the Appellant. He alleged that Dr Goh\u2019s conclusions were based on incomplete information, and that Dr Goh had failed to give due consideration to important new information the Appellant provided to Dr Lee in 2016.",
      "74": "The principles governing the admission of fresh evidence in a criminal appeal are set out in the Singapore High Court decision of Soh Meiyun v PP [2014] 3 SLR 299 (\u201cSoh Meiyun\u201d). Chao Hick Tin JA in Soh Meiyun favoured the less restrictive approach adopted by this court in Mohammad Zam bin Abdul Rashid v PP [2007] 2 SLR(R) 410, ie, that the three conditions in the leading English Court of Appeal decision of Ladd v Marshall [1954] 1 WLR 1489 of \u201cnon-availability\u201d, \u201crelevance\u201d and \u201creliability\u201d applied, but that the first condition of \u201cnon-availability\u201d was less paramount than the other two conditions. The consequence is that (see Soh Meiyun at [16]):",
      "75": "The principal objection the Prosecution takes in respect of the admission of Dr Lee\u2019s Psychiatric Report is that the report is based primarily on the Appellant\u2019s self-reported information to Dr Lim in 2016, which substantially differed from what the Appellant had told Dr Goh in 2013, and is thus not reliable. It must be remembered that at the leave stage, the court is only concerned with the reliability of the report and is not assessing the merits of the report. When assessing the reliability of new evidence sought to be adduced on appeal, the court is only concerned with whether the evidence is such as is presumably to be believed, ie, apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible (see Soh Meiyun at [14]).",
      "76": "In our view, Dr Lee\u2019s Psychiatric Report is apparently credible. First, it must be noted that Dr Lee\u2019s Psychiatric Report appears to contain Dr Lee\u2019s independent, truthful and professional opinions, which are based on information the Appellant provided him and other relevant documents such as the Appellant\u2019s statement to the police dated 21 July 2013, Dr Goh\u2019s 2013 Report, the Appellant\u2019s previous medical reports as well as the Appellant\u2019s staff appraisal report. Dr Lee is a qualified psychiatrist registered with the Singapore Medical Council and an accredited specialist in psychiatry with the Ministry of Health. He previously held positions such as Senior Consultant Psychiatrist in Prison and various clinical appointments at the Institute of Mental Health. He has been an expert witness for the High Court before and is proficient in the \u201cassessment of forensic psychiatric cases, violence risks ... and use of structured assessment instruments\u201d.",
      "77": "Second, it is not true that Dr Lee\u2019s Psychiatric Report is based primarily on the Appellant\u2019s self-reported information. Dr Lee had considered, inter alia, Dr Goh\u2019s 2013 Report, his statement to the police, and the Appellant\u2019s staff appraisal reports for the years 2009\u20132012, and had made references to them in arriving at his conclusions. In so far as Dr Lee\u2019s Psychiatric Report is based on information that the Appellant provided to Dr Lee in 2016, which is different from what the Appellant told Dr Goh in 2013, this does not, in and of itself, render Dr Lee\u2019s Psychiatric Report unreliable. Indeed, the Appellant has sought to provide an explanation for the differences. The Appellant alleges that he felt uncomfortable sharing his feelings and problems with Dr Goh. When he answered Dr Goh\u2019s questions about his feelings and behaviour, he \u201ctold Dr Goh what he felt a Police Officer should be like when faced with stressors\u201d and was \u201cnot describing himself as being unaffected\u201d. After reading Dr Goh\u2019s 2013 Report, the Appellant claimed he felt that Dr Goh had \u201ctotally misunderstood him\u201d. It may be the case that the Appellant\u2019s explanation and the new information he provided to Dr Lee are mere afterthoughts, but, in our view, this is a matter that goes to the weight that should be placed on Dr Lee\u2019s evidence and opinions. What remains undisputed is that the opinions contained in Dr Lee\u2019s Psychiatric Report are based on Dr Lee\u2019s bona fide and professional assessment of the Appellant.",
      "78": "In our judgment, Dr Lee\u2019s Psychiatric Report satisfies the requirement of \u201creliability\u201d for the purposes of granting leave to adduce fresh evidence on appeal. We therefore allow CM 17/2016. We stress, however, that this does not mean that Dr Lee\u2019s evidence is to be preferred over Dr Goh\u2019s evidence. This is a question that goes to the respective merits of, and the weight that should be given to, each report, and it is to this question that we now turn.",
      "79": "Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code provides as follows:",
      "80": "As noted by this court in Ong Pang Siew v PP [2011] 1 SLR 606 (\u201cOng Pang Siew\u201d) at [57], Exception 7 was derived from s 2 of the English Homicide Act 1957 (Cap 11) (\u201cthe 1957 English Act\u201d) (both provisions are in pari materia). During the second reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill (Bill 138 of 1961) Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (24 May 1961) vol 14 (\u201cSecond Reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill\u201d), Mr K M Byrne, the Minister for Labour and Law, stated that the effect of this defence is that (at cols 1509\u20131510):",
      "81": "There are three distinct requirements under Exception 7 which must be satisfied before an accused is entitled to rely on it (see the decisions of this court in Ong Pang Siew at [58] and PP v Wang Zhijian [2014] SGCA 58 (\u201cWang Zhijian\u201d) at [50]):\n(a)     The accused was suffering from an abnormality of mind (\u201cthe first limb\u201d).\n(b)     Such abnormality of mind (\u201cthe second limb\u201d):\n(i)       arose from a condition of arrested or retarded development;\n(ii)       arose from any inherent causes; or\n(iii)       was induced by disease or injury.\n(c)     The abnormality of mind substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the death (\u201cthe third limb\u201d).",
      "82": "It is further well established that whilst the second limb (otherwise known as the aetiology or root cause of the abnormality) is a matter largely to be determined based on expert evidence, the first and third limbs are matters which cannot be the subject of any medical opinion and must be left to the determination of the trial judge as the finder of fact (see for example, the decision of this court in Chua Hwa Soon Jimmy v PP [1998] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [21]; the Singapore High Court decision of PP v Juminem [2005] 4 SLR(R) 536 at [5]; as well as the decisions of this court in Zailani bin Ahmad v PP [2005] 1 SLR(R) 356 at [51] and Ong Pang Siew at [59]).",
      "83": "In respect of the first limb, what amounts to an \u201cabnormality of mind\u201d was defined by Lord Parker CJ, delivering the judgment of the court in the seminal English Court of Criminal Appeal decision of R v Byrne [1960] 2 QB 396 (\u201cByrne\u201d) (at 403):",
      "84": "The above definition in Byrne has been adopted by this court (see Ong Pang Siew at [61] and, more recently, Wang Zhijian at [64]). As was clarified in the Privy Council decision (on appeal from the Supreme Court of the Bahama Islands) of Elvan Rose v The Queen [1961] AC 496 (\u201cRose v R\u201d), the defence is not limited to conditions on the \u201cborderline of insanity\u201d (affirmed in Ong Pang Siew at [62]). Thus, the court when examining whether there was an \u201cabnormality of mind\u201d must determine whether the evidence exists of the three possible manifestations contained in the Byrne definition (see above at [81]), viz, an abnormally reduced mental capacity to (a) understand events; (b) judge the rightness or wrongness of one\u2019s actions; or (c) exercise self-control (see Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan, and Chan Wing Cheong, Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2015) (\u201cYMC\u201d) at para 27.12). While the evidence of clinical experts will be relevant, this question is ultimately one of fact to be decided by the trial judge (see Ong Pang Siew at [59]).",
      "85": "If an \u201cabnormality of mind\u201d (ie, one of the three possible manifestations in the Byrne definition (see above at [81])) is proven on the evidence, the next question for the court is whether the \u201cabnormality of mind\u201d arose from or was induced by one of the prescribed causes in the second limb, ie, identifying the aetiology of the abnormality. We note that, as described by the learned authors of YMC, the causal descriptors in the second limb \u201chave been the source of uncertainty and complexity in practice\u201d (at para 27.21). This is because the prescribed causes are notoriously difficult to define and apply. Not only are they capable of being interpreted in multiple ways, they appear to have no agreed upon meaning or definition among psychiatrists and/or other professionals. As observed by R D Mackay in Mental Condition Defences in the Criminal Law (Oxford University Press, 1995) (at pp 187\u2013188):",
      "86": "Some insight may be gleaned from the historical origins and the Parliamentary debates in respect of the second limb when s 2 of the 1957 English Act was introduced. According to Edward Griew, \u201cThe Future of Diminished Responsibility\u201d [1998] Crim L R 75 (at 77\u201378), the second limb of Exception 7 had a \u201cstrange origin\u201d:",
      "87": "At the second reading of the English Homicide Bill which introduced s 2(1) of the 1957 English Act, the Home Secretary, Major Gwilym Lloyd\u2013George, noted that the new defence of diminished responsibility would be open to those \u201cwho, although not insane [under the test in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case (1843) 10 Cl & Fin 200; 8 ER 718], are regarded in the light of modern knowledge as insane in the medical sense and those who, not insane in either sense, are seriously abnormal, whether through mental deficiency, inherent causes, disease or injury\u201d (see House of Commons, Parliamentary Debates (15 November 1956) vol 560). He emphasised that the defence was only \u201cintended to cover those grave forms of abnormality of mind which [might] substantially impair responsibility\u201d and was \u201cnot intended ... to provide a defence to persons who are merely hot-tempered, or who, otherwise normal, commit murder in a sudden excess of rage or jealousy\u201d.",
      "88": "During the debates just referred to, there was some concern over the effect of the second limb, specifically, whether it was meant to limit the causes of abnormality of mind that would entitle an accused person to the defence, or whether it was merely meant to be illustrative. In response, the Attorney-General explained that the second limb was intended to (see House of Commons, Parliamentary Debates (27 November 1956) vol 561):\n(a)     limit the defence to conditions \u201cbordering on insanity\u201d (this, however, has subsequently been clarified in Rose v R not to be the case);\n(b)     give an indication to judge and jury of the kind of abnormality that is meant to enable a defence to run under this provision; and\n(c)     exclude the mere outburst of rage or jealousy from the ambit of the defence.",
      "89": "This was subsequently confirmed by the Lord Chancellor when the Homicide Bill was debated in the House of Lords in March 1957 (see House of Lords, Parliamentary Debates (7 March 1957) vol 202).",
      "90": "It is apparent that the second limb, at least when s 2 of the 1957 English Act was introduced, was meant to be a limitation on when the defence of diminished responsibility would apply. The main aim was to \u201cexclude the mere outburst of rage or jealousy from the ambit of the defence\u201d. In the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal decision of R v Whitworth [1989] 1 Qd R 437, Derrington J described the purpose behind the second limb as follows:",
      "91": "Unfortunately, not much was said in relation to the second limb when Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code was introduced in Singapore. All that was mentioned by the then Minister for Labour and Law during the Second Reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill was the following (at cols 1510\u20131511):",
      "92": "The Appellant has suggested that the prescribed causes under the second limb should be read broadly to include \u201cany recognised medical condition contained in the international classificatory systems of mental conditions\u201d, eg, the World Health Organisation\u2019s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (\u201cthe ICD\u201d) or the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\u201cthe DSM\u201d). In the light of the foregoing discussion (above at [83]\u2013[88]), this may be an attractive approach at first blush. However, in our judgment, the express wording of Exception 7 and the second limb is clear \u2013 the onus is still on the accused person to identify which of the prescribed causes is applicable in his case. Expert witnesses are thus well-advised to, on top of diagnosing whether the accused person was suffering from a recognised mental condition, identify which prescribed cause, if any, in their opinion gave rise to the accused\u2019s abnormality of mind. We note, however, that the wording of the prescribed causes do appear wide enough to include most recognised medical conditions.",
      "93": "In this regard, we observe that the second limb has been removed from the diminished responsibility defence in both England as well as in New South Wales. In 2009, s 2(1) of the 1957 English Act was amended to provide, instead, as follows:",
      "94": "In support of these changes, the Royal College of Psychiatrists commented that these changes were in line with the \u201cgeneral nature and purpose\u201d of the defence of diminished responsibility (reproduced in The Law Commission, Murder, Manslaughter and Infanticide (Law Com No 304, 2006) (Chairman: The Honourable Mr Justice Etherton) at para 5.114):",
      "95": "In New South Wales, the second limb was removed altogether by amendments enacted in 1997. Section 23A of the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900 currently provides as follows:",
      "96": "The New South Wales Law Reform Commission stated the following observations regarding the second limb (New South Wales, Law Reform Commission, Partial Defences to Murder: Diminished Responsibility (Report 82, 1997) (Chairman: Michael Adams QC) at paras 3.39\u20133.40):",
      "97": "Of course, whether Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code should be similarly amended is a matter reserved solely for the Singapore Parliament to decide.",
      "98": "We return to the present case. In our judgment, regardless of which interpretation is given to the second limb, the Appellant has not proven on a balance of probabilities that he is entitled to invoke Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code. This is because we prefer Dr Goh\u2019s evidence over Dr Lee\u2019s, and find that the Appellant was not suffering from any mental illness at the material time. Let us elaborate.",
      "99": "Dr Lee diagnosed the Appellant to be suffering from two main conditions at the time of the offences: (1) adjustment disorder, and (2) acute stress reaction. The parties do not dispute what these two conditions entail. Adjustment disorder is (in Dr Lee\u2019s words in Dr Lee\u2019s Response Report):",
      "100": "Acute stress reaction is (again in Dr Lee\u2019s words in Dr Lee\u2019s Response Report):",
      "101": "Dr Lee\u2019s diagnosis of adjustment disorder is based on the Appellant\u2019s reporting of distress manifesting as anxiety, confusion, disturbed sleep, fear, depressed moods and cognitive disturbances. His diagnosis of acute stress reaction is based on the fact that the Appellant felt \u201cdazed\u201d during the offences, did not see the towels clearly present along the walkway, and had inaccurate recollection of and inadequate explanation for the many stab wounds he had inflicted on the victims. In Dr Lee\u2019s opinion, these mental states of the Appellant \u201ccontributed significantly\u201d to the stabbing of D1 and D2, and \u201csubstantially impaired his behavioural and psychological state during the offences\u201d.",
      "102": "In contrast, Dr Goh\u2019s 2013 Report diagnosed the Appellant to be of sound mind at the time of the alleged offences, in that he was aware of the nature of his actions and that they were wrong. He came to this view for the following reasons:\n(a)     the Appellant constantly denied the presence of any depressive or psychotic symptoms around the material time;\n(b)     based on the Appellant\u2019s self-report, there was no discernible impairment in various domains of his functioning such as at work and his relationships with family and friends; and\n(c)     this was consistent with the Appellant\u2019s behaviour when Dr Goh examined him \u2013 he did not show any sign or symptom of mental illness.",
      "103": "In Dr Goh\u2019s 2016 Report, he disagreed with Dr Lee\u2019s diagnosis and maintained his own. From the report, it can be seen that his disagreement stemmed from the following reasons:\n(a)     Adjustment disorder:\n(i)       the psychiatric symptoms that Dr Lee relied on, ie, anxiety, confusion, disturbed sleep, fear, depressed moods and cognitive disturbances, were not reported to him when he assessed the Appellant in 2013; and\n(ii)       Dr Lee took into account irrelevant factors, eg, the incongruences in sophistication between the Appellant\u2019s acknowledged abilities and the actual conduct of the offences, as well as the frequency of the Appellant\u2019s visits to a General Practitioner in July and August 2012.\n(b)     Acute stress reaction:\n(i)       the Appellant was able to furnish accounts of the offences to him in considerable detail in 2013, eg, describing the layout of the house, when D1 lunged at him with a knife, the Appellant\u2019s reactions etc;\n(ii)       the Appellant had no difficulty relating these accounts and was not distressed;\n(iii)       the Appellant\u2019s actions following the offences did not suggest he had acute stress reaction, eg, wrapping his bleeding hand with a towel and removing items which might identify him; and\n(iv)       there were other possible reasons why the Appellant does not have an \u201caccurate recollection\u201d of the offences now (almost three years after the offence), ie, the events had \u201chappened very fast\u201d.",
      "104": "We prefer Dr Goh\u2019s diagnosis over Dr Lee\u2019s. We first highlight that Dr Goh\u2019s 2013 Report has the advantage of being more contemporaneous, and is consistent with the Appellant\u2019s self-assessment in his statement to the police dated 23 July 2013 where he stated that he did \u201cnot have any health or mental related issues\u201d and had \u201cnever felt a need to consult a psychiatrist or believe[d] [he was] suffering from a mental issue\u201d.",
      "105": "In respect of Dr Lee\u2019s diagnosis of adjustment disorder, it is clear that it is based primarily on the \u201cnew\u201d psychiatric symptoms that the Appellant reported he had at the material time, ie, anxiety, confusion, disturbed sleep, fear, depressed moods and cognitive disturbances. In our judgment, however, these \u201cnew\u201d psychiatric symptoms and the Appellant\u2019s explanation for why he kept them from Dr Goh are mere afterthoughts.",
      "106": "In his Affidavit dated 12 October 2016, the Appellant stated that he was reserved by nature and was uncomfortable opening up to Dr Goh. He was afraid that portraying his true emotions would damage the image of the SPF, something which he felt was \u201cmore important than what [he] felt\u201d. He was also concerned about any stigma that may be cast on his family if he were to be diagnosed with a mental illness. The Appellant was of the view that based on his answers to Dr Goh, the latter should have appreciated that the former was putting on a front. We do not accept the Appellant\u2019s explanation.",
      "107": "First, it is clear from Dr Goh\u2019s 2013 Report that the Appellant did not have an issue opening up to Dr Goh. As Dr Goh observed in his 2016 Report (at paras 10\u201312):",
      "108": "Second, the Appellant did not raise his alleged psychiatric symptoms or his discomfort with Dr Goh to anyone for the past three years. The Appellant\u2019s counsel at trial would have advised him of the various defences related to mental illness. Even if the Appellant\u2019s counsel had not, the Appellant admitted that he was aware of a mental health defence. Dr Goh\u2019s 2016 Report stated (at para 17):",
      "109": "If the Appellant felt that Dr Goh had misunderstood him, or that he had provided an inaccurate account of his mental state to Dr Goh because of an alleged discomfort with the latter, he should have raised it to his counsel at trial, and a separate psychiatrist would undoubtedly have been appointed to examine him. Yet, the Appellant was content to proceed on the basis of Dr Goh\u2019s 2013 Report. Further, the Appellant was facing two charges of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code when he was examined by Dr Goh. In such circumstances, we find the Appellant\u2019s alleged fear of damage to the reputation of the SPF and stigma to his family if he were diagnosed with a mental illness to be incredible and mere afterthoughts.",
      "110": "Accordingly, we place little or no weight on Dr Lee\u2019s diagnosis that the Appellant had adjustment disorder.",
      "111": "We turn to Dr Lee\u2019s diagnosis that the Appellant had acute stress reaction at the time of the offences. He based his diagnosis on the following account provided by the Appellant:\n(a)     when D1 attacked him with a knife, he panicked and his mind went blank;\n(b)     he was shocked to learn that he had stabbed D1 more than the two to three times which he thought he did;\n(c)     he was shocked to learn that he stabbed D2 twenty to thirty times;\n(d)     he did not see the injuries or the blood of D1;\n(e)     he was unable to explain why he had stabbed D1 and D2 so many times; and\n(f)     he proceeded straight to the toilet for a towel to wrap his wounded hand without noticing the other towels along the walkway to the toilet.",
      "112": "However, the Appellant\u2019s allegation that his mind went \u201cblank\u201d must be contrasted with the level of detail and specificity with which he was able to describe the alleged struggle with D1 and D2, not only to Dr Goh in 2013 (as noted in Dr Goh\u2019s 2016 Report at para 63), but also in his statements to the police \u2013 all of which were broadly contemporaneous accounts given by the Appellant himself. He could also remember specifically which areas of the victims he had stabbed. His allegation that he thought he stabbed D1 only two to three times is also inconsistent with his statement to the police dated 21 July 2013:",
      "113": "While it is true that the Appellant could not remember the exact number of times he stabbed D1, this is unsurprising given the number of times he had stabbed D1 as well as how quickly the events unfolded. The same could be said about D2. The Appellant not noticing the towels along the way to the toilet is equivocal. It could well be the case that the Appellant had seen the towel in the toilet previously, and when he thought of grabbing a towel, he immediately homed in on it. We are therefore of the view that there is little factual foundation supporting Dr Lee\u2019s diagnosis of acute stress reaction and we place little or no weight on it.",
      "114": "In the circumstances, we prefer Dr Goh\u2019s evidence and find that the Appellant was not suffering from any mental illness at the time of the offences. We are therefore satisfied that the Appellant is not entitled to invoke Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code.",
      "115": "It remains for us to deal with CM 14/2016. As mentioned above at [2], this is an application for leave to adduce Dr Ong\u2019s Pathology Report dated 13 July 2016. The Prosecution objects to the admission of Dr Ong\u2019s Pathology Report on the basis that it is not material to the issues on appeal. The report contained the following conclusions:\n(a)     that it is more likely that the wounds on the Appellant were defence-type injuries rather than injuries inflicted upon himself during attempts to stab or incise the deceased victims;\n(b)     that it cannot be ascertained from the injuries alone that the knife used had a smooth or serrated blade despite the absence of unique marks associated with serrated blades; and\n(c)     that the blade of the knife could be shorter than the depth of the wound.",
      "116": "It is apparent from our findings above that Dr Ong\u2019s conclusions on the characteristics of the knife are immaterial to the appeal. Nothing turns on the length of the knife or whether it had a smooth or a serrated edge. Dr Ong\u2019s conclusions on the wounds to the Appellant\u2019s right hand may appear to support the Appellant\u2019s case that D1 had attacked him with a knife and the Appellant had used his right hand to block a blow from D1. However, given our finding (based on all the relevant evidence) that D1 did not attack the Appellant with the knife, these conclusions become immaterial. We also note that although Dr Ong opined that the injuries sustained by the Appellant are more consistent with \u201cdefence type [injuries] i.e. trying to block the blow and possibly trying to hold onto the blade\u201d, he also acknowledged that it was possible for the injuries to have been self-inflicted (though he qualified it by saying that it was only \u201cremotely possible\u201d). We therefore dismiss CM 14/2016.",
      "117": "We are therefore satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Appellant had intended to and did cause the deaths of D1 and D2 and is guilty of both counts of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code. In the circumstances, we dismiss the appeal."

Both men were arrested at about 3pm on 12 June 2014.

He too came to Singapore in May 2014 although he cannot remember the exact date. They are friends and are also distantly related. Rasheed stayed in Room 44 at 6 Rowell Road together with one Muhammad Noor, 59 years old at that time. Ramzan stayed in the same house but in either Room 24 or 42 on the ground level.",
      "4": "Both Rasheed and Ramzan face a charge of committing murder with common intention under s 302(1) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed), by causing the death of Muhammad Noor on 11 June 2014 at Room 44, 6 Rowell Road, Singapore. The prosecution\u2019s case is that they killed Muhammad Noor with the intention of causing his death (s 300(a) of the Penal Code).",
      "5": "Associate Professor Gilbert Lau (\u201cA/P Lau\u201d), a forensic pathologist, examined Muhammad Noor\u2019s corpse and concluded that the death was \u201cconsistent with smothering\u201d. He found various other injuries on the body. These included abrasions across the neck and a fracture at the base of the thyroid cartilage, but he believed that these injuries might have been caused after Muhammad Noor had already died, or when he was \u201cpractically dead\u201d. The reason lies in the conspicuous absence of haemorrhage in those areas.",
      "6": "Rasheed and Ramzan do not dispute that they were in Muhammad Noor\u2019s room at the time of the attack, although Ramzan claimed in his oral testimony that he ran out of Room 44 whilst Muhammad Noor was still alive. They blamed each other for Muhammad Noor\u2019s death. Rasheed claimed that although he gambled with Muhammad Noor, he did make a small profit of $200 to $300 overall. He said it was Ramzan who lost money, and that it was Ramzan who wanted to kill Muhammad Noor. Rasheed claimed that he helped Ramzan in the murder because Ramzan was a drug addict and dangerous. He (Ramzan) had threatened harm to Rasheed\u2019s family if he refused to help. Rasheed claimed that he was thus terrified into helping Ramzan kill Muhammad Noor.",
      "7": "Ramzan, on the other hand, testified that he lost $1,100 to Muhammad Noor gambling with him on 9 June 2014. He and two of his aunts as well as another man (also named Rasheed, but not the first accused) went to implore Muhammad Noor to return the money to Ramzan. Muhammad Noor did not return the money, and on 11 June 2014, Ramzan joined Rasheed to gamble with Muhammad Noor again. Midway through this session, which was in Room 44, Ramzan pleaded with Muhammad Noor to return his money. Muhammad Noor refused and Rasheed suddenly reached across Muhammad Noor\u2019s body and smothered him with his (Rasheed\u2019s) shirt. He instructed Ramzan to hold the shirt over Muhammad Noor\u2019s mouth, and as Ramzan was doing so, Rasheed strangled the accused with a string, described in court as a \u2018nara\u2019 or the string that comes with Punjabi pants. Rasheed had also testified that it was Ramzan who took his (Rasheed\u2019s) shirt and covered Muhammad Noor\u2019s face.",
      "8": "A/P Lau testified that the marks on Muhammad Noor\u2019s neck may have been caused by strangulation with the nara. But he said that death was not caused by that strangulation, but by asphyxia caused by the smothering of Muhammad Noor\u2019s face with the shirt. Muhammad Noor had most likely already stopped breathing by the time he was strangled.",
      "9": "The incontrovertible fact is that Muhammad Noor was asphyxiated to death by either Rasheed or Ramzan. From the evidence of both men, I find that it was Ramzan who smothered Muhammad Noor, and Rasheed strangled him with his hands and the nara. The question is whether the two men had formed the intention to kill Muhammad Noor before they attacked him.",
      "10": "Call screening records showed that two calls were exchanged between Rasheed and Ramzan on 11 June 2014 before the attack. Rasheed had called Ramzan at 1:01am for 13 seconds, and Ramzan had called Rasheed at 1:46am for 10 seconds. Rasheed and Ramzan admitted to calling each other that night in their oral testimony. However, Rasheed claimed that he had called Ramzan to tell Ramzan that he would not help him attack Muhammad Noor. Ramzan claimed that the phone calls were only about coming up to Room 44 to gamble.",
      "11": "Rasheed and Ramzan denied any intention to kill. Ramzan testified that as far as he was concerned, they were only scaring Muhammad Noor. He had hoped to snatch Muhammad Noor\u2019s money and then run away. But when he saw Rasheed taking out the nara, he (Ramzan) became frightened and ran out of the room without taking any of Muhammad Noor\u2019s money. He testified that when he ran out, Rasheed was left alone in the room with Muhammad Noor.",
      "12": "Although Ramzan claimed that he lost all his money to Muhammad Noor and that he had fled Muhammad Noor\u2019s room in fright without taking any of Muhammad Noor\u2019s money, the police found $3,318 in Ramzan\u2019s possession after his arrest.",
      "13": "What really happened in Muhammad Noor\u2019s room no one may know for certain, except that Muhammad Noor was killed by either Rasheed or Ramzan, with the other assisting in the homicide. Both men now blame each other and both have given contradictory statements, not only to the police, but in court. There is no clear or direct evidence as to who smothered Muhammad Noor\u2019s face with a shirt till his death.",
      "14": "I accept A/P Lau\u2019s evidence that Muhammad Noor was killed by asphyxiation. He was also strangled by the nara that belonged to Rasheed. Rasheed claimed that he used his hands and the nara to strangle Muhammad Noor. Ramzan claimed that when Rasheed took out the nara, he (Ramzan) got frightened and ran out of the room. But Muhammad Noor was not killed by the nara. He was killed by the smothering of his face. Ramzan admitted to this, perhaps not knowing A/P Lau\u2019s evidence pins the direct cause to the person who smothered Muhammad Noor. Without A/P Lau\u2019s evidence, it might have been understandable for them to think that the man who strangled Muhammad Noor with the nara was the one who killed him.",
      "15": "But the prosecution\u2019s case does not depend on which man smothered Muhammad Noor. The charge was one of committing murder by both men having formed the common intention to kill. What is the evidence concerning the intention of the two men? Neither man denied that they were both present in Muhammad Noor\u2019s room the night he was killed. From then on, Rasheed and Ramzan disassociated themselves from the killing. Rasheed claimed that Ramzan took over the act of smothering Muhammad Noor while Rasheed used the nara. His testimony in court differed from his statement to the police made on 15 June 2014, where he claimed that he was sleeping when Ramzan charged into the room and used his (Rasheed\u2019s) shirt to smother Muhammad Noor. Ramzan admitted only to covering Muhammad Noor\u2019s mouth for only a few seconds, before running away from the room. Muhammad Noor was still \u201cperfectly all right\u201d.",
      "16": "The prosecution\u2019s case depends largely on this court drawing the inference of an intention to kill. That inference has to be drawn from facts, some of which are disputed, and some of which dubious and implausible. Short of a clear confession, the inference of intention has to be drawn from the facts that form the clearest picture, and if from that, the inference of an intention to kill is clear without any residual doubt, then the court is bound to find that the intention to kill has been proved.",
      "17": "I do not believe that Rasheed was threatened and frightened into helping Ramzan. He is senior to Ramzan by 18 years. They are at the ages in which the younger man is less likely to lead. Ramzan is only 28 now and had known Rasheed since he was young, by which it was clear that he meant from his boyhood days. I am reinforced in my view that Rasheed was the leader by the manner and appearance of both men in court, particularly when they were being cross-examined.",
      "18": "The threat itself was also not credible. Rasheed\u2019s family was in Pakistan and would therefore have not been easily reachable by Ramzan. Further, Rasheed testified that prior to the attack, he called Ramzan to tell Ramzan that he would not support him. He had therefore made a conscious choice not to submit to Ramzan\u2019s threat. Yet upon receiving Ramzan\u2019s call to inform him that Ramzan was heading up to Room 44, Rasheed immediately chose to return to the room. If Rasheed did not wish to interfere with Ramzan\u2019s plan out of fear, and thus neither warned Muhammad Noor nor locked the door, and that if he had wanted no part in the plan, he could have simply chosen to walk away from the room. Instead, after going out of the room to take the call, he promptly went back into the room to wait for Ramzan after the call, chatting with Muhammad Noor in the meantime. It is far likelier that Rasheed had called Ramzan to come up to Room 44, and Ramzan had later called Rasheed to come out of Room 44, in pursuit of their plan to attack Muhammad Noor.",
      "19": "I also do not believe that Ramzan was outside the room when Muhammad Noor was killed, as he claimed. The plan, as it appears from the evidence, did not require a weapon that could have been wielded by a lone assailant. The plan was to strangle Muhammad Noor with the nara. To prevent him from raising the alarm, they would use Rasheed\u2019s shirt to cover his mouth so that he could not scream for help. Ironically, the smothering killed Muhammad Noor before the nara could do its job. Ramzan\u2019s account that he left the room while Muhammad Noor was \u201cperfectly all right\u201d and shouting is also inconsistent with the lack of any defensive injury found on Muhammad Noor. A/P Lau testified that this implied that he was probably not in a position to have put up any significant resistance against any assailant(s). Had Rasheed been left alone with Muhammad Noor, it is unlikely that Muhammad Noor would not have fought back. At the very least, someone would have heard the commotion.",
      "20": "It seems clear that robbery was the motive to kill, as the money found on both accused persons shows. If there had been no intention to kill, it is unlikely that they took Muhammad Noor\u2019s money on an afterthought. Stealing the victim\u2019s money is an unlikely thought if one had just unintentionally killed another. If robbery was planned, as I find was the case, could they have left Muhammad Noor alive to identify them? Rasheed was Muhammad Noor\u2019s roommate and both of them knew Ramzan and where he lived. There is no doubt that the only option was to kill Muhammad Noor. Smothering and strangling are not actions one associates with the mere intention to frighten a victim.",
      "21": "Rasheed and Ramzan\u2019s actions following Muhammad Noor\u2019s death are also telling. They went together to purchase the luggage bags and saws that were used to dismember Muhammad Noor and stuff his remains into the luggage bags. The video footages and photographs show the two men acting as a team. Not many who have just killed another can be free of internal turmoil or frenzy, but if Rasheed and Ramzan were nervous, that was not apparent.",
      "22": "Ramzan also claimed that he speaks only Urdu and that he had been badly served by an interpreter (Kailash Nath Rai) and a doctor (Dr Jaydip Sarkar) because they were not native Urdu speakers. Kailash Rai was the interpreter for the officers who interviewed Ramzan. Dr Jaydip was the psychiatrist who interviewed Ramzan. Both testified that while Hindi was their native language, spoken Hindi and Urdu are similar and Urdu and Hindi speakers are able to understand each other. They had no difficulty communicating with Ramzan in a mixture of northern Indian languages, mainly Hindi.",
      "23": "Ramzan\u2019s main complaint was that his statement of 18 June 2014 was not made voluntarily, and that he did not understand Hindi. He was not able to persuade me that he had made this statement under coercion or inducement, and I also do not accept his claim that he did not understand Hindi. He had given several statements and there is no record anywhere that he had difficulty understanding the questions. More importantly, if he was unable to communicate in Hindi it can only mean that the lengthy recorded statements by Kailash Rai and Dr Jaydip were created by them. That would be a serious allegation and there is no indication that this was the case.",
      "24": "But I am not relying on the disputed statements to draw the inference of the common intention of both men to kill Muhammad Noor. The motives were common; the plan required two persons. It was not an act that one man could safely and competently execute. I do not think that one man alone could have carried out the dismemberment of Muhammad Noor\u2019s body. As the photographs and evidence of the discarded limbs and torso show, both Rasheed and Ramzan acted in concert after the murder as they did before and during it. The disputed statements merely provide some corroboration of the prosecution\u2019s case that Rasheed and Ramzan carried out their intention to kill Muhammad Noor and rob him of his money.",
      "25": "For the reasons above, I am satisfied that the prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt that Rasheed and Ramzan intended and did kill Muhammad Noor as charged. I therefore find both accused guilty and convict them accordingly."

      "1": "The accused claimed trial to the following charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, an offence under s 299 and punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed):",
      "2": "By way of overview, it was undisputed that the accused knew Mdm Kanne Lactmy (\u201cthe deceased\u201d). On 9 December 2013, the accused went to the deceased\u2019s flat at Yishun (\u201cthe flat\u201d) to borrow money. However, the deceased refused his request. While the deceased was in the kitchen, the accused searched the flat. When he tried to steal a box of jewellery, the deceased caught him in the act. A confrontation ensued, during which the deceased lost her life. The accused did not deny that he caused the deceased\u2019s death. His defence was that he did not have the intention to cause death, only the knowledge that he was likely by his act to cause death, and he should therefore only be found guilty of a lesser offence within s 299, punishable under s 304(b) of the Penal Code.",
      "3": "At the conclusion of the trial, I convicted the accused on the charge. Having heard parties\u2019 submissions on sentence, I sentenced the accused to 18 years\u2019 imprisonment with effect from 17 December 2013, the date he was placed in remand. The accused was more than 50 years old at the time of sentencing. By virtue of s 325(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (\u201cCPC\u201d), he could not be caned. Given the substantial length of imprisonment, I saw no reason to impose an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning.",
      "4": "The accused has filed an appeal against conviction and sentence. The Prosecution has filed an appeal against the sentence imposed. These are the detailed reasons for my decision.",
      "5": "I now summarise the important aspects of the evidence adduced by the Prosecution which expand on the overview of events given at [2] above.",
      "6": "The deceased\u2019s son, Sivakumar s/o Chinapan (\u201cSiva\u201d), testified that between 2000 and 2004, the accused was employed by his elder brother. During that time, the accused came to know Siva\u2019s family. Between 2000 and 2009, the accused attended several family functions at the flat. Over time, the deceased came to treat the accused as a friend. The deceased lived in the flat with Siva, his wife and his daughter. On 9 December 2013, Siva and his family were on holiday in India. Thus, the deceased was alone in the flat that day.",
      "7": "The accused\u2019s wife, Parmeswary A/P Thimparayan (\u201cParmeswary\u201d), gave evidence that as at December 2013, they were staying in a room of a flat in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, which they were renting from Parmeswary\u2019s niece. On 9 December 2013, the accused asked Parmeswary about the payment schedule for their new flat in Johor Bahru. The accused told her he would try to convince his employer to lend them money to finance the payment of their new flat. He also said that he would collect $2,000 in tontine money that day.",
      "8": "The accused left home at 6.30am and returned at about 1.00pm to 2.00pm. The accused told Parmeswary that his employer had agreed to lend him $2,000. The next day, the accused left for work at about 5.00am. At 2.00pm, he called Parmeswary to tell her that he had collected the $2,000 from his employer and also the $2,000 in tontine money. That day, he bought jewellery for her and also redeemed a gold bangle of hers from a pawnshop. Over the next four days, from 11 to 14 December, the accused did not go to work. However, he gave his wife various sums of money, including RM5,000 to pay the deposit for the new flat.",
      "9": "On 17 December 2013, the couple had a heated argument. Parmeswary asked how the accused would be able to return the loan to his employer if he continued to miss work. She insisted on going to Singapore to verify with his employer that he had really taken a loan. While they were at the immigration checkpoint at Woodlands, the accused was placed under arrest.",
      "10": "As part of its case, the Prosecution tendered seven statements recorded from the accused under the CPC. During the recording of all the statements, the accused spoke in Tamil. For the first statement, the accused\u2019s answers in Tamil were directly interpreted and recorded by the recording officer. For the remaining statements, a Tamil interpreter assisted in the process. The Defence did not challenge the admissibility of these statements and they were duly admitted into evidence.",
      "11": "The first statement was recorded on 18 December 2013 at 1.30am by Station Inspector Erulandy Guruthevan, pursuant to s 22 of the CPC. This was the accused\u2019s account of events:\n(a)     On 9 December 2013, he came to Singapore from Johor Bahru at 8.00am. He had consumed three cans of beer before entering Singapore. He went to the flat at about 9.00am.\n(b)     The deceased invited him into the flat. She went into the kitchen to make coffee. While he was having coffee, the deceased went into the kitchen to brush her teeth. As she was doing that, he went to her room without her knowledge, opened the cupboard, and took out \u201cthe jewel box\u201d.\n(c)     While he was taking the jewel box, the deceased suddenly came into the room and asked what he was doing. She said that if he did not hand over the jewel box, she would call her son. The accused told her he needed money. The deceased pulled the box from him. He pushed her onto the floor while holding on to the box. The accused begged the deceased not to inform her son but she continued to say that she would call him.\n(d)     The accused then \u201ctook the pillow and put [it] onto her face and pressed hard\u201d. Shortly after, he \u201cremoved the pillow from her face and she was breathing very fast\u201d. He \u201cgot worried\u201d, and so he took the jewel box and left the house. He returned to Johor Bahru and sold the jewellery for RM26,000.",
      "12": "The second statement \u2013 the cautioned statement \u2013 was recorded at 11.30am by Assistant Superintendent of Police Tan Lee Chye Raymond pursuant to s 23 of the CPC. At that time, the accused had been charged with committing an offence of murder under s 300, punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code. After the charge was read to him, he said this in response:",
      "13": "The third, fourth and fifth statements were recorded by Inspector Razali bin Razak (\u201cInspector Razali\u201d) at 9.20am on 20 December 2013, 2.20pm on 20 December 2013, and 1.10pm on 22 December 2013 respectively. Read together, these three statements provide a detailed account of what happened when the accused was in the flat with the deceased.",
      "14": "According to the accused, he had gone to the flat at about 8.00am with the intention of borrowing $3,000 either from Siva or, if Siva was not around, from the deceased. A month earlier, he had asked his boss for a $2,000 loan but was refused. He had not made any arrangement with Siva or the deceased beforehand.",
      "15": "The accused left his house in Johor Bahru at about 6.00am. On the way to Singapore he bought and consumed three cans of \u201cClipper\u201d beer. On arriving in Singapore, he made his way to the flat by bus. When he reached the flat, the deceased invited him in. She smelt alcohol on his breath and offered to make him some coffee.",
      "16": "As the accused was having his coffee, he told the deceased that he needed to borrow $2,000 to $3,000 to pay the deposit for his new flat. The deceased replied that she did not have so much money. The deceased then said that she wanted to brush her teeth and entered the toilet in the kitchen. While she was inside, the accused searched each of the three rooms in the flat for jewellery or money. He found nothing in the first two rooms. He then entered the master bedroom. He forced open the locked cupboard door, searched the cupboard, and found a box containing jewellery. He decided to \u201csteal them\u201d.",
      "17": "As he was holding the box, the deceased went into the master bedroom. Placing the box on the bed, he pleaded with her to let him keep it. He promised to repay her the money in instalments. The deceased refused and asked him to return the box, failing which she would call Siva. He pleaded with her not to do that. He said in his third statement: \u201cAt that time I did not know what to do. All I was thinking about was my money problem.\u201d The deceased came closer to him. He used both his hands \u201cto push her shoulder very hard\u201d such that she fell backward and landed on the floor.",
      "18": "In his third statement, the accused gave this description of what he did to the deceased while she was on the floor:",
      "19": "This account should be read with the following explanation in the fourth statement. The accused had been asked to elaborate on what he had done to the deceased while she was on the floor and said this in response:",
      "20": "The accused also claimed that he had used his left hand to grab \u201cher neck below the jaw\u201d hard enough that he got tired after three to four minutes. However, he did not \u201csqueeze\u201d her neck as his left hand was weak from having been injured in a road traffic accident in the 1980s. When asked to estimate the amount of force he had used to press the pillow against the deceased\u2019s face, he responded that he could not, though he did say that after some time he started to perspire and the deceased stopped struggling. After he removed his left hand from the deceased\u2019s neck, the accused used both his left and right hands to press the pillow against the deceased\u2019s face. The pillow was in a horizontal position the entire time.",
      "21": "The accused was asked what would happen to a person who was prevented from breathing normally. His response was that the person would die. Similarly, the accused was asked what would happen to a person who was \u201csuffocated or \u201cstrangled\u201d and his response was that \u201cthe person will die because of lack of oxygen\u201d. However, he claimed that when he pressed a pillow against the deceased\u2019s face and grabbed her neck hard, his intention was \u201cto stop her from struggling\u201d; he did not think about the consequences of his action as he was thinking about his \u201cmoney problem\u201d.",
      "22": "To return to what happened once the accused saw the deceased gasping for breath, the accused said that he \u201cgot scared\u201d and placed the jewellery box in his sling bag, wore his blue jacket with the attached hood, and left the house. He then returned to Johor Bahru. The next day, 10 December 2013, he pawned the jewellery he had stolen for RM26,000. He and his wife then paid RM5,000 for the deposit for the new flat. He also purchased a gold chain for his wife. On the morning of 17 December 2013, he quarrelled with his wife. She was angry with him for not going to work and for drinking. His wife said it would be best if he stayed with his sister in Singapore. He disagreed, but his wife insisted. He was arrested when he reached the Singapore customs checkpoint.",
      "23": "I now come to the sixth statement which was recorded by Inspector Razali on 22 December 2013 at 3.10pm. In the course of the recording of this statement, the accused demonstrated what he had done to the deceased. Specifically, he demonstrated two distinct positions.\n(a)     In the first position (\u201cPosition 1\u201d), he used his right hand to press the pillow against the deceased\u2019s face while using his left hand to grab the deceased\u2019s neck region. This position is meant to correspond to what was described at [18]\u2013[20] above.\n(b)     In the second position (\u201cPosition 2\u201d), he used both hands to press the pillow covering the deceased\u2019s face. His hands were pressing down on the parts of the pillow to the side of the deceased\u2019s face, rather than on the deceased\u2019s face itself. This position is meant to correspond to what was described at the latter part of [20] above.",
      "24": "The seventh statement, recorded by Inspector Razali on 23 December 2013 at 4.50pm, was less material to the present proceedings. In it, the accused provided information on his family, educational and work backgrounds. He said that he had studied until Primary Four. Thereafter, he had worked at various odd jobs.",
      "25": "The deceased was found by Gayisin Simi (\u201cGayisin\u201d), a domestic worker in the employment of the deceased\u2019s neighbour. At about 12.00pm, Gayisin received a telephone call from the deceased\u2019s younger sister saying that she could not contact the deceased. Gayasin went to the flat to check on the deceased. As the keys to the door had been left inside the padlock, Gayisin unlocked the door and entered the flat. She found the deceased lying unresponsive on the floor of her bedroom. Gayasin called for an ambulance and reported the matter to the police. At around 12.26pm, paramedics from the Singapore Civil Defence Force arrived at the flat. They performed cardio-pulmonary resuscitation on the deceased but did not detect any pulse. The deceased was conveyed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital where, after further attempts at resuscitation, she was officially pronounced dead at 1.30pm.",
      "26": "On 10 December 2013, Dr Marian Wang (\u201cDr Wang\u201d), a consultant forensic pathologist with the Health Sciences Authority, performed an autopsy on the deceased. According to the autopsy report, the cause of the deceased\u2019s death was manual strangulation, as evidenced by external and internal neck injuries.",
      "27": "The significant external neck injuries were:\n(a)     four bruises on the front of the neck; namely:\n(i)       a 4 x 3cm bruise on the right side of the jawline;\n(ii)       a 4 x 3cm bruise just below the left side of the jawline;\n(iii)       a 6 x 2cm bruise at the middle level of the anterior aspect of the neck across the midline (more prominent on the left side);\n(iv)       a 2 x 2cm bruise on the middle level of the left lateral aspect of the neck; and\n(b)     a scratch abrasion across the front of the neck.",
      "28": "The significant internal neck injuries included:\n(a)     haemorrhage of the internal neck muscles;\n(b)     haemorrhage of the tissue surrounding the left vagus nerve;\n(c)     haemorrhage of the thyroid gland;\n(d)     a fracture of the hyoid bone; and\n(e)     a fracture of the thyroid cartilage.",
      "29": "Dr Wang also found subconjunctival haemorrhage in both the deceased\u2019s eyes. There was also a bruise at the back of her head, multiple bruises on the back of her hands, a few bruises over her forearms, one bruise on each shoulder and a couple of bruises around the left clavicle.",
      "30": "As Dr Wang explained, there were three relevant ways in which manual strangulation could result in death: compression of a person\u2019s blood vessels (which deprives the brain of oxygenation from fresh blood), compression of a person\u2019s airway (which prohibits gaseous exchange into the lungs) and vagus nerve stimulation. In the case of the death of the deceased, the two former mechanisms were present.",
      "31": "Compression of the blood vessels was evidenced by the subconjunctival haemorrhage in the deceased\u2019s eyes \u2013 also referred to as petechial haemorrhage. Such haemorrhaging would usually be due to the compression of blood vessels in the neck resulting in back-damming of the blood from the face. As for compression of the airway, this was evidenced by the fractures to the deceased\u2019s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage, which formed part of the skeleton of the airway.",
      "32": "In Dr Wang\u2019s opinion, only the application of \u201csignificant or severe force\u201d could have caused these fractures because the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage are bony structures which are not directly beneath the skin, but buried deep within the throat, covered by muscles (in fact, multiple layers of muscles) and then skin.",
      "33": "The accused was examined by Dr Stephen Phang (\u201cDr Phang\u201d), a senior consultant psychiatrist with the Institute of Mental Health, on four occasions in January 2014. Dr Phang produced a psychiatric report dated 30 January 2014 in which he concluded that the accused was \u201cnot of unsound mind\u201d at the time of the offence, that his \u201cmental responsibility was not in any way diminished then\u201d, and that he was presently fit to plead. Specifically, he made the following observations in his report:\n(a)     The accused had a noticeable stutter (which was present whether he spoke in English or Tamil). However, he showed no psychotic symptoms and was not found to be labouring under any cognitive deficits of note.\n(b)     A CT scan of the accused\u2019s brain was taken on 14 January 2014. This revealed the presence of a developmental venous anomaly (\u201cDVA\u201d) in the accused\u2019s left frontal lobe. Notwithstanding this finding, Dr Phang\u2019s view was that the accused\u2019s brain scan was normal.\n(c)     Upon assessment of the accused\u2019s intellectual functioning, the accused was not found to have met the criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability. As Dr Phang explained in giving evidence, to be described as \u201cintellectually disabled\u201d, one generally needed to be in the bottom 1% of the population, whereas the accused\u2019s overall intellectual ability placed him in the bottom 5% of the population. Notwithstanding his low intellectual ability, Dr Phang\u2019s view was that the accused was not observed to have any deficits in executive functioning.\n(d)     The accused did not suffer from any formal psychiatric or mental illness. He had a history of alcohol dependence syndrome, and was a chronic alcoholic. However, his alcohol abuse did not in any way affect his mental responsibility at or around the time of the alleged killing.",
      "34": "As will be explained below, the Defence contended, inter alia, that the accused suffered from frontal lobe dysfunction. For convenience, I will return to the evidence of Dr Phang and two other prosecution witnesses concerning the accused\u2019s mental condition at [44] below.",
      "35": "At the close of the Prosecution\u2019s case, I found that there was sufficient evidence upon which to call upon the accused to give evidence in his own defence. The accused\u2019s testimony was largely consistent with what he had said in his statements. It is only necessary to highlight the parts of his examination-in-chief and cross-examination where he gave a different account from his statements in relation to what he had done to the deceased, as follows:\n(a)     He said that the deceased began to shout once he refused to return the box. She shouted that she would call Siva. Later, in cross-examination, he also said that the deceased shouted: \u201cGive the jewel box.\u201d He said that when he pushed her onto the floor, she was shouting too. It will be noted that in his statements, the accused did not mention that the deceased was \u201cshouting\u201d, at least not explicitly.\n(b)     He was shown one of the photos taken of his re-enactment of Position 1, in which he had his left hand around the area of a mannequin\u2019s neck. He demonstrated in court that his left hand was below the chin.\n(c)     He was asked why he had moved from Position 1 to Position 2. His answer was this: \u201cBecause head never and then fast left and right. Shout left hand, shout right hand. So I held. So I did this. I kept like this. Shaking head.\u201d He clarified that it was the deceased\u2019s head that was shaking.\n(d)     When shown a photo of him in Position 2 and asked what he was trying to do in that position, he said: \u201cAgain her head, here and there she shook. So I kept it straight in order not to shout.\u201d\n(e)     When asked why he had stopped holding his hands in Position 2, he explained: \u201cI saw she hand and leg I saw was not shaking.\u201d\n(f)     During cross-examination, when he was referred to the paragraph from his third statement reproduced at [18] above, he replied \u201c[n]ot the neck\u201d and then pointed to the area under his chin. It was not quite clear whether he was referring to the chin or the jaw, but counsel for both sides agreed that there was no material difference in describing it as either the chin or the jaw. When asked again, the accused maintained that his left hand had been on the deceased\u2019s jaw with his fingers along the jawline.",
      "36": "The Defence adduced evidence from Dr John Bosco Lee (\u201cDr Lee\u201d), a forensic psychiatrist in practice at Adelphi Psych Medicine Clinic, and Dr Matthew Woo (\u201cDr Woo\u201d), a principal consultant clinical psychologist at the same clinic, to establish that the accused suffered from frontal lobe dysfunction.",
      "37": "The Defence submitted that frontal lobe dysfunction was established based on three factors: (a) the identification of the DVA on the accused\u2019s CT scan; (b) a diagnosis that he suffered from expressive dysphasia (which was indicative of left frontal lobe deficits); and (c) results from neuropsychological assessments suggesting that he had executive deficits consistent with left frontal lobe issues.",
      "38": "As regards the DVA, it was not disputed that the CT scan showed the presence of a DVA in the accused\u2019s left frontal lobe. According to Dr Lee, this was an abnormal CT scan.",
      "39": "As regards expressive dysphasia, Dr Lee explained that a person who has expressive dysphasia has difficulty \u201cin getting words and organising words so as to be able to effectively express his idea\u201d. He assessed that the accused was suffering from this based on the fact that, during his interactions with the accused, the accused had difficulties expressing himself on several occasions, and would stop in his speech to spell out the word. He listed occasions where the accused had (a) used his finger to write the letter \u201cw\u201d in the air when trying to say his name; (b) used his finger to write the numbers \u201c7\u201d and \u201c5\u201d in the air when speaking of his birth year (1967) or the year his wife bought a flat (2015); and (c) spelt out seven specific words instead of saying them.",
      "40": "As regards executive deficits, Dr Woo conducted neuropsychological assessments. In a report dated 24 October 2016, Dr Woo\u2019s conclusions were that (a) in terms of intellectual functioning, the accused was in the borderline range; (b) in terms of memory functioning, the accused was impaired in verbal modalities but had intact visuospatial skills; and (c) in terms of executive functioning, the accused had deficits \u201cresulting in difficulties with planning (problem solving), self-control (inhibition), expression (verbal fluency) and mental flexibility\u201d.",
      "41": "The first two findings by Dr Woo were not contentious. However, his conclusion on the accused\u2019s executive functioning deficits was disputed, and I therefore elaborate on the observations made by Dr Woo. Dr Woo\u2019s view was based on the accused\u2019s performance on a number of neuropsychological tests, in particular the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (\u201cWCST\u201d) and the Controlled Word Association Test (\u201cCOWAT\u201d).",
      "42": "As to the accused\u2019s performance on the WCST, Dr Woo noted that \u201cmental flexibility was impaired, with severe losses in the ability to shift sets related to inhibition functions\u201d. I should explain the significance of the accused\u2019s failure to \u201cshift sets\u201d. As I understood it, the WCST tests an examinee\u2019s perseveration by making him sort a stack of cards (each containing some picture) according to a certain principle, say, by colour. The examinee does not know the sorting principle; all the tester does is to tell him when he sorts a card whether he is right or wrong. After the examinee sorts a number of cards correctly, the sorting principle changes. The examinee will then have to figure out how to sort the cards by the new category. Perseveration is indicated by the examinee\u2019s inability to sort the cards according to the new category. His response of sorting the cards according to the previous category is \u201cperseverated\u201d and he is thus unable to sort the cards according to the new category; he is unable to \u201cshift sets\u201d. This in turn is an indicator of the examinee\u2019s inhibition and self-control. Dr Woo was of the view that the accused\u2019s performance on the WCST showed that he had strong signs of perseveration, since his perseverative error score was within the severely impaired range.",
      "43": "Dr Woo added that the assessment results of the WCST and other tests (besides the COWAT) provided \u201csome evidence of executive/frontal deficits, and account for [the accused\u2019s] problems with verbal fluency on the COWAT and expressive difficulties during the assessment process\u201d. Finally, Dr Woo added that the accused\u2019s history of drinking problems might have contributed to his deficits in executive functioning.",
      "44": "With that, I return to the Prosecution\u2019s evidence, beginning with that of Dr Goh Chin Kong (\u201cDr Goh\u201d), a consultant radiologist at Changi General Hospital, who had verified and finalised a radiology report based on the CT scan of the accused\u2019s brain. Dr Goh testified that the DVA had no pathological significance in a patient who was asymptomatic (such as the accused). The DVA was a normal variant representing venous drainage in the brain. Dr Goh disagreed with Dr Lee\u2019s conclusion that the accused had \u201cfrontal lobe dysfunction caused by an organic lesion\u201d because it was highly likely, based on the CT scan, that there was no such organic lesion. In this connection, Dr Goh testified that the DVA seen in the accused\u2019s CT scan was not in the area of the brain associated with motor speech functions \u2013 what is known as Broca\u2019s area.",
      "45": "Regarding expressive dysphasia, Dr Phang\u2019s view was that the accused\u2019s stutter or stammer was not expressive dysphasia. Expressive dysphasia referred to a loss or impairment in the production of language due to significant pathology in Broca\u2019s area (as Dr Goh had also explained). A person with expressive dysphasia would have speech that was very sparse, laboured, slow and hesitant; there would be disturbances in inflection and rhythm; and function words like prepositions, pronouns and verbs might even be dropped from speech. In short, the person would have marked and obvious difficulties in carrying out normal communication or conversation. Dr Phang did not observe such features in the accused\u2019s speech when he interviewed him.",
      "46": "Furthermore, as Dr Phang noted, expressive dysphasia was commonly associated with a pathological condition in the left frontal lobe of the brain, but the accused\u2019s brain\u2019s scan was normal. In this regard, Dr Phang, like Dr Goh, disagreed with the significance attached by Dr Lee to the DVA. Dr Phang\u2019s view was also that the detection of the DVA was an incidental radiological finding bearing no clinical significance. Dr Phang said that despite noting the identification of the DVA in the radiology report, he did not pursue any further investigation \u2013 this was because the chances of it leading to any issues or problems and functioning were \u201cvirtually non-existent\u201d.",
      "47": "After the close of the Defence\u2019s case, the Prosecution made an application to call Dr Kenji Gwee (\u201cDr Gwee\u201d), a principal clinical forensic psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health, as a rebuttal witness. The Defence did not object to this application. Dr Gwee questioned Dr Woo\u2019s reliance on the accused\u2019s performance on the WCST and COWAT as indicators that the accused had deficits in executive functioning. In Dr Gwee\u2019s view, the WCST was a complex test that measured multiple domains of neuropsychological function, including abstract reasoning. Thus, the accused might have performed poorly on the WCST because he did not have the abstract reasoning required to perform the test, and not because he had problems with inhibition. In respect of the accused\u2019s problems with verbal fluency on the COWAT, Dr Gwee commented that problems with verbal fluency did not necessarily mean the accused lacked inhibition; verbal fluency and inhibition are two domains of executive functioning with no explicit link.",
      "48": "With that, I turn to the law. Section 299 of the Penal Code provides:",
      "49": "Therefore, to constitute an offence within s 299, the actus reus is that of doing an act which causes death. As for the mens rea of the offence, s 299 contains three distinct limbs.",
      "50": "The Prosecution framed the charge based on the first limb \u2013 that of \u201cthe intention of causing death\u201d. To establish the charge as framed, the Prosecution bore the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused did an act which caused the death of the deceased, and that the accused did the act with the intention of causing death. This would be punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code.",
      "51": "The Defence, though not disputing that the accused committed the act which caused death, argued that the accused did not intend to cause the deceased\u2019s death. Instead, the accused only knew that his actions were likely to cause the deceased\u2019s death, being the third limb within s 299 \u2013 that of \u201cknowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death\u201d [emphasis added]. If the accused only had the knowledge that his act was likely to cause death, he would be guilty of what would in effect be a less serious offence under s 299 which would be punishable under s 304(b) of the Penal Code.",
      "52": "I set out the punishment prescribed by s 304 of the Penal Code:",
      "53": "As regards proving the mens rea, the inquiry under the first limb of s 299 is fully subjective (PP v Sutherson, Sujay Solomon [2016] 1 SLR 632 (\u201cSutherson\u201d) at [46(a)]. Thus, factors specific to the accused, such as any mental condition, should be taken into account. Yet intention is rarely proven by direct evidence and inevitably has to be inferred from the surrounding circumstances. Thus, when determining if there was intention to kill, the court must consider all the relevant and admissible evidence, and the relevant personal characteristics of the accused. The relevant evidence would include an accused\u2019s evidence in court, what he told the police and the evidence of other witnesses. Importantly, it would also include the nature of the acts themselves: the type of weapon used (if any), the nature, location and number of injuries and the way the injuries were inflicted (see Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan & Chan Wing Cheong, Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2012) at paras 9.27\u20139.29).",
      "54": "In this regard, I should also state that in the context of a murder charge under s 300(a) of the Penal Code, it is well settled that an intention to cause death can be formed on the spur of the moment, just before the actual killing takes place, and does not have to be pre-planned or premeditated: Iskandar bin Rahmat v PP [2017] 1 SLR 505 at [34]. I am of the view that this observation is equally applicable in the context of an inquiry into whether an offender has the intention to cause death for the purpose of the offence under s 299 since, as I noted in Sutherson at [46(a)], the fault element under s 300(a) maps onto the first limb of s 299.",
      "55": "By and large, parties did not dispute the applicable legal principles. However, there were disputes over the exact manner in which the accused carried out the acts which caused death, and much disagreement over the evidence of the forensic pathologist, psychiatrists and psychologists. Based on their opposing positions on the contested evidence, parties contested the mens rea possessed by the accused at the material time. Given the conflict in opinion between the Prosecution\u2019s and the Defence\u2019s expert witnesses, it is useful to add that where there is such a conflict, the court\u2019s role is restricted to choosing one of the conflicting views; it cannot substitute its own views. At the same time, a court should not accept expert evidence unquestioningly but must test it against the objective facts of the case (see Sakthivel Punithavathi v PP [2007] 2 SLR(R) 983 at [76]).",
      "56": "With that, I now turn to my analysis and findings. On the actus reus, as stated above, there was no dispute that the accused\u2019s act caused the deceased\u2019s death. However, there were two disputed aspects of how the attack took place. As will be seen, these were also relevant to the issue of the accused\u2019s mens rea. Thus, I set out my findings on these disputed aspects.",
      "57": "First, the Defence argued that the accused only grabbed the deceased by her jaw or chin, and not by the neck. The accused pressed against her jaw or chin to stop her from shouting. This factual dispute was raised in the context of a submission that the accused did not intend to strangle the deceased. I rejected this claim and accepted the Prosecution\u2019s submission that he had grabbed the deceased by the neck. In other words, I found that the accused had strangled the accused. This was clearly borne out by the contents of the accused\u2019s statements to the police, and the objective evidence of the neck injuries suffered by the deceased.",
      "58": "In the first two statements, the accused did not mention that he had strangled the deceased. He only admitted to having suffocated her with the pillow. However, in the third, fourth and fifth statements, the accused stated that he had used his left hand to grab the deceased\u2019s neck (see [18]\u2013[20] above). When asked by the court whether he knew the Tamil words for \u201cneck\u201d and \u201cjaw\u201d, the accused replied that he knew the Tamil word for \u201cneck\u201d but not for \u201cjaw\u201d. The Defence suggested that the accused\u2019s ignorance of the Tamil word for \u201cjaw\u201d accounted for his repeated use of the word \u201cneck\u201d in his statements.",
      "59": "I did not accept this submission. I noted that the accused used the word \u201cjaw\u201d on one occasion in his statement. To a specific question about how he grabbed the deceased\u2019s neck, he said that he grabbed \u201cher neck below the jaw\u201d (see [20] above). This indicated that there was no confusion during the recording of the statements between the words \u201cneck\u201d and \u201cjaw\u201d, and that the accused was aware of the distinction between the two words. Even at this point in the statement, he did not say that he only grabbed the deceased\u2019s jaw, but was saying that he was grabbing the deceased\u2019s neck.",
      "60": "Next, in cross-examination, the accused claimed that during the recording of his statements, he merely demonstrated the movement with his left hand to the interpreter without saying the word \u201cneck\u201d, and that based on his demonstration, the interpreter recorded him as saying that he grabbed the neck of the deceased. If indeed the accused merely demonstrated the movement, his claim would be that the interpreter (and Inspector Razali who recorded the statements) wrongly referred to him grabbing the deceased\u2019s \u201cneck\u201d rather than her \u201cjaw\u201d when recording his statements. In my view, this was quite contrived, given the multiple occasions on which he had a chance to correct the statements if they were inaccurate. In my view, the accused\u2019s claim that he had only grabbed the deceased\u2019s jaw and not the neck was a disingenuous attempt to downplay the gravity of his act.",
      "61": "The Defence argued that during the re-enactment of Position 1 (see [23(a)] above), two photographs taken of the re-enactment (P132 and P133) showed that his left hand had only made contact with the jawline of the deceased without touching her neck. I did not quite agree with the observation. It is true that in these two photographs, the tip of the accused\u2019s left thumb and his fingers could be seen to extend to the jawline. Nevertheless, his hand appeared to reach around the neck region. The two photographs certainly did not show the accused merely trying to push the jaw or the chin of the deceased to stop her from shouting. Rather, in my view, the depictions were broadly consistent with the references in his earlier statements of having grabbed the deceased\u2019s neck.",
      "62": "In any case, the accused\u2019s claim that he had only grabbed the deceased\u2019s jaw became plainly unsustainable once I factored in the objective evidence, in the form of Dr Wang\u2019s autopsy findings, that the deceased suffered multiple injuries to her neck. As mentioned at [27] above, Dr Wang found four external neck injuries on the deceased. It is true that two of the external neck injuries were on the right and left side of the deceased\u2019s jawline. Indeed, the Defence relied on photographs showing the bruises on the bottom left area of the deceased\u2019s jaw and the right side of the deceased\u2019s jawline to submit that the accused must have grabbed the deceased\u2019s jaw, not her neck.",
      "63": "However, these jawline injuries by themselves did not show that the accused grabbed only the jaw, and not the neck. Once I factored in the internal neck injuries, it became clear that the accused must have also grabbed the deceased\u2019s neck. Significantly, as Dr Wang testified, there were fractures of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage. The horns of both the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage were fractured. Since the horns were situated at the side of the neck, there must have been lateral compression for them to have been fractured. This meant that the accused must have pressed down on the side of the deceased\u2019s neck. That said, it was a fair inference to make that the external bruises near the jawline show that, in addition to grabbing the deceased\u2019s neck, the accused also made contact with her right and left jawline.",
      "64": "Nonetheless, to the extent that the Defence\u2019s submission was that the accused only grabbed the deceased\u2019s jaw and not the neck, that submission was unsustainable. Therefore, I found that the accused strangled the deceased. As I mentioned earlier, this factual dispute was raised in the context of the submission that there was no intention by the accused to strangle the deceased \u2013 the implication being that there was therefore no intention to kill her. Again, I did not accept this. From the accused\u2019s statements, it was quite clear that the accused intended to grab the deceased\u2019s neck, ie, to strangle her. In this regard, I also refer to my observations below that, based on the significant force used, as well the duration of the act of strangling, the accused had the intention to kill the deceased.",
      "65": "I come to the second area of dispute. The Defence disputed Dr Wang\u2019s opinion that the nature of the deceased\u2019s injuries showed that the accused had used a significant or severe amount of force. I rejected that submission. I found that the accused grabbed the neck of the deceased with significant force that was sufficient to cause fractures in skeletal structures which Dr Wang described as being buried deep within the throat (see [32] above).",
      "66": "The Defence argued that Dr Wang\u2019s conclusion that significant force was used was undermined by her concessions that: (a) the classification of force as \u201csignificant\u201d, \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cmild\u201d depended on one\u2019s definition of these terms, and no objective evidence had been led by the Prosecution to measure such descriptions; (b) the fractures could have been caused by a single instance of pressure instead of sustained pressure; (c) the fractures in question could have been caused relatively easily due to the size, location and shape of the bones and the deceased being older in age, thus making her more susceptible to fractures due to the brittleness of her bones; (d) the fractures did not cause the death of the deceased; and (e) there was no forensic evidence of the amount of force applied to the blood vessels in the deceased\u2019s neck.",
      "67": "I will address these arguments in turn. On the first point, Dr Wang explained that forensic pathologists classified the amount of force used into three categories: mild force would cause a skin bruise but no internal haemorrhaging, moderate force would cause a skin bruise with some underlying muscular bruising, and severe force would cause skeletal fractures. Therefore, by the classification, the force used by the accused would have been severe since there was fracturing of a bone, although she added that it would \u201creally [depend] on how you define severe, moderate or mild\u201d. The Defence sought to challenge Dr Wang by suggesting that the appropriate classification of the force applied to the deceased\u2019s neck was \u201cmoderate\u201d. However, the Defence did not produce any evidence to challenge Dr Wang\u2019s classification, as a forensic pathologist, of the force as \u201csevere\u201d. In any case, the more important point established was that the force used by the accused was sufficient to cause deeply embedded skeletal fractures.",
      "68": "Turning to the second point, although Dr Wang agreed with Defence counsel that the fractures could be caused by an instantaneous or brief application of pressure, she did so after explaining that fracturing even a small bone such as the hyoid bone would require a significant amount of force. She was not conceding that the brief application of force meant that the force was insignificant.",
      "69": "As for the third point, the size or shape of the bones was not material. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, even the fracture of a \u201csmall bone\u201d needed significant force. As for the deceased\u2019s age, Dr Wang had explained that the difference in the amount of force required to cause such fractures in a younger individual was not much more than would be needed with an older individual.",
      "70": "The fourth and fifth points can be taken together. The fact that the skeletal fractures did not cause the deceased to die did not have any bearing on the question of the amount of force needed to cause the skeletal fractures. As Dr Wang explained a few times, the predominant cause of death would have been occlusion of blood vessels. One can have manual strangulation leading to death without any of the fractures. The presence of fractures was simply a marker of the force applied but had no bearing on the fatality of the occlusion of the vessels.",
      "71": "I turn to the point on whether or not the accused\u2019s left hand was weak because of an old injury. In my view, the Defence\u2019s reliance on the accused\u2019s left hand being \u201cweak\u201d did not advance its case. Whether or not the accused\u2019s left hand was \u201cweak\u201d, he was capable of causing the injuries to the deceased\u2019s neck as detailed in the autopsy report. As mentioned, these included fractures of the skeletal structure necessitating the application of a significant amount of force.",
      "72": "I now explain why I found that the accused had intended to cause the death of the deceased. To reiterate, I noted that the Defence did not deny that the accused had knowledge that the acts would likely cause the death of the deceased. However, the Defence contended that all the accused had was that knowledge and not the intention to cause the death of the deceased. I did not accept this contention. It was abundantly clear to me that the accused had the intention to cause the death of the deceased. This conclusion rested on three factors:\n(a)     First, the nature of the accused\u2019s acts. The accused had not only strangled the deceased but suffocated her. In this regard, I have already found (see [63]) that the accused had strangled the deceased, and that he had intended to do so. In his statements, the accused admitted to knowing that either strangulation or suffocation alone could cause a person to die (see [21] above). I should add that this was consistent with the medical evidence. Dr Wang explained that manual strangulation would cause death if the brain were deprived of oxygen for four to five minutes, and that if such strangulation was accompanied by suffocation with a pillow, there would be both occlusion of the nose and mouth and compression of the neck, resulting in death occurring faster. The accused\u2019s use of both strangulation and suffocation therefore supported the inference that he intended to cause death.\n(b)     Second, the duration of the accused\u2019s acts. The accused had strangled and suffocated the deceased for a prolonged period of time. In his statements, he said that he had strangled her for three to four minutes, all the while suffocating her, and then continued suffocating her after that, resulting in a total of ten minutes of suffocation. I appreciated that the lengths of time the accused said he had strangled and suffocated the deceased were his estimates. However, even if these were estimates, they were considerable lengths of time. In any event, during the trial, the accused did not dispute the timings he had provided in the statements.\n(c)     Third, the degree of force used. The severe force the accused had applied in strangling the deceased was evident from two aspects: first, the fractures of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage which I mentioned earlier, and second, his admission that his left hand was tired after three to four minutes of strangling the accused. Whether the tiredness was caused by his left hand being weak was beside the point, which was that he had exerted considerable energy in strangling the deceased. In addition to the significant force he had used in strangling the deceased, the accused had also applied a significant degree of force in suffocating the deceased. This could be seen from his admission that he was perspiring when he had stopped suffocating her after ten minutes.",
      "73": "I should at this juncture deal with the accused\u2019s claim that his intention was to stop the deceased from shouting. As mentioned earlier, the accused testified that the deceased had shouted her threat to call Siva and had continued shouting throughout the time he was in Position 1 and Position 2 (see [35] above). The Prosecution sought to challenge the veracity of the accused\u2019s claim that the deceased had shouted for help before the accused had pushed her onto the floor. It was argued that the accused had not, in his statements, mentioned the deceased\u2019s shouting, and that this therefore showed that the deceased had not in fact shouted. I did not agree entirely with the Prosecution. The accused did mention the deceased\u2019s threat to call Siva, even though he did not describe the manner in which she voiced that threat \u2013 whether it was by shouting or otherwise. Furthermore, Dr Phang had recorded, both in his contemporaneous handwritten notes of his interviews with the accused, and the psychiatric report he produced thereafter, that the accused mentioned to him that the deceased had shouted. Therefore, I was prepared to accept that, at some point after the deceased found the accused with the jewellery box, she would have been making noise that was loud enough for the accused to want to silence her.",
      "74": "Even so, I did not agree with the Defence that the accused did not have the intention to cause the deceased\u2019s death because his intention had only been to stop the deceased from shouting. In my view, he chose to silence the accused by causing her death. He was not content merely to muffle the deceased by placing the pillow on her face. He also intentionally grabbed her neck and strangled her forcefully, as can be seen by the deceased\u2019s serious neck injuries. The combination of these two acts, strangulation and suffocation, taken together with the duration and forcefulness of the acts, led me to conclude that the accused intended to cause her death.",
      "75": "The Defence also highlighted that the deceased was gasping for air when the accused removed the pillow from her face, and that the accused did not continue to harm her thereafter. This, the Defence argued, indicated that the accused did not intend to cause the deceased\u2019s death. However, in my view, the fact of the matter was that the accused had already formed the intention to kill the deceased (albeit on the spur of the moment), and had acted on that intention when he strangled and suffocated her for a duration of about ten minutes before he lifted the pillow from her face. While the deceased might not have died before his very eyes, and that the accused chose to flee at that point, this did not detract from my finding of the accused\u2019s relevant state of mind when he committed the act.",
      "76": "I should add that I derived no assistance from the Defence\u2019s attempt to draw a parallel between the present case and Tan Chee Hwee v PP [1993] 2 SLR(R) 493. The two offenders in that case had each been convicted in the High Court of a charge of committing murder under s 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Penal Code 1985\u201d) in furtherance of a common intention. They were both burgling a house when the maid returned sooner than they had expected. There was a struggle between the maid and both offenders. One of them sought to tie up the maid with a rope but the rope broke. The struggle continued and all three of them fell onto the floor. One of the offenders then picked up an electric iron and wanted to wind the cable that was attached to the iron around the maid\u2019s waist so as to tie her up. The cable ended up around the maid\u2019s neck instead, and she died from strangulation by asphyxiation. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision to convict the offenders of the charges under s 300(c), finding that they only had knowledge that their acts were likely to cause death (at [56]). The court therefore convicted them on reduced charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, punishable under s 304(b) of the Penal Code 1985 (at [57]).",
      "77": "There were significant differences between that case and the present. For one, there was in that case a botched attempt to subdue the maid by tying a rope around her. Also, one of the offenders had also tried to place his hand over the maid\u2019s mouth. There was also no evidence of manual strangulation. All these led the court to think that neither offender had any intention to cause hurt to the maid (at [38]). The evidence was consistent with a finding that their aim was only to tie the maid up but not to cause her any hurt (at [46]). Furthermore, the offenders had more lethal tools at their disposal, such as the iron, which they could have used to hit the maid if their aim had truly been to \u201csilence her forever\u201d. That they did not resort to this led the court to find that the injury to the maid around her neck was \u201caccidentally or unintentionally caused\u201d (at [46]).",
      "78": "On the present facts, there was no evidence that the accused had sought to subdue the deceased by less violent means such as by covering her mouth. Instead, he immediately pressed a pillow to her face with one hand and strangled her with the other hand at the same time. Both these acts were intentional. He attacked a vulnerable part of the deceased\u2019s body. He continued to do so for a considerable period of time. In my judgment, the fatal injuries to the deceased\u2019s neck could not be described as accidental or unintentional. Nor it could be said that he was trying to silence the deceased but ended up killing her unintentionally. Rather, as I have said, he wanted to silence her by killing her.",
      "79": "I now turn to discuss the mental condition of the accused. The Defence accepted that, whatever the accused\u2019s condition, it would not have rendered him incapable of forming an intention to cause death. The relevance of his condition was to the overall assessment of whether he had the necessary mens rea of the charge. I considered that nothing in the evidence about the accused\u2019s mental condition detracted from my finding that he had formed the intention to kill the deceased. Nonetheless, I made certain findings pertaining to the disputes over the accused\u2019s mental condition in anticipation that they might be relevant to sentencing.",
      "80": "At the outset, it is important to highlight one thing. At the trial, the Defence focused on three factors (the DVA, expressive dysphasia, and neuropsychological tests indicating executive deficits) to show that the accused suffered from frontal lobe dysfunction. However, ultimately, in the Defence\u2019s submissions, it was the issue of whether the accused suffered executive deficits affecting his inhibition and decision-making capabilities that had significance because it would show that the accused did not have the intention to kill the deceased, only the knowledge that his acts would cause her death. Hence, what was most important in the final analysis was whether the accused suffered from executive deficits. Having said that, I will go on to set out the views I arrived at with regard to the DVA and expressive dysphasia.",
      "81": "First, as regards the DVA, I accepted Dr Goh\u2019s opinion (see [44] above) that the accused\u2019s DVA in and of itself has no pathological significance. I also accepted Dr Phang\u2019s evidence that the presence of the DVA would not have warranted further medical attention or investigation (see [46] above).",
      "82": "Moving on, I found that the accused did not suffer from expressive dysphasia. I accepted Dr Phang\u2019s evidence that during the interviews with the accused, there were no signs or symptoms of expressive dysphasia at all. What Dr Phang observed, as was consistent with his interviews with the accused\u2019s family members, was that the accused had a stutter. Dr Phang had cogently explained the differences between stuttering and expressive dysphasia (see [45] above). The short point is that stuttering has no psychiatric significance and is a far different condition from expressive dysphasia. In this regard, I also accepted Dr Goh\u2019s finding that the accused\u2019s DVA was not sited near Broca\u2019s area of the brain (which is associated with speech function). Therefore, the DVA could not be the cause of any expressive dysphasia (assuming there was any by the time the Defence\u2019s experts assessed the accused).",
      "83": "I turn to Dr Lee\u2019s diagnosis that the accused had expressive dysphasia. This was based on the DVA finding of January 2014, as well as interviews and neuropsychological tests conducted almost three years after the incident. This is at odds with Dr Phang\u2019s assessment. However, Dr Phang\u2019s assessment, as mentioned in his report, has two advantages over that of Dr Lee. First, it was more contemporaneous. Dr Phang interviewed the accused on four different occasions for a total of about seven-and-a-half hours but he did not observe the habit of spelling words. Dr Lee on the other hand observed a few instances where the accused spelt words. I should add here that while giving evidence, the accused also spelt out certain words, and appeared to have some difficulty expressing himself. There seemed to be no explanation for why the accused subsequently developed this habit of spelling words instead of speaking them. However, since the relevant inquiry was into the accused\u2019s mental condition at the time of the offence, I preferred Dr Phang\u2019s account as it was far more contemporaneous. Second, Dr Phang spoke to the accused in English (on the first two occasions) and Tamil (on the latter two occasions through an interpreter). Dr Lee only spoke to the accused in English. Dr Phang had the benefit of observing the accused\u2019s speech in both languages in which he was capable of expressing himself, and did not observe any speech difficulties apart from stuttering.",
      "84": "Even if Dr Lee\u2019s report were to be relied on, I found that his diagnosis did not cast any doubt on Dr Phang\u2019s findings as at January 2014. Expressive dysphasia, as both Dr Phang and Dr Lee agree, is a significant impairment. As I highlighted at [45], Dr Phang explained that the speech of a person with expressive dysphasia would be markedly different from that of a normal person. Dr Lee did not fully align himself with Dr Phang\u2019s description, but accepted at least that expressive dysphasia meant a person would have difficulty putting his ideas and thoughts into words. My understanding, as informed by the experts\u2019 opinions, was that one would expect a person with expressive dysphasia to have problems articulating proper sentences and being understood. It would be a condition immediately noticeable by anyone interacting with that person.",
      "85": "On the available evidence, the accused did not seem to have this problem at the material time. It was telling that other people who were familiar to the accused could not remember any instance where the accused had such problems expressing himself. Parmeswary, his wife who had known him since 2011, could not recall any such instance. Siva, his friend, recalled that the accused could not speak properly in the sense that he would stutter, but nothing more serious than that. Once the experts\u2019 views were tested against such objective evidence, it seemed apparent that Dr Phang\u2019s assessment that the accused did not suffer from expressive dysphasia should be preferred over Dr Lee\u2019s.",
      "86": "Therefore, I found that at the time of the incident, the accused did not have expressive dysphasia. In any case, I also found that on its own, expressive dysphasia \u2013 which is a speech impediment \u2013 would not have affected the accused\u2019s executive functioning in any way. The inability to speak properly would not have affected his control over his decisions.",
      "87": "Leaving aside the issue of verbal fluency (which, like expressive dysphasia, really had no impact on the accused\u2019s executive functioning \u2013 see the opinion of Dr Gwee highlighted at [47] above), the key observation by Dr Woo was that there were significant deficits in \u201cproblem solving\u201d and \u201cinhibition\u201d (see [40] above). Dr Lee shared the view, and expressed this in terms of an opinion that the accused might have shown signs of perseveration on the day of the incident, and was not capable of \u201cknowing where to stop\u201d.",
      "88": "Dr Gwee doubted Dr Woo\u2019s findings, especially the finding of \u201cinhibition\u201d based on the WSCT (see [47] above). Dr Phang also expressed reservations about the findings. Dr Phang based these reservations on the fact that the accused had been able to make the \u201cpurpose-driven\u201d journey from Johor Bahru to Yishun; that he had been able to entreat the deceased to lend him money; that he had been able to wait until the deceased was in the toilet before searching the flat for valuables; and that he was then able to search the flat systematically for valuables. Even the accused\u2019s suffocating of the deceased did not indicate any deficits in executive functioning; this was meant to silence the deceased and was, as Dr Phang described, a \u201cvery practical, purposeful act\u201d.",
      "89": "Given that the accused strangled and suffocated the accused with force and over considerable time as described above, I found that the deficits in problem solving, inhibition and impulsivity, even if present, did not detract from the key finding that the accused formed and had the intention to kill the deceased. Therefore, I saw no need to make a finding on the presence of executive deficits when deciding whether to convict the accused.",
      "90": "In conclusion, I found that the accused possessed the intention to cause the deceased\u2019s death. Given that the charge had been established beyond a reasonable doubt by the Prosecution, I convicted him of the charge. I was prepared, however, in the sentencing process, to consider afresh whether the executive deficits pertaining to problem solving, inhibition and impulsivity (\u201cthe executive deficits\u201d) were present at the time of the offence, and if present, whether they would be of mitigating value. Hence, I asked the parties to address me on this in their submissions on sentence.",
      "91": "As set out above at [51], the prescribed punishment under s 304(a) of the Penal Code for culpable homicide, where an accused person had the intention of causing the death of the deceased, is (a) life imprisonment, with liability for caning; or (b) imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, with liability for a fine or caning.",
      "92": "I highlight four main aspects of the Prosecution\u2019s submissions. First, the Prosecution pressed for the maximum sentence of life imprisonment on the basis that the present case fell within the range of the worst type of cases of culpable homicide. The case was within the range of the worst type of cases because (a) there was a calculated decision to kill the deceased; (b) the deceased was a vulnerable victim; (c) the accused had abused the deceased\u2019s trust; (d) the deceased suffered a vicious attack; and (e) the accused was motivated by greed.",
      "93": "Second, the Prosecution also highlighted the accused\u2019s criminal record. The accused had eight previous convictions:\n(a)     On 8 July 1991, he was convicted of two counts of rape under s 376(1) of the Penal Code 1985, with ten counts of rape under s 376(1) taken into consideration. He was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment and three strokes of the cane per charge, making the total sentence five years\u2019 imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.\n(b)     On 27 December 1994, he was convicted of one count of doing an obscene act under s 294 of the Penal Code 1985. He was sentenced to one month\u2019s imprisonment.\n(c)     On 4 September 1995, he was convicted of one count of theft under s 379 of the Penal Code 1985. He was given a $1,000 fine.\n(d)     On 16 June 2000, he was convicted of one count of theft in dwelling under s 380 of the Penal Code 1985. He was sentenced to two months\u2019 imprisonment.\n(e)     On 3 December 2003, he was convicted of one count of theft in dwelling under s 380 of the Penal Code 1985. He was sentenced to five months\u2019 imprisonment.\n(f)     On 25 August 2004, he was convicted of one count of theft in dwelling under s 380 of the Penal Code 1985. He was sentenced to nine months\u2019 imprisonment.\n(g)     On 29 January 2007, he was convicted of (i) two counts of armed robbery under s 392 read with s 397 of the Penal Code 1985, and sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane per charge; and (ii) one count of carrying an offensive weapon, an offence under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65, 1985 Rev Ed), for which he was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment. The total sentence was six years\u2019 imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. There were two other counts of armed robbery taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.\n(h)     On 23 May 2013, he was convicted of one count of theft in dwelling under s 380 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to six weeks\u2019 imprisonment.",
      "94": "The Prosecution therefore submitted that the accused had a proclivity towards property and violent offences that justified a sentence of life imprisonment.",
      "95": "Third, the Prosecution submitted that the accused had failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that he suffered from a mental condition which affected his capacity for self-control at the time of his criminal act.",
      "96": "Fourth, given that the accused was 50 years of age by the time of sentencing and was not liable for caning, the Prosecution urged the court to impose an additional term of imprisonment of six months in lieu of caning.",
      "97": "In response, the Defence argued, first, that this was not a case which warranted a life imprisonment term. In this connection, the Defence argued that the aggravating factors listed by the Prosecution \u2013 abuse of trust, the vulnerability of the victim, and greed as a motivating factor \u2013 were simply not made out on the present facts.",
      "98": "Second, the Defence argued that the accused\u2019s antecedents did not suggest a proclivity towards violence. Rather, most of his antecedents were for property-related offences. The rape charge was not a violent crime as it was statutory rape based on the \u201cconsent\u201d of his underage girlfriend. The robbery offences involved the accused brandishing a chopper to make shop cashiers give him money but these were not, in the Defence\u2019s view, indicative of a tendency on his part towards actual violence.",
      "99": "Third, the Defence argued that the accused had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that he was suffering from the executive deficits and that there was a causal connection between the executive deficits and his commission of the offence. It urged the court to give due weight to this as a mitigating factor.",
      "100": "Based on sentencing precedents, the Defence urged the court to impose 12 to 14 years\u2019 imprisonment. It also contended that there was no ground to order imprisonment in lieu of caning.",
      "101": "I disagreed with the Prosecution that the accused should be sentenced to life imprisonment. To attract the maximum sentence for any offence, a case has to be one of the worst type of cases for the offence, though it need not be the worst case imaginable (Sim Gek Yong v PP [1995] 1 SLR(R) 185 at [11]\u2013[13]). Having considered the parties\u2019 submissions, I was of the view that the maximum sentence was not warranted for the following main reasons.",
      "102": "First, this was not a premeditated offence and did not involve planning on the part of the accused. The accused\u2019s decision to kill the deceased was made on the spur of the moment. Even when the deceased had caught him stealing the box of jewellery, he did not immediately attack her, but pleaded with her to lend him the jewellery. It was only when she refused, said that she would inform Siva, and came closer to him that he turned violent by pushing her to the ground (see [16] above). As I have found at [72], the deceased would probably have been making some noise after that. The accused then found it necessary to silence her. That was when things took a wrong turn. Indeed, the Prosecution too seemed to implicitly echo this point: it was submitted that \u201c[i]t was only when it was clear that [the deceased] would not let him get away, that the accused found it necessary to silence her\u201d.",
      "103": "I was not persuaded by the Prosecution\u2019s emphasis on the fact that the accused had first asked the deceased for a loan and took the opportunity, while she was in the toilet, to search the house for valuables. This did not establish any planning on his part to kill the deceased. It established, at the most, a plan to rob her. Although, as I said at [91], the Prosecution argued that there was a \u201ccalculated decision\u201d to kill the deceased, it was not clear that the Prosecution meant by this that the killing was a premeditated act. Rather, the Prosecution was simply emphasising in this part of its submissions that once the accused had made up his mind to kill the deceased, he \u201cnever once wavered in his intent and effort to kill her\u201d and saw through the killing with \u201csheer determination\u201d. In my view, this amounted to no more than saying that there was a deliberate intention to kill, which was the very mens rea of the charge. Therefore, I did not see how this could be said to be an aggravating factor. In the premises, and given my observation in the preceding paragraph, I found myself in agreement with the Defence\u2019s characterisation of the events as \u201ca case of a robbery gone wrong\u201d \u2013 and I should add, terribly and tragically wrong.",
      "104": "Second, I found that though the accused\u2019s acts were cruel, the cruelty involved was confined to the very acts which caused death. The Prosecution highlighted that the accused had used not one but two methods (strangulation and suffocation) to kill the deceased, that he had kept at these acts for a prolonged period of time, and that he used a significant amount of force. It will be recalled that these were the same factors that indicated to me that the accused had the intention to kill the deceased (see [71(a)]\u2013[71(c)] above). To my mind, these factors established the intention to kill, and no more. Causing a person\u2019s death intentionally is, by definition, a violent and cruel act. Without doubt, the accused\u2019s acts of prolonged strangulation and suffocation were vicious, and his conduct was not to be condoned. However, there was no exceptional cruelty, and certainly no added element of inhumaneness in the accused\u2019s conduct, which would have placed the case at the end of the spectrum as being one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicide.",
      "105": "Third, I disagreed with the Prosecution on the presence of the other aggravating factors. In particular, the accused had not abused the deceased\u2019s trust. He had initially sought to borrow money from the deceased. When she refused, he then tried to rob her \u2013 this set in motion a train of events which ended with him killing her. I agreed with the Defence that this was an opportunistic crime of theft which escalated in violence and severity based on the circumstances. Nor was greed his motivating force in committing the offence. He had first sought a loan, and as the robbery went wrong, he killed the deceased. I did not think this was a case where the accused had acted purely out of the interest to enrich himself. He had acted to fulfil a financial need. He needed money to make an instalment payment for the flat as he was staying in a rented room with his wife. It would be fair to say that this was not the direst form of need; it would not be of the sort that might persuade a court to extend sympathy to an accused person and regard it as a mitigating factor. All the same, it was not greed, and certainly it was not greed which led to the commission of the offence.",
      "106": "For these reasons, I did not think that the maximum sentence of life imprisonment was warranted. I now turn to consider what the appropriate length of imprisonment should be.",
      "107": "At a general level, it was not disputed by the parties that the sentencing principles of deterrence and retribution were applicable in this case given the heinous nature of the accused\u2019s offence. Further, it was recognised that the facts of culpable homicide cases vary widely and there was no applicable benchmark sentence (see PP v Tan Kei Loon Allan [1998] 3 SLR(R) 679 at [33]). Parties accepted that the appropriate sentence had to be arrived at by taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the case. In this regard, two circumstances were significant.",
      "108": "The first was the accused\u2019s alleged executive deficits. In Chang Kar Meng v PP [2017] 2 SLR 68 at [33], the Court of Appeal reaffirmed the prevailing view that in determining the mitigating value to be attributed to an offender\u2019s mental condition, the court must first ask if the nature of the mental condition was such that the offender retained substantially the mental ability or capacity to control or restrain himself at the time of his criminal acts. If the answer was \u201cyes\u201d and the offender chose not to exercise self-control, the mental condition would be of little or no mitigating value. The question is whether the mental condition affects control and inhibition.",
      "109": "Based on the neuropsychological tests carried out by Dr Woo, I accepted that the accused had proved on a balance of probabilities that he suffered from the executive deficits at the time of the offence. As mentioned, Dr Woo administered two tests, the WCST and the COWAT. I found the COWAT test result less germane. It suggested that the accused lacked verbal fluency. However, I did not think that a person\u2019s difficulties with expressing himself were relevant in determining whether his self-control or inhibition was affected; I alluded to this earlier at [86]. In this regard, I accepted Dr Gwee\u2019s explanation (see [47] above) that verbal fluency was not linked to executive functioning. Indeed, the Defence did not rely on the COWAT in its sentencing submissions to substantiate its argument about the accused\u2019s deficits in executive functioning.",
      "110": "What was more significant was the accused\u2019s performance on the WCST. As explained at [42], based on the WCST, the accused\u2019s perseveration error score was within the severely impaired range. As Dr Woo noted, the results were seven standard deviations below the mean when three standard deviations below the mean would have been sufficient for a finding that he was severely impaired. With respect, I did not think Dr Gwee\u2019s criticism about the accuracy of the WCST as an indicator of the accused\u2019s lack of self-control or inhibition (see [47] above) was persuasive. Dr Gwee suggested that the accused might have performed poorly on the WCST because he did not have the abstract reasoning skills needed to understand what was required of him. However, Dr Woo gave evidence that the accused clearly understood the test. Dr Woo heard the accused trying to verbalise his thoughts about what the correct sorting principle should be. Therefore, I was unable to give much weight to Dr Gwee\u2019s contention that the accused\u2019s poor performance was attributable to other domains other than perseveration.",
      "111": "I acknowledged Dr Phang\u2019s disagreement with Dr Woo\u2019s assessment that the accused had defects in inhibition and problem-solving. Dr Phang based this on his understanding of the accused\u2019s behaviour on the day of the incident (see [87] above). However, and with respect, I preferred the view of the Defence\u2019s expert witnesses for two reasons. First, neither Dr Phang, nor any of the Prosecution\u2019s expert witnesses for that matter, had performed similar tests of executive functioning to show that the accused had no deficits. Although such test results were only, in Dr Phang\u2019s words, \u201ccomplementary but not decisive\u201d, in so far as proof on a balance of probabilities was concerned, given the disagreement between the Prosecution\u2019s and Defence\u2019s expert witnesses, the fact that the Defence had adduced such test results (the reliability of which was not sufficiently undermined by the Prosecution) did tip the scales in its favour.",
      "112": "Second, Dr Phang accepted in cross-examination that the acid test of a person\u2019s executive functioning was in times of stress, and that it was in such stressful times that a person\u2019s impairment in executive functioning might lead him to make a decision that he might not otherwise make. Dr Phang\u2019s judgment that the accused did not suffer from the executive deficits was based largely on the accused\u2019s conduct before he had been caught by the deceased in the act of trying to steal the jewellery box. However, it seemed to me that those actions would be less relevant as indicators of deficits in executive functioning than the actions of the accused when he found himself in a stressful situation, namely when he was caught by the deceased in the act of stealing. As Dr Lee mentioned, that was precisely the time when deficits in executive functioning would manifest themselves, especially in a person of lower intellect.",
      "113": "As for Dr Phang\u2019s characterisation of the suffocation of the deceased as a practical and purposeful act, I did not find that wholly accurate. As I stated earlier at [100], this was not a prearranged crime. The accused was caught red-handed and to prevent the deceased from shouting, the accused silenced her by killing her. Here, it is relevant again to assess the experts\u2019 evidence against the facts. Dr Lee\u2019s assessment that the accused had executive deficits which manifested themselves when he was caught stealing seemed more consistent with the accused\u2019s account, in his statements, of his reaction to being caught. The accused\u2019s statements revealed that he might have acted the way he did because he was fixated on trying to solve his \u201cmoney problem\u201d (see [17] and [21]).",
      "114": "On the whole, I accepted that the accused formed the intention to kill, and acted on that intention, but in my judgment he suffered from executive deficits which caused him to act impulsively in deciding to kill the deceased. Due to these executive deficits, his capacity to control himself was affected. In other words, his focus on trying to obtain the jewellery got the better of him and he then decided, on the spur of the moment, to kill the deceased. In determining the appropriate length of the sentence, I took this into account as a mitigating factor. However, I should stress that this did not cause me to doubt my earlier finding that the accused had the intention to kill the deceased. In my judgment, the decision to kill was made impulsively but the act of killing was done intentionally.",
      "115": "Turning to the accused\u2019s lengthy criminal record, I agreed with the Prosecution that it was of concern, and justified the imposition of a stiff sentence in the interest of specific deterrence. In particular, the accused committed a series of robbery offences in 2007. Based on the charges tendered against him for those offences (copies of which the Prosecution furnished to the court at my request), it was clear that those were also violent crimes: the accused had committed the robberies by threatening to use such weapons as choppers, knives and parangs. It seemed to me that the accused had not been deterred by the relatively stiff sentence of six years\u2019 imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane imposed on 29 January 2007 for that string of offences. A sufficiently long sentence was needed to deter him from committing violent crimes again.",
      "116": "In addition, the accused had a long string of property-related offences. In the present case, arising from his financial desperation, he yet again took to robbery. Although the crime the accused was charged with was not robbery but culpable homicide, he would not have committed the act of killing had he not first formed the intention to rob the deceased. I found therefore that due weight had to be given to the accused\u2019s propensity to commit offences arising from his financial needs, and that this too pointed towards a sufficiently long sentence in the interest of deterrence.",
      "117": "Having made those two observations, I then turned to consider what the appropriate sentence should be based on the sentencing precedents cited by the parties. As a preliminary matter, I noted that in all but one of the following six cases I examined, the offenders faced charges for causing death by doing an act with the intention to cause such bodily injury as was likely to cause death \u2013 ie, the second mens rea limb under s 299 of the Penal Code. The one exception is Dewi Sukowati v PP [2017] 1 SLR 450 (\u201cDewi Sukowati\u201d), where the accused was charged for causing death by doing an act with the intention of causing death \u2013 ie, the first mens rea limb. Nonetheless, I did not think the difference in the charges framed detracted from the relevance of the precedents cited, since under s 304(a) of the Penal Code, the same sentencing range is prescribed for both limbs.",
      "118": "I was of the view that a sentence longer than that of 14 to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, as imposed in the following three cases cited by Defence counsel, was warranted.\n(a)     In PP v Tan Teck Soon [2011] SGHC 137 (\u201cTan Teck Soon\u201d), the 19-year-old offender caused the death of his 20-year-old lover by pushing her over a parapet after a quarrel. The court accepted that the offender\u2019s act was not premeditated but carried out on impulse and took this into consideration in deciding not to impose a sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment but a sentence of 14 years\u2019 imprisonment instead (at [11]). The offender pleaded guilty, and had no criminal record.\n(b)     In PP v Tan Keng Huat Criminal Case No 25 of 2011 (\u201cTan Keng Huat\u201d), the 34-year-old offender killed the deceased by stabbing the latter\u2019s chest and slashing his cheek twice. The killing was essentially an act of retaliation in response to an altercation between the offender\u2019s brother and the deceased at a neighbourhood void deck, in which the deceased beat up the offender\u2019s brother. The offender pleaded guilty, and was found not to have any mental condition. He was sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The court noted that he had a history of prior convictions but not a history of violent crime.\n(c)     In PP v Sumanthiran s/o Selvarajoo [2017] 3 SLR 879 (\u201cSumanthiran\u201d), the 18-year-old offender had attacked an elderly man (64 years of age) who was chanting prayers in a park. This was entirely unprovoked. The offender claimed he was irritated at the sight of the elderly man praying and punched him in the face several times, killing him. He was sentenced to 14 years\u2019 imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane. The offender did not have any previous convictions, but was sentenced for the culpable homicide offence together with three other offences involving violence committed in the preceding year or so. He was a young offender who pleaded guilty.",
      "119": "Broadly speaking, the culpability of the accused here was comparable to that in Tan Teck Soon and Sumanthiran, in that the acts were committed on impulse and were not premeditated. However, the offenders in these cases were young, and did not have any criminal records. While the offender in Tan Keng Huat appeared to have acted with a degree of pre-planning, he had non-violent criminal records. Further, the offenders in all three cases above pleaded guilty which would have been a mitigating factor. Therefore, there was sufficient basis for me to conclude that the term of imprisonment imposed on the accused should be longer than that in those cases.",
      "120": "I was further of the view that a sentence which was in line with the sentences of 18 to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, as was imposed in the following three cases cited by the Prosecution, was warranted.\n(a)     In Dewi Sukowati, the 18-year-old offender was a domestic helper and the deceased was her employer. The deceased splashed water at the offender\u2019s face when the offender had brought her a glass of water, and scolded the offender as well. The offender suddenly grabbed hold of the deceased\u2019s hair and swung her head against the wall. In an attempt to cover up her act, the offender then decided to drown her in the swimming pool. At [20] of its judgment, the Court of Appeal noted that (i) the initial assault occurred because of a loss of control \u2013 the psychiatric evidence showed that the offender was suffering from acute stress reaction, but (ii) the further injuries were inflicted by the offender in an attempt to ensure that the deceased would die so that she would not be able to report the assault; these acts were premeditated and deliberate. The court affirmed the sentence of 18 years\u2019 imprisonment imposed by the High Court.\n(b)     In PP v Nurhayati Criminal Case No 29 of 2012, the offender was a 16-year-old domestic helper who caused the death of her employer\u2019s 12-year-old daughter. She was angry with her employer for reprimanding her frequently and decided to kill the daughter in revenge. She carried the daughter to the 16th floor of the building and pushed her over the parapet. She even concocted a story that the deceased had been kidnapped by two men and claimed to have been raped by them herself. It was found that she had adjustment disorder and depressed mood but these did not affect her ability to form a rational judgment or to exercise willpower to control physical acts. She was sentenced to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.\n(c)     In PP v Vitria Depsi Wahyuni [2013] 1 SLR 699, the offender was a 16-year-old domestic helper who caused the death of her 87-year-old employer. After the employer had reprimanded and insulted the offender, the offender became angry and killed the employer by smothering her with a pillow. She sought to mask her crime by attempting to make it seem that the deceased had died from slipping and falling. The offender was not diagnosed with any mental illness. She was sentenced to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.",
      "121": "The offenders in these three cases were young domestic helpers who had planned the killings of their employers or employers\u2019 family members. The acts were clearly premeditated. The accused\u2019s culpability was lower since his act was not a premeditated one, as I have found. On the other hand, the offenders in the above three cases pleaded guilty, had no criminal records, and either had some mental illness or faced some form of pressure in the course of work. Here, the accused claimed trial (thus showing a lack of remorse) and had a criminal record which included violent crime. Given his deficits in executive functioning that led him to commit the offence, I decided that a sentence on the lower end of the range of 18 to 20 years would be appropriate.",
      "122": "Weighing all the facts and circumstances of the case, and applying the principles of deterrence and retribution, I decided to impose a sentence of 18 years\u2019 imprisonment with effect from 17 December 2013, the date the accused was placed in remand. This stiff sentence was to punish the accused for a heinous crime in which he unnecessarily took away a life, to deter him from committing further offences and to serve as a general signal that such acts are not to be condoned. Given the substantial length of the imprisonment term, I saw no reason to impose a further term of imprisonment in lieu of caning, as pressed for by the Prosecution. I was fortified in this view by the decision of the High Court released after I had imposed the sentence on the accused: Amin bin Abdullah v PP [2017] 5 SLR 904. There, the High Court held that the starting point should be that no enhancement of a sentence in lieu of caning should be ordered unless there are grounds to do so (at [87]).",
      "123": "For the reasons given, I convicted the accused on the charge he faced and imposed the sentence of 18 years\u2019 imprisonment with effect from 17 December 2013."

      "1": "The present appeals arise out of the bloody and brutal killing of Dexmon Chua Yizhi (\u201cthe Deceased\u201d). At some time between the late evening of 28 December 2013 and the early hours of the next day, the Deceased was abducted from the multi-storey car park near his home and forced into a van. He was then severely assaulted, as numerous blunt force blows were inflicted to his head and face, causing extensive fractures in his skull. Almost every bone from the bottom of his eye socket to his lower jaw was fractured. The Deceased was then dumped in the Singapore Armed Forces (\u201cSAF\u201d) live firing area in Lim Chu Kang.",
      "2": "The family of the Deceased reported on 29 December 2013 that he was missing. In connection with this, Chia Kee Chen (\u201cChia\u201d), the appellant in Criminal Appeal No 41 of 2017 (\u201cCCA 41\u201d), was subsequently arrested on 31 December 2013 at the Woodlands immigration checkpoint, as he was returning from a short family holiday in Malaysia. On 1 January 2014, Chia led the police to what by then was the partially-decomposed body of the Deceased.",
      "3": "Chia was tried in the High Court, and the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) convicted him of one count of murder under s 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe PC\u201d) in furtherance of a common intention shared with one Febri Irwansyah Djatmiko (\u201cFebri\u201d), punishable under s 302(2) read with s 34 of the PC. He was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. The Judge\u2019s decision is published as PP v Chia Kee Chen [2017] SGHC 5 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d). Chia appealed against the conviction in CCA 41 while the Prosecution has appealed against the sentence in Criminal Appeal No 40 of 2017 (\u201cCCA 40\u201d), seeking the imposition of the death sentence.",
      "4": "After hearing oral submissions on 9 April 2018, we dismissed Chia\u2019s appeal in CCA 41 and upheld his conviction, for reasons which we will set out below. We reserved judgment in respect of the Prosecution\u2019s appeal in CCA 40, which raises an important question concerning the relevance and weight to be placed on medical evidence pertaining to Chia\u2019s mental state, in determining the appropriate sentence. In brief terms, we consider that in assessing the relevance of such evidence, the key question is whether there is a causal link between the medical condition that has been diagnosed and the factors that go towards the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion in deciding whether to impose the death sentence.",
      "5": "In the present case, the Defence sought to rely on a psychiatric report which opined that Chia suffered from major depressive disorder at the time of the offence in December 2013. In our judgment, this report should be entirely disregarded because it fails to meet even the basic requirements that we expect of an expert report. Experts are duty-bound to be neutral and independent, and to assist the court rather than to advocate for a cause in a partisan manner. This remains the case regardless of how sincerely the expert may sympathise with the cause of his client. In any event, even taking the report as it stands, it would not be material because there is nothing in it that establishes the necessary causal link we have mentioned. We also take the opportunity in this judgment to reiterate the approach that a sentencing court should take when determining whether to impose the death penalty. Applying this approach, we allow the Prosecution\u2019s appeal in CCA 40 and substitute the sentence of life imprisonment with the sentence of death. We now explain our decision.",
      "6": "Chia is a 58-year-old male. He is married to Serene Goh Yen Hoon (\u201cMdm Goh\u201d).",
      "7": "The Deceased was a 37-year-old male at the time of his death. He and Mdm Goh had been colleagues. They had an affair which began in August 2011 and ended sometime in June 2012. Chia found out about their affair sometime in November 2012.",
      "8": "Chia\u2019s accomplice, Febri, is a 36-year-old male Indonesian. Febri was Chia\u2019s long-time friend, having previously operated Chia\u2019s fish farm in Tanjung Pinang, Indonesia. Febri remains at large in Indonesia.",
      "9": "Another involved party is Chua Leong Aik (\u201cChua\u201d), a 68-year-old male. He too was Chia\u2019s long-time friend. At the material time, he resided in an electrical substation beside Block 435, Choa Chu Kang Ave 4, Singapore (\u201cthe substation\u201d). He was arrested in the course of the investigations into the death of the Deceased, and subsequently pleaded guilty to charges of causing grievous hurt and abduction. At the time of Chia\u2019s trial, Chua was serving a five-year imprisonment term.",
      "10": "In the afternoon of 29 December 2013, the Deceased was reported missing by his family members. The police found his car, which had been parked at Deck A3, Lot 290 in the multi-storey car park located at Block 429A, Choa Chu Kang Ave 4, Singapore (\u201cthe car park\u201d). The police found blood on the ground near the car and on its windows as well as above the car.",
      "11": "In connection with this, Chia was subsequently arrested at the Woodlands immigration checkpoint on 31 December 2013 while he was returning from a short family holiday in Malaysia. The next day, he informed the police that he \u201cmay know\u201d where the Deceased\u2019s body was. He then led the police to the SAF live firing area off Lim Chu Kang Road, where they discovered the Deceased\u2019s body.",
      "12": "Chia was charged with one count of murder and one count of abduction, as follows:",
      "13": "At trial, the Prosecution proceeded on the murder charge while the abduction charge was stood down.",
      "14": "The Prosecution\u2019s case was that Chia had meticulously planned the assault on the Deceased intending to murder him. Chia bore a grudge against the Deceased because of his affair with Mdm Goh. There was evidence in the form of police reports lodged by the Deceased that between December 2012 and July 2013, Chia had stalked the Deceased, made threatening phone calls and sent abusive messages to him.",
      "15": "According to the Prosecution, Chia recruited Febri and Chua to assist him in carrying out his plan to murder the Deceased. On Chia\u2019s instructions, Febri came to Singapore from Indonesia on 26 December 2013 and stayed with Chua at the substation. There, on 27 December 2013, the trio allegedly had a detailed discussion about the plan and assigned tasks. In the evening of 28 December 2013, with the assistance of his brother-in-law\u2019s wife, Chua Chiew Hoon, also known as Doreen (\u201cMdm Chua\u201d), Chia borrowed a van (\u201cthe van\u201d) from Ong Soon Yee Vincent (\u201cOng\u201d), who was a friend of Mdm Chua.",
      "16": "On the night of 28 December 2013, Chia met Febri and Chua at the substation. Chia allegedly brought along two knives, something described as an \u201celectrode\u201d, a torchlight and a packet of gloves. Chia then drove Febri and Chua in the van to the car park where the car belonging to the Deceased was later found and parked the van at Lot 291. After some time, the Deceased drove into the car park and parked his car at the adjacent Lot 290. Once the Deceased stepped out of his car, he was confronted by the assailants who assaulted and then pushed him into the cabin of the van where his wrists and ankles were bound with nylon cord to restrain him. Chia and Febri were in the cabin with the Deceased while Chua was directed to drive the van out of the car park towards Lim Chu Kang.",
      "17": "In Chia\u2019s statements to the police given on 10 and 11 January 2014, he said that he and Febri took turns to use a hammer-like object to hit the Deceased. (For the purposes of this judgment, we will refer to this object simply as \u201cthe hammer\u201d.) Chua\u2019s evidence was that before he started driving, he heard \u201cknocking\u201d noises in the cabin of the van and smelt blood. Chua said that near the \u201cLim Chua Kang 19 milestone\u201d, he stopped the van and got out because he was so \u201cfrightened\u201d by what was going on that he could not continue. Chia then took over as the driver. At about 3.00am, Chia called his brother-in-law, Goh Beng Huat (\u201cGoh\u201d), and asked to meet him. They subsequently met at the void deck of the block where Goh\u2019s home was. According to Goh, Chia told him that Mdm Goh (Chia\u2019s wife and Goh\u2019s sister) had been put under a \u201cspell\u201d by someone, and that there had been a fight with that person who had then collapsed. Chia allegedly asked Goh for help to carry the body but Goh declined. (As explained below at [25(h)], Chia disputed that account of his conversation with Goh.)",
      "18": "According to Chia\u2019s statement to the police given on 11 January 2014 (\u201cChia\u2019s 11 January statement\u201d), after the conversation with Goh, he and Febri disposed of the body of the Deceased at the SAF live firing area in Lim Chua Kang. Febri threw the hammer into a canal when they drove past Kranji Road. It was never recovered by the police.",
      "19": "At about 9.00am on 29 December 2013, Chia and Febri washed the van at a fish farm in Lim Chu Kang. Chia then refuelled the van and returned it to Ong at about 2.00pm. Then, at around 3.00pm, Chia, his family and Febri drove to Johor, Malaysia. Febri returned to Indonesia from there.",
      "20": "The Prosecution\u2019s case was that Chia and Febri had assaulted the Deceased with multiple blows of great force aimed at his face and head. The craniofacial blunt force trauma inflicted on the Deceased was, according to the medical evidence given by Assoc Prof Gilbert Lau, sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.",
      "21": "The Prosecution further submitted that the assault was pursuant to Chia\u2019s and Febri\u2019s common intention to commit murder. In this regard, the Prosecution relied in particular on the account of the events in a statement dated 3 February 2014 that Febri had given to the Indonesian police (\u201cFebri\u2019s statement\u201d). Febri said that on 24 December 2013, Chia called him saying that he needed help to \u201ctake revenge on someone in Singapore by killing him because that person had raped his fat wife\u201d. Febri agreed and came to Singapore on 26 December 2013, and on 27 December 2013, Chia \u201cinvited\u201d him to Chua\u2019s substation where the three of them \u201cdiscussed the murder plan and assigned the tasks\u201d. The plan was as follows: when the Deceased arrived at the car park, Chua and Chia would confront him and Chia would pull him into the van through its side door, which Febri would hold open. Chia and Chua would each hold a knife. Chia instructed Febri to use the \u201celectrode\u201d on the Deceased to cause him to lose consciousness, and also taught him how to tie the Deceased up. Febri\u2019s account of the actual abduction was largely in line with this plan. As to subsequent events, we address them in greater detail later but in general, Febri\u2019s account suggested that Chia inflicted most of the injuries, and then the two of them dumped the Deceased\u2019s body at the SAF live firing area and disposed of his belongings at various locations. The Prosecution submitted on this basis, that Chia was the main instigator of the events leading to the death of the Deceased. The Defence challenged the admissibility of Febri\u2019s statement but after an ancillary hearing on the fifth day of trial, the Judge admitted Febri\u2019s statement as corroborative evidence (see [34] below).",
      "22": "The Prosecution also relied on the fact that Chia was the only individual involved in this event who had a personal motive to harm or kill the Deceased. Chia\u2019s hatred for the Deceased could be discerned also from his statements to the police, in which he repeatedly referred to the Deceased as \u201cthat bastard\u201d.",
      "23": "As to sentence, under s 302(2) of the PC, the court has the discretion to impose on a person convicted of murder under s 300(c), the death penalty or a term of life imprisonment (with or without caning). The Prosecution submitted that Chia\u2019s actions exhibited viciousness and a blatant disregard for human life such as would outrage the feelings of the community (see PP v Kho Jabing [2015] 2 SLR 112 (\u201cKho Jabing (2015)\u201d) at [44]\u2013[45]). In particular, the Prosecution emphasised Chia\u2019s role as the mastermind of the entire plan, the significant degree of premeditation and planning involved, the brutality of the attack (as seen from the nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the Deceased and the extensive blood impact spatter found at the car park and in the cabin of the van), the attempts to cover up the crime, and his lack of remorse. In these circumstances, the Prosecution sought the imposition of the death sentence.",
      "24": "It should first be noted that the position of the Defence at trial as to the account of the relevant events differed significantly from the eventual position that was taken at sentencing. Chia\u2019s oral testimony at trial was also inconsistent with the statements he had earlier given to the police. We highlight some of these inconsistencies, where relevant, below.",
      "25": "At trial, Chia maintained that an Indian man named \u201cAli\u201d was involved in the abduction and murder of the Deceased. Chia said that Ali was a part-time security guard working in the Choa Chu Kang area and that he had known Ali for several years though they were not close. Sometime in May or June 2013, Chia met Ali in Johor Bahru, where he told Ali that he had problems retrieving from the Deceased a thumbdrive that contained various video recordings of the sexual activities of Mdm Goh and the Deceased (\u201cthe recordings\u201d). Ali agreed to help Chia if he was paid RM5,000. The rest of Chia\u2019s evidence may be summarised as follows:\n(a)     Febri visited Singapore to buy baby fish, and Chia borrowed the van from Ong in order to help Febri transport the fish to the port.\n(b)     Ali came to the substation on the night of 28 December 2013 in a van driven by an unknown Indian man, and directed Chia to wait at the car park for the Deceased to return. Febri and Chua went along in the van to the car park.\n(c)     At the car park, Ali caught hold of the Deceased\u2019s neck and pushed him into the cabin of the van from the side door. Chia and Febri went into the cabin, but Ali did not. Chia then told Chua to drive them to the Armour Camp at Lim Chu Kang, as Ali had earlier instructed them to meet at the traffic light in that vicinity at 12.30am.\n(d)     While in the back of the van, Chia, Febri and the Deceased kicked at each other. Chia also told the Deceased that he was Mdm Goh\u2019s husband and asked about the recordings.\n(e)     After passing Tengah Air Base, Chua said that he did not want to continue driving and left. Chia then took over as driver. While driving, he heard Febri and the Deceased quarrelling in the cabin and at some point a fight broke out between the two although Chia was unable to say who hit whom.\n(f)     At the meeting point, Ali\u2019s van stopped behind them. Ali then came to the van and told Chia that he wanted to tie the Deceased to a tree. Chia opened the side door of the van and Ali and Febri dragged the Deceased into Ali\u2019s van. Ali drove off and Chia did not see where he went.\n(g)     Chia dropped Febri off at the substation and then drove home. He then left his home again and met Ali at a bus stop near Lot One, a shopping mall in Choa Chu Kang. Chia asked Ali about the recordings and was told he would get it later at around 5.00 or 6.00am. Chia then picked Febri up and dropped Ali off.\n(h)     After dropping Ali off, Chia and Febri drove to Goh\u2019s block, where they spoke about the market price of birds and a bird-singing competition. This was following Chia\u2019s earlier phone call to Goh, which had taken place sometime around 3.00am.\n(i)     At around 5.00am, Chia and Febri drove to the live firing area in Lim Chu Kang to see whether Ali had the recordings, but they did not see Ali there.\n(j)     Chia and Febri then washed the van at the fish farm because the tires were muddy from driving into the live firing area earlier. Febri also washed the interior of the van because it was oily.",
      "26": "The primary submission of the Defence at trial, based on Chia\u2019s oral testimony, was that Chia did not commit murder by causing the death of the Deceased in the van, in furtherance of a common intention shared with Febri. Essentially, Chia sought to pin the blame for the Deceased\u2019s death entirely on Ali. However, since it remains the Defence\u2019s position on appeal (as was its position by the time of sentencing) that Chia\u2019s oral testimony at trial had been almost entirely untrue and that there was in fact no person known as \u201cAli\u201d involved, it is not necessary to set out this submission in any further detail.",
      "27": "For present purposes, it is only necessary to consider the alternative submission of the Defence, which was to the effect that the elements of the charge were not made out because (a) Chia and Febri did not share a common intention to commit murder under s 300(c) of the PC, and (b) it was Febri (and not Chia) who inflicted the fatal injuries on the Deceased after he was abducted at the car park. It is important to note that this alternative submission was premised on Chia\u2019s 11 January statement, and it was mounted on the premise that Chia\u2019s oral testimony was not accepted. As we have already foreshadowed, there were several inconsistencies between Chia\u2019s 11 January statement and Chia\u2019s oral testimony. For instance, in the former, Ali was not involved at all in the abduction of the Deceased at the car park, while he was in the latter (see [25(c)] above). The most significant inconsistency, however, was that in the former, Chia admitted to taking turns with Febri to hit the Deceased on his head with the hammer; while in the latter, Chia said that he did not hit the Deceased with any such object; that he did not see Febri hitting the Deceased with it either; and that the three of them had only kicked at each other (see [25(d)] above).",
      "28": "On the first argument, namely, that Chia and Febri did not share a common intention to commit murder under s 300(c) of the PC, the Defence referred to the portion of Chia\u2019s 11 January statement in which he said that it was Febri who took the hammer, \u201cbecame crazy\u201d and \u201cswung the hammer repeatedly on [the Deceased]\u201d; that Febri then passed the hammer to Chia who used it to hit the Deceased on the forehead once and again with the same on the thigh area; and that Febri then took the hammer back and continued to hit the Deceased on and near his head. The Defence argued that there was no evidence that Chia knew Febri had the hammer when they set off; nor that Chia had instructed Febri to hit the Deceased on his head with the object. The Defence further submitted that it was wholly unexpected that Febri would repeatedly hit the Deceased on his head with the object. Hence, Febri\u2019s assault on the Deceased was not an act in respect of which Chia shared a common intention with Febri. The most that could be said was that Chia did not stop Febri from hitting the Deceased.",
      "29": "On the second argument, namely, that the fatal injuries were inflicted by Febri, the Defence submitted that since the cause of death was identified as craniofacial blunt force trauma, it must have been Febri who inflicted the fatal injuries on the Deceased since he had been responsible for most of the attack after the abduction at the car park.",
      "30": "On the whole, the Defence submitted that the Prosecution failed to prove the elements of the charge beyond reasonable doubt, and therefore Chia could only be convicted on a charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the PC.",
      "31": "As mentioned above at [26], by the time of sentencing, the Defence accepted that Chia\u2019s oral testimony had been almost entirely untrue and that there was no person known as \u201cAli\u201d involved; rather, it was Chia who had engaged Febri and Chua to abduct the Deceased to retrieve the recordings and to teach him a lesson.",
      "32": "The Defence did not dispute the legal principles in Kho Jabing (2015) ([23] supra) relied on by the Prosecution, but emphasised that in Micheal Anak Garing v PP [2017] 1 SLR 748 (\u201cMicheal Anak Garing\u201d) at [54], we had set out two factors relevant to the question of whether an offender had acted in blatant disregard for human life, namely, (a) the offender\u2019s mental state at the time of the attack; and (b) the offender\u2019s actual role or participation in the attack. The Defence submitted that the death penalty should not be imposed on Chia because (a) he was suffering from major depressive disorder at the time of the offence; and (b) there was uncertainty as to the precise roles played by Chia and Febri in the assault on the Deceased:\n(a)     On the first submission, the Defence relied on the psychiatric report of Dr John Bosco Lee dated 21 June 2017 (\u201cthe Lee Report\u201d), which was obtained after conviction (and after Chia engaged new counsel). Dr Lee diagnosed Chia as suffering from major depressive disorder in 2013, and identified one of the stressors that triggered Chia\u2019s mental condition as his obsession with the recordings and his belief that he had received \u201caffirmation\u201d from various mediums and gods that the Deceased had used those recordings to practise black magic or cast a spell on Mdm Goh. Dr Lee also concluded that Chia\u2019s mental condition had \u201caffected his perceptions, his emotional responses [and] his behavio[u]ral responses\u201d, and \u201ccontributed much to his disturbed mental state around the time of the offence\u201d [emphasis in original omitted].\n(b)     On the second submission, the Defence argued that because the accounts provided by Chia, Febri and Chua diverged in many respects, there was a patent lack of clarity as to each individual\u2019s specific role in the assault. (A summary of Chua\u2019s evidence may be found at [51] below.) It was thus unsafe to impose the death penalty on Chia.",
      "33": "On 17 January 2017, the Judge convicted Chia of murder under s 300(c) of the PC. Subsequently, on 4 August 2017, the Judge sentenced Chia to a term of life imprisonment. We summarise the Judge\u2019s decision on the admissibility of Febri\u2019s statement and on conviction and sentence.",
      "34": "As mentioned at [21] above, the Defence challenged the admissibility of Febri\u2019s statement. Febri never returned to Singapore and he could not be arrested, prosecuted or compelled to give evidence. However, with the co-operation of the Indonesian police, Febri\u2019s statement was recorded by Police Brigadier Jhon Frenky Damanik, at the Bintan police station. Inspector Cyndi Koh Yu Shan and Senior Station Inspector (2) Mazlan bin Shariff (\u201cSSI(2)\u201d), both of the Singapore Police Force, were present when Febri\u2019s statement was recorded. At trial, the Prosecution sought to admit Febri\u2019s statement under s 32(1)(j)(iii) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe EA\u201d) on the ground that Febri was outside Singapore and that it was not practicable to secure his attendance.",
      "35": "After an ancillary hearing, the Judge admitted Febri\u2019s statement on the fifth day of trial. The Judge subsequently gave his reasons at [10] of the Judgment, as follows:\n(a)     Febri was an accomplice and would have been subject to prosecution. It was therefore not surprising that he refused to testify in Singapore.\n(b)     The recording officer, Brigadier Damanik, had checked with Febri who affirmed that he was well and fit to have his statement recorded. Insp Koh, who was also present at the recording, testified that Febri looked well.\n(c)     Febri\u2019s statement was recorded in one session which did not seem unreasonably long.\n(d)     The Judge admitted Febri\u2019s statement not as \u201cprimary evidence against Chia, but as a further piece of corroborative evidence\u201d. The Judge observed that although Febri did not know the proper names of the various people involved, his narrative was consistent in material respects with Chia\u2019s and Chua\u2019s evidence. Febri\u2019s statement referred to Chia as \u201cACIA\u201d, Chua as \u201cWATER\u201d, Mdm Chua as the \u201cfat wife\u201d and Mdm Goh as the \u201cthin wife\u201d. Febri also identified the persons he described when their photographs were shown to him. The Judge thus concluded that the probative value of Febri\u2019s statement warranted its admission into evidence.",
      "36": "Additionally, in the context of his reasons for convicting Chia, the Judge acknowledged that neither Febri nor Chua gave a \u201cfully consistent\u201d statement. However, the Judge noted that they had not contradicted themselves in the way that Chia had (at [18] of the Judgment).",
      "37": "Chia was the only witness for the Defence, and the Judge found that he was \u201can unreliable witness\u201d because he had \u201ccontradicted himself many times over\u201d, or his evidence was \u201ccontradicted by the evidence of other witnesses\u201d, or he had simply \u201cgiven incredible accounts\u201d (at [18] of the Judgment). For instance:\n(a)     Chia in cross-examination denied leading the police to the canal in Kranji into which Febri had thrown the hammer. This was odd because Chia had drawn the object in his 10 January 2014 statement, and there was \u201cincontrovertible evidence\u201d of the police having searched the area although the object was ultimately not recovered (at [16] of the Judgment).\n(b)     In Chia\u2019s cautioned statements dated 1 January 2014 and 11 November 2014, he denied being at the car park and also his involvement in the abduction and murder. This was contradicted by the evidence of other witnesses. It was also contrary to the position eventually taken in the closing submissions of the Defence, where it was admitted that Chia, together with Febri and Chua, abducted the Deceased from the car park (at [17] of the Judgment).\n(c)     Chia\u2019s account that he had called Goh at 3.00am on 29 December 2013 to ask about the market price of birds could not be believed. There was \u201cincontrovertible evidence that he had just spent the earlier part of the morning in the van with Chua, Febri, and [the Deceased]\u201d such that \u201c[a]ny thought of buying birds at that time [was] surely a flight of fancy\u201d (at [18] of the Judgment).\n(d)     Chia claimed that \u201cAli\u201d and an unnamed Indian man were involved in the abduction and murder, but there was absolutely no evidence of the existence of these persons (at [18] of the Judgment).",
      "38": "The Judge found as follows (at [19] of the Judgment):\n(a)     Chia \u201calone had the motive and intention to kill or cause grievous hurt to [the Deceased]\u201d. On 27 December 2013, he finalised his plans. On the evening of 28 December 2013, he gathered Febri and Chua to assist him. Chua drove the van. The three of them waited in the car park for the Deceased to arrive. When the Deceased arrived, they \u201caccosted him and bundled him into the van\u201d where he was assaulted by Chia and/or Febri.\n(b)     The assault was so severe that the Deceased suffered injuries sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and the Deceased indeed died from these injuries.\n(c)     There was no need to prove whether a hammer was used in the assault, or whether the hammer, if used, had been found. There was some evidence that a hammer was used. There was also some evidence that the head of the Deceased had been smashed against the van. Either way, the injuries that led to his death \u201cwere intentional\u201d. The evidence of the injuries showed \u201crepeated blows\u201d, which excluded the possibility of these being accidental in nature.\n(d)     Both Chia and Febri had the common intention to assault the Deceased as they did:\n(i)       It \u201cdid not matter who dealt the crucial blow\u201d although it seemed to the Judge that it was likely to be Chia, he being the one \u201cwith the motive and the hatred for [the Deceased]\u201d.\n(ii)       Since the limbs of the Deceased were tied using a form of knot that had to be constantly held to maintain fastness, either Chia or Febri held down the Deceased while the other hit him. Their common intention was to inflict the physical harm that was in fact inflicted. There was no evidence that \u201ceither had not intended that\u201d; neither was there \u201cevidence that either of them had a change of mind during the assault\u201d. Both would have been guilty of causing those injuries that were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.",
      "39": "Accordingly, the Judge convicted Chia of murder under s 300(c) of the PC punishable under s 302(2) read with s 34 of the PC (at [20] of the Judgment).",
      "40": "In his brief oral grounds delivered on 4 August 2017, the Judge reasoned that although Chia \u201cmay have had the motive and probably the intention to kill\u201d, the charge against him was brought under s 300(c) and not s 300(a) of the PC. He also noted that it was possible that \u201cit was one of the other accomplices [namely, Febri] who had inflicted the fatal blows\u201d. Accordingly, he sentenced Chia to a term of life imprisonment, with effect from 1 January 2014 (the date of first remand).",
      "41": "As mentioned, Chia appealed against his conviction in CCA 41 while the Prosecution appealed against the sentence in CCA 40. We will deal with each appeal in turn, beginning with CCA 41.",
      "42": "The Defence raised several grounds of appeal in its Petition of Appeal, which may be summarised as follows:\n(a)     The Judge erred in admitting Febri\u2019s statement into evidence and/or in placing undue weight on Febri\u2019s statement.\n(b)     The Judge erred in making the following findings at [19] and [20] of the Judgment:\n(i)       that Chia alone had the motive and intention to kill or cause grievous hurt to the Deceased;\n(ii)       that Chia and Febri had the common intention to assault the Deceased as they did;\n(iii)       that it \u201cdid not matter who dealt the crucial blow\u201d although it seemed that it was probably Chia who did;\n(iv)       that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that either Chia or Febri had not intended the harm that was in fact inflicted on the Deceased; and\n(v)       that \u201c[w]hen the common evidence and the incontrovertible forensic evidence are examined, there can be only one conclusion\u201d.",
      "43": "As subsequently became clear from the written and oral submissions of the Defence, the crux of the case for the Defence was that Chia and Febri did not share a common intention. According to the Defence, Chia only had the intention to abduct the Deceased and cause hurt, or at most, grievous hurt. On the other hand, Febri (alone) had the intention to inflict the fatal craniofacial injuries. The Defence argued that the Deceased was still alive when Chua left the van and Chia took over as driver. Accordingly, there was a possibility that Febri had single-handedly inflicted the fatal craniofacial injuries on the Deceased when the two of them were in the cabin of the van. The Defence submitted that it was not part of Chia\u2019s plan for Febri to have assaulted the Deceased in the way that he did. In other words, in inflicting the fatal craniofacial injuries, Febri went beyond the scope of their common intention.",
      "44": "The Prosecution submitted that the Judge correctly admitted Febri\u2019s statement as a piece of corroborative evidence. Further, the Prosecution submitted that the Judge correctly concluded that Chia alone had the motive and intention to kill the Deceased, and had recruited Febri and Chua to help him do so. The trio accosted the Deceased, and then Chia and Febri \u2013 in furtherance of their common intention \u2013 assaulted the Deceased to death in the cabin of the van by hitting him repeatedly in the head and face.",
      "45": "The applicable legal principles were not in dispute. The four elements of a charge under s 300(c) of the PC are set out in our decision in Kho Jabing v PP [2011] 3 SLR 634 (\u201cKho Jabing\u201d) at [22], citing Virsa Singh v State of Punjab AIR 1958 SC 465 at [12]:\n(a)     a bodily injury must be present and objectively proved;\n(b)     the nature of the injury must be objectively proved;\n(c)     it must be established that the bodily injury in question had been intentionally inflicted; and\n(d)     the bodily injury in question must be sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.",
      "46": "Further, in Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan v PP [2010] 4 SLR 1119 (\u201cDaniel Vijay\u201d), we held that to establish joint liability under s 34 of the PC for s 300(c) murder, it had to be shown that there was a common intention to cause, specifically, a type of injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and not any other type of injury (at [145]\u2013[147] and [167]) (see [88] below). As \u201cit is often difficult, if not impossible, for the Prosecution to procure direct evidence that a common intention existed between all the offenders\u201d, the existence of such common intention may, and frequently must, be \u201cinferred from the offenders\u2019 conduct and all the other relevant circumstances of the case\u201d (Daniel Vijay at [97]).",
      "47": "The central issue in this case was whether it had been shown on the evidence that Chia and Febri shared a common intention to inflict the craniofacial injuries on the Deceased, which were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Having considered the evidence, we were satisfied that this had been shown to be the case beyond any reasonable doubt. We therefore upheld the conviction and dismissed CCA 41.",
      "48": "Before explaining our decision, we first deal with two preliminary points regarding the evidence before this court.",
      "49": "The first point concerns the application by the Defence, made in Criminal Motion No 7 of 2018, for leave to admit three further pieces of evidence on appeal, namely:\n(a)     the statement of facts dated 5 January 2016, which Chua admitted to without qualification when he pleaded guilty to the charges against him (\u201cChua\u2019s SOF\u201d);\n(b)     Chua\u2019s cautioned statement dated 9 January 2014; and\n(c)     Chua\u2019s cautioned statement dated 11 November 2014.",
      "50": "Even though this evidence was technically available at the time of trial, this is less important in applications to adduce further evidence made by an accused person (see this court\u2019s recent decision in PP v Mohd Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan [2018] 1 SLR 544 at [56]\u2013[61] and Soh Meiyun v PP [2014] 3 SLR 299 at [16]). Given the possible relevance and evident reliability of this evidence, we granted the application to adduce this further evidence during the hearing on 9 April 2018 and the oral arguments proceeded on this basis.",
      "51": "Chua\u2019s evidence (including his oral testimony at trial) may be summarised as follows:\n(a)     Events leading up to the offence: Chia recruited Febri and Chua to assist in his \u201cplan to attack the Deceased\u201d. On the night of 28 December 2013, Chia told Chua that he wanted to \u201cteach [the Deceased] a lesson\u201d; Chua understood this to mean that Chia needed his help to \u201cbeat up the Deceased severely\u201d.\n(b)     The abduction from the car park: After the Deceased parked his car and alighted, Chia alighted from the van \u201cholding his fist and rushed towards the [Deceased]\u201d. Chua saw that Chia and the Deceased were \u201cmoving in and out beside the van where [he] was seated\u201d but he could not tell whether they were fighting or pushing each other. He heard the Deceased \u201cshouting for help\u201d, and then the Deceased was \u201cdropped\u201d into the cabin of the van. Although Chua could not see what was happening in the cabin of the van, he heard \u201cknocking\u201d noises and smelt blood when Chia handed him the keys to the van.\n(c)     What happened in the van while Chua was driving: He heard \u201ccontinued sounds of the Deceased being beaten, and of the Deceased moaning in pain\u201d as well panting noises. He also smelt blood in the van.\n(d)     What happened when Chua left the van: As a result of hearing the sounds of the Deceased being beaten and smelling blood, Chua \u201ccould not take it anymore and wanted to alight from the van\u201d. Chua told Chia that he \u201cwas too frightened to drive further\u201d and exited the van. As Chua left the van, he heard \u201ca sound of heavy breathing\u201d and \u201csaw that the Deceased\u2019s legs were still moving slightly\u201d. Chia then took over as driver of the van, while Chua returned to the substation by bus.",
      "52": "The second point concerns the submission by the Defence that the Judge erred in admitting Febri\u2019s statement and/or that he had placed undue weight upon it. The Defence made three main arguments in support of its case that Febri\u2019s statement was inadmissible. We rejected these arguments for the reasons that follow.",
      "53": "First, the Defence argued that Febri\u2019s statement was essentially the evidence of an accomplice, and that pursuant to illustration (b) to s 116 of the EA, the court is entitled to presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and that his evidence needs to be treated with caution. We had no difficulty in rejecting this argument because the provision in question serves to caution the court as to the weight to be accorded to such evidence, rather than to preclude its admission altogether.",
      "54": "Second, the Defence submitted that the Prosecution had not established the requirements under s 32(1)(j)(iii) of the EA \u2013 specifically, the requirement that it was \u201cnot practicable\u201d to secure the statement-maker\u2019s attendance. The Defence argued that aside from evidence that the police had asked Febri to come to Singapore to testify as a witness and that he had declined, there was no evidence that the Prosecution had taken any other efforts to secure Febri\u2019s attendance. In our judgment, this failed to appreciate the reality of the situation. Febri was not a compellable witness. There was simply no reason to think that he would voluntarily come to Singapore where he was wanted as an accomplice in the abduction and murder of the Deceased and would almost certainly be prosecuted for this. These points were similarly noted by the Judge at [9]\u2013[10] of the Judgment. In these circumstances, the court was entirely justified in drawing the inference that it was not practicable to secure Febri\u2019s attendance in Singapore, even without the Prosecution having adduced evidence as to any other efforts that it had undertaken.",
      "55": "In passing, we note that even if the requirements under s 32(1)(j)(iii) were not satisfied, the requirements under s 32(1)(j)(iv) of the EA would have been satisfied, in that Febri was competent but not compellable to give evidence and refused to do so.",
      "56": "Finally, the Defence argued that even if the technical requirements of s 32(1)(j)(iii) were satisfied, Febri\u2019s statement ought to be excluded \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d pursuant to s 32(3) of the EA. In support of this contention, the Defence relied on (a) the fact that Febri\u2019s statement was essentially the evidence of an accomplice; and additionally highlighted that (b) Febri\u2019s statement had been recorded in a foreign jurisdiction, by a foreign police recorder and in a foreign language. We have already noted that the fact that the relevant evidence was given by an accomplice is not, in and of itself, a reason to render it inadmissible. We were also not moved by the second point. As stated above at [34], police officers from the Singapore Police Force, Insp Koh and SSI(2) Mazlan, were present at the Bintan police station when Brigadier Damanik recorded Febri\u2019s statement. SSI(2) Mazlan understood and spoke Bahasa Indonesia. There was also no issue raised as to the accuracy of the translation. Accordingly, there was nothing to justify excluding Febri\u2019s evidence entirely.",
      "57": "Having said that, we did agree with the Defence that little or no weight should be placed on Febri\u2019s statement. We emphasise that Febri\u2019s statement contained a confession of his own involvement as an accomplice to a very serious crime. In such circumstances, there would be a real prospect of Febri making self-serving statements that minimised his role and culpability while maximising that of others. It was inherently risky for the court to place weight on such evidence. This risk is amplified when, as was the case here, the accomplice is not available for cross-examination and hence his statement is untested. With this in mind, we turn to consider Febri\u2019s statement.",
      "58": "There were two particular aspects of the account of events narrated there which, in our view, were problematic. The first concerned Febri\u2019s account of who assaulted the Deceased:",
      "59": "This seemed somewhat contrived in that it painted a picture where Febri did nothing other than to check for the pulse of the Deceased after Chia had assaulted him, and this to ascertain that the Deceased was dead. Unsurprisingly, this account was directly contradicted by Chia\u2019s 11 January statement, in which he stated that it was Febri who had used the hammer to repeatedly hit the Deceased on the head. We also note that Febri\u2019s narration was not consistent with Chua\u2019s evidence which suggested that the Deceased was still alive when Chua left the van (see [51(d)] above).",
      "60": "The second aspect concerned Febri\u2019s account of what happened when Chua left the van:",
      "61": "This account was entirely contradicted by the evidence of both Chia and Chua, who maintained that Chua alone had returned to the substation, while Febri remained with Chia.",
      "62": "There were other examples illustrating the self-serving nature of Febri\u2019s account but it is not necessary for us to rehearse them here. In our judgment, Febri\u2019s statement, taken as a whole, sought to portray Chia as the primary offender who inflicted most, if not all, of the injuries on the Deceased that led to his demise, while simultaneously minimising Febri\u2019s own role. On Febri\u2019s narration of the facts, he was a largely passive participant who merely held the door of the van open while Chia and Chua confronted the Deceased and initially assaulted him; applied the \u201celectrode\u201d to render the Deceased unconscious; bound the Deceased\u2019s ankles with the pre-prepared nylon cords in the van; and then Febri did not lay a finger on the Deceased except to check for his pulse and confirm his death, after Chia had assaulted him. Further, it seemed clear to us that Febri\u2019s account that he had left the van together with Chua was a self-serving fabrication inconsistent with the account of both Chia and Chua. Taken together, this undermined the reliability of Febri\u2019s statement and we therefore agreed with the Defence that little or no weight should be placed on Febri\u2019s statement.",
      "63": "However, even without taking Febri\u2019s statement into account, we were satisfied that the remaining evidence, including in particular Chia\u2019s various statements to the police, was sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Chia and Febri shared a common intention to inflict the craniofacial injuries that killed the Deceased. For this purpose, it would be useful to examine the events as they unfolded under the following headings: (a) Chia\u2019s motive; (b) the abduction from the car park; (c) what happened in the van while Chua was driving; and (d) what happened in the van after Chua left.",
      "64": "We begin by considering Chia\u2019s motive. As to this, the Defence accepted that Chia intended to abduct the Deceased and cause hurt, or at most, grievous hurt (see [43] above). In oral submissions, the Defence argued that there were two operative concerns behind this: first, Chia wanted to teach the Deceased a lesson; and second, Chia wanted to retrieve the recordings of the sexual activities of the Deceased and Mdm Goh.",
      "65": "In our judgment, the evidence clearly showed that Chia\u2019s operative motive was to exact his revenge on the Deceased rather than to retrieve the recordings. First, it was plain that Chia bore a grudge against the Deceased over his affair with Mdm Goh (which lasted nearly a year from August 2011 to June 2012) and which Chia found out about sometime in November 2012 (see [7] above). The evidence strongly suggested that Chia made threatening phone calls, sent abusive messages to and stalked the Deceased at various times between December 2012 and July 2013 (see [14] above). As the Prosecution submitted, the depth of Chia\u2019s enmity was also evident from the language used in his various statements.",
      "66": "Second, Chua\u2019s SOF \u2013 which the Defence itself relied on \u2013 contained several references to the plan \u201cto attack the Deceased\u201d. Chua\u2019s SOF also recounted a conversation that occurred on the night of 28 December 2013, as follows:",
      "67": "Third, Chia\u2019s own evidence was that he wanted to \u201ctorture\u201d the Deceased and to make him \u201csuffer so much\u201d. The material portion of Chia\u2019s 11 January statement read as follows:",
      "68": "The overall picture that emerged from this evidence was clear: Chia wanted to teach the Deceased a lesson, and had come up with a plan to achieve this, which entailed beating the Deceased up severely and causing him as much suffering as possible. Chia recruited Febri and Chua to assist him because he knew that the Deceased \u201cwas very big size[d]\u201d and that he \u201ccould not beat [the Deceased] alone\u201d. He borrowed a van \u201cfor capturing [the Deceased]\u201d. Chia also procured two knives and other paraphernalia and brought them along to be used, if needed, to subdue and restrain the Deceased. While the Defence, in its oral submissions, emphasised that there was no evidence that the knives had been used, this missed the point. The mere fact that Chia had procured these knives and brought them along was itself relevant to the determination of just what Chia\u2019s intentions were.",
      "69": "On the other hand, the evidence supporting the contention that Chia\u2019s operative motive was to retrieve the recordings was scant. In Chia\u2019s 11 January statement, he claimed that he wanted to retrieve the recordings and asked the Deceased about them while they were in the cabin of the van:",
      "70": "Aside from these assertions, there was no evidence at all that Chia had focused on or made any genuine attempt to retrieve the recordings from the Deceased after his abduction from the car park. Rather, the objective evidence was to the effect that the Deceased was brutally assaulted while he was in the cabin of the van, in keeping with Chia\u2019s desire to exact revenge. In Chia\u2019s own words, he \u201cwas angry and did not stop [Febri] from hitting [the Deceased] with the hammer\u201d (see [67] above). In this connection, it was notable that when Chia was asked about how he felt when he discovered that the Deceased was dead, Chia did not express regret that he had failed to retrieve the recordings. Rather, Chia said that he thought the Deceased had died \u201ctoo fast\u201d, before Chia could \u201cdo much\u201d, meaning before he could cause the Deceased even more suffering (see [65] above).",
      "71": "We turn to the evidence relating to the abduction of the Deceased from the car park. According to the report from the Health Sciences Authority dated 7 April 2015 (\u201cthe HSA Report\u201d):\n(a)     Blood spatter and stains were found over the exterior of the car belonging to the Deceased parked at Lot 290. Blood spatter was also found on the rear wall, path, floor and ceiling of the car park. This was all established to be the blood of the Deceased. The bloodstains on the ceiling were approximately above the point between the driver\u2019s door and the right rear door of the car. The distribution of blood stains indicated that an assault on the Deceased had taken place in close proximity to his car.\n(b)     There were also cast-off patterns on the right rear window of the Deceased\u2019s car caused by an item wet with blood moving vertically upward. Blood was spattered in a downward direction on the right rear wheel assembly. There appeared to be swipe blood patterns on the bodywork below the right rear window and on the right rear door.\n(c)     The reconstruction of events provided in the HSA Report suggested that the Deceased had been assaulted by \u201ca blunt object\u201d (which could include a closed fist) while he was positioned between his car and the van. Once blood started to flow, the Deceased was hit with sufficient force to break up the flowing blood into small droplets. These were deposited on the window of the driver\u2019s door of the car when the bloodied surface (probably the Deceased\u2019s head) was near the rear edge of the driver\u2019s door, approximately in line with the door handle.",
      "72": "From this evidence, it was clear that a violent assault on the Deceased had taken place at the point of abduction. On this basis alone, the evidence in Chia\u2019s 11 January statement that \u201c[n]o one assaulted [the Deceased] before [Chia] pushed him into the rear of the van\u201d must be rejected. Further, this aspect of Chia\u2019s evidence was entirely contradicted by Chua\u2019s testimony at trial. Chua testified that after the Deceased had parked his car, Chia and Febri exited the van. Chia was \u201cholding his fist and rushed towards the [Deceased]\u201d. Chua also said that Chia and the Deceased were \u201cmoving in and out beside the van where [he] was seated\u201d but he could not tell whether they were \u201cfighting or pushing\u201d each other. He heard the Deceased shouting for help twice. Chua also mentioned that when Chia handed him the van key and told him to drive, he smelt blood. This suggested that there was blood on Chia\u2019s clothes and/or body by that time, which was entirely consistent with the blood found on the car and in the various locations around and above the car. We accordingly had no doubt that Chia had violently assaulted the Deceased at the time of the abduction.",
      "73": "We turn to consider what happened in the van while Chua was driving. Again, it was clear from the objective forensic evidence that the violent assault on the Deceased continued in the cabin of the van. Blood spatter found in the van was established to be the blood of the Deceased. There was impact spatter on the ceiling, rear door and both side walls of the cabin of the van. The police recovered one half of the wooden floorboard that was originally in the van\u2019s cabin (but had been disposed of at the fish farm in Lim Chu Kang) and forensic analysis showed that the floorboard was stained with blood.",
      "74": "The Defence did not dispute that an assault on the Deceased had taken place while Chia and Febri were both in the cabin with him. The Defence instead maintained that it was Febri who had inflicted most of the blows with the hammer, and that Chia had only hit the Deceased once on the forehead and on the thigh area. In support of this, the Defence referred to the following portion of Chia\u2019s 11 January statement:",
      "75": "This portion of Chia\u2019s statement was critical and merits careful consideration. Before doing so, it is useful to bear in mind how Chia, Febri and the Deceased were positioned relative to each other in the cabin of the van. According to a sketch provided in Chia\u2019s 11 January statement, the Deceased lay diagonally across the floor of the van, with his feet behind the driver\u2019s seat and his head towards the left rear wheel. Chia was behind the passenger\u2019s seat, while Febri sat diagonally across the Deceased\u2019s body, near the right rear wheel of the van.",
      "76": "In our judgment, far from supporting the case of the Defence, the portion of Chia\u2019s statement that we have quoted above supports the finding that Chia and Febri shared a common intention to inflict the fatal craniofacial injuries on the Deceased in at least four ways, even accepting Chia\u2019s narrative in its entirety.",
      "77": "First, Chia actively assistedin Febri\u2019s initial assault on the Deceased. According to Chia\u2019s statement, it was Febri who initiated the assault by using the hammer to strike the Deceased\u2019s head. This caused the Deceased to struggle. Chia was restraining the Deceased\u2019s legs at this point in time. Instead of telling Febri to stop hitting the Deceased, Chia continued to restrain the Deceased\u2019s legs, and even threatened to saw off the Deceased\u2019s legs if he continued to struggle.",
      "78": "Second, Chia continued to actively assisteven when he saw that Febri\u2019s assault had become more frenzied and ferocious than before. Chia described Febri as having gone \u201ccrazy\u201d and swinging the hammer at the Deceased\u2019s head repeatedly. Yet, Chia continued to help restrain the Deceased\u2019s legs throughout this assault. This was evident from his statement that he had to first \u201creleased [his] grips [sic]\u201d on the Deceased\u2019s legs in order to accept the hammer when Febri handed it to him. There was no indication that Chia did anything to stop the assault. In fact, it was clear that Chia had no intention to do so. As Chia said in his 11 January statement, because the Deceased had ignored Chia\u2019s questions about the recordings, \u201c[he] was angry and did not stop [Febri] from hitting [the Deceased] with the hammer\u201d (see [67] above).",
      "79": "Third, Chia personally joined in the assaulton the Deceased evenafterhe saw that Febri had gone \u201ccrazy\u201d and hit the Deceased on his head repeatedly. He told Febri to pass him the hammer, and then used it to hit the Deceased on the forehead once and then on the thigh area. Clearly, at this juncture, Chia\u2019s conduct went beyond mere complicity in the assault or being only an assistant \u2013 he personally participated, without instigation and of his own accord, in the assault against the Deceased. The Defence submitted that Chia\u2019s conduct should be characterised as a failure to prevent Febri from assaulting the Deceased, and that this did not amount to his sharing a common intention with Febri to inflict the particular s 300(c) injuries (namely, the craniofacial injuries). Plainly, this submission could not stand given that Chia joined Febri, first in restraining the Deceased while Febri assaulted him, and then in personally assaulting the Deceased. The only possible conclusion was that they shared a common intention to inflict those injuries.",
      "80": "It was also significant that Chia struck the Deceased on the forehead given that Chia identified the \u201chead area\u201d as the place that Febri\u2019s earlier frenzied assault was targeted at. (On this note, a suggestion was made at the hearing of the appeals, which we rejected, to the effect that perhaps Chia did not know or was not able to see exactly where Febri was hitting the Deceased. It will be recalled that according to Chia, Febri was positioned diagonally opposite him, with the body of the Deceased between them (see [73] above). We therefore rejected any suggestion that Chia\u2019s view of what Febri was doing to the Deceased had been obstructed in any material way. Further, Febri had repeatedly struck the Deceased. It was impossible that Chia could have failed to observe where Febri had struck the Deceased, throughout the entire duration of the assault.)",
      "81": "Before leaving this point, we also note what Chia said in his 11 January statement about his feelings while hitting the Deceased:",
      "82": "This put beyond doubt that Chia had intended to inflict the particular injuries that he did on the Deceased and it went even further in setting out exactly what he sought to achieve, despite his anxiety that he might actually succeed in killing him.",
      "83": "Finally, Chia enabled Febri to continue the assaulton the Deceased. By this juncture, Chia had seen that Febri could go \u201ccrazy\u201d and hit the Deceased on his head repeatedly. Yet, Chia allowed Febri to take the hammer back and to continue to hit the head of the Deceased. The only inference that could be drawn from this was that Chia wanted and intended for Febri to inflict those injuries on the Deceased.",
      "84": "Finally, we turn to consider what happened in the van after Chua left and Chia took over as driver of the van. As mentioned at [43] above, the crux of the case for the Defence was that the Deceased was still alive when Chua left the van and Chia took over as driver, and there was thus a possibility that Febri had single-handedly continued the assault and inflicted the fatal craniofacial injuries on the Deceased then. We rejected this possibility for several reasons.",
      "85": "First, the only evidence that the Defence could point to in support of its case was the statement in Chua\u2019s SOF that when he left the van and Chia took over as the driver, Chua \u201csaw that the Deceased\u2019s legs were still moving slightly\u201d. In our judgment, this did not take the case for the Defence very far. The slight movement of the Deceased\u2019s legs was likely the throes of a dying man, having regard to the violent assault which, as outlined above, had already transpired. In this regard, it is relevant to note that in Chua\u2019s SOF, it was stated that having \u201cheard continued sounds of the Deceased being beaten, and of the Deceased moaning in pain\u201d and \u201csmelt the scent of blood in the van\u201d, he \u201ccould not take it anymore and wanted to alight from the van\u201d. Chua, in short, was sickened by the sounds and smells that emanated from the cabin of the van. This could only have been the result of a violent and bloody assault on the Deceased. Further, it should be noted that from the extracts of Chia\u2019s 11 January statement that we have reproduced at [72] above, Chia maintained that Febri had repeatedly assaulted the Deceased in the region of his head while they were both in the cabin of the van, before Chua left. Finally, at the hearing before us, the Defence had to and did concede that there was no evidence in any of the statements or in any testimony of any witness that a continuing violent assault upon the Deceased had taken place after Chua left the van. Hence this argument was ultimately without any evidentiary basis.",
      "86": "Second, the hypothesis that the material part of the assault had only taken place after Chia took over as the driver of the van was inconsistent with the objective forensic evidence. According to the HSA Report, there was an area of reddish-brown staining on the driver\u2019s rubber floor mat, which had the appearance of having been caused by liquid blood (which was analysed and found to belong to the Deceased). When the van was sprayed with Luminol reagent (which reacts with blood), the areas which reacted positively included the interior of the driver\u2019s door (on the arm rest and the surrounding area of the door pocket), the floor mat, the area of the ignition switch and parts of the steering wheel. It was thus apparent that at some point, the driver of the van had transferred blood to these areas. The forensic evidence therefore showed that by the time Chia took over as driver, there had already been a very violent assault on the Deceased and that consequently, Chia\u2019s hands and shoes were covered with blood which was then transferred to the driver\u2019s seat and the surrounding areas. There was simply no other possibility because the only other person who drove the van that night was Chua and there was no evidence from anyone, including Chia, to suggest that Chua was ever in a position to transfer blood to the area of and around the driver\u2019s seat.",
      "87": "Consistent with Chua\u2019s evidence and the HSA Report, Chia\u2019s own evidence in his 11 January statement was that when he took over as driver, the van \u201csmel[t] strongly of blood\u201d and that he needed to wind down the window. The unmistakeable picture that emerged from all the evidence was that a very violent and bloody assault had occurred before Chua left the van. In fact, as noted above at [82], this was the very reason Chua left the van, at which point, Chia took over as the driver. We therefore had no hesitation rejecting the unsubstantiated assertion that Febri might have single-handedly inflicted the fatal craniofacial injuries on the Deceased while he was alone in the cabin of the van with the Deceased.",
      "88": "We digress to address a related point of importance. It seemed to us that the submission of the Defence that Febri had inflicted the fatal craniofacial injuries (as well as the submission that Febri had struck the majority of the blows using the hammer \u2013 see [72] above) proceeded on the misguided premise that Chia would be acquitted of the murder charge if a reasonable doubt could be raised that it was Febri who inflicted the particular fatal injuries on the Deceased. We take the opportunity to clarify the concept of the \u201cmortal blow\u201d, and the necessity of attributing such a blow to a particular offender.",
      "89": "It is sometimes easy to identify the mortal blow \u2013 for instance, if there is only a single stab wound to the victim\u2019s heart. On the other hand, there are scenarios where death could ensue from an accumulation of blows. Consider the victim of multiple stab wounds who bleeds to death. Since the cause of death is effectively exsanguination, it may not be possible to identify with any certainty the particular stab wound that was the \u201cmortal blow\u201d; in this situation, the concept of the mortal blow simply may not square with the scientific reality. Quite aside from the issue of whether it is possible to identify the mortal blow, there is the question of whether the identification of the mortal blow is even a material inquiry in the first place. For instance, if there is only one assailant who inflicts each of the several injuries that then result in death, it would obviously not be necessary to identify the particular mortal blow since on any analysis, that assailant must be responsible for the victim\u2019s death. For these reasons, and at the risk of stating the obvious, we wish to clarify that it is not necessary in every case to identify the mortal blow. Likewise, it is not necessary in every case to attribute the mortal blow to a particular offender. Neither of these are necessary ingredients for the purposes of establishing a conviction for murder under s 300 read with s 34 of the PC (see Daniel Vijay ([46] supra)at [168(a)]\u2013[168(b)] and Ong Chee Hoe v PP [1999] 3 SLR(R) 273 at [47]).",
      "90": "The present case was one where the Deceased died from an accumulation of blows inflicted by multiple assailants. It will be recalled that the evidence of Assoc Prof Gilbert Lau was that the cause of death was craniofacial blunt force trauma (see [20] above), but this was in the context of the accumulation of these injuries rather than any particular injuries or blows. This was therefore a case where it was not possible to identify the mortal blow, let alone attribute it to either Chia or Febri. But, as long as we were satisfied that the assailants shared a common intention to inflict the injuries in question, the impossibility of identifying of the mortal blow or of attributing it to a particular assailant would be irrelevant.",
      "91": "Further, even if it were possible to identify and attribute the mortal blow to a particular offender (namely, the \u201cprimary offender\u201d or the \u201cactual doer\u201d), one does not necessarily escape liability for murder under s 300(c) read with s 34 of the PC simply by disclaiming the mortal blow. Section 34 of the PC imposes constructive liability. By definition, this means that a person (namely, the secondary offender) may be held liable for an offence that arises from an act that he did not personally carry out as long as it can be established that it was done in furtherance of the offenders\u2019 common intention to commit the very criminal act done by the actual doer (see Daniel Vijay at [97] and [166]). In the context of murder under s 300(c), the key question is whether the primary and secondary offenders shared a common intention to inflict the particular s 300(c) injury or injuries on the victim, the actual infliction of such injury being the criminal act which gives rise to the offence of s 300(c) murder (see Daniel Vijay at [167]).",
      "92": "It was thus clear that questions such as whether it was Chia or Febri who struck the mortal blow, or whether Febri had struck more blows than Chia, were ultimately irrelevant, if we were satisfied that Chia and Febri shared a common intention to inflict the particular s 300(c) injuries on the Deceased (these being the craniofacial injuries which were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death). In our judgment, they did share such a common intention.",
      "93": "The starting point of this analysis is that Chia was the mastermind of the plan to abduct the Deceased from the car park and to beat him up severely. As earlier established, Chia\u2019s operative motive was to teach the Deceased a lesson and to exact revenge (see [62]\u2013[68] above). Chia recruited Febri to assist him in carrying out this plan. There was therefore clearly an agreement between Chia and Febri at least to beat up the Deceased severely.",
      "94": "The Defence accepted that Chia had the intention to cause hurt or grievous hurt to the Deceased (see [43] above). However, according to the Defence, this was to be distinguished from Febri\u2019s intention to inflict the fatal craniofacial injuries. In other words, the Defence sought to characterise the present case as one where Chua and Febri shared at most a common intention to cause grievous hurt to the Deceased, but Febri exceeded that common intention by inflicting s 300(c) injuries that Chia did not similarly intend.",
      "95": "We rejected this contention. It was clear from the evidence that Chia and Febri shared a common intention to inflict the fatal craniofacial injuries. As set out at [74]\u2013[80] above, Chia actively assisted in Febri\u2019s assault by restraining the Deceased\u2019s legs while Febri went \u201ccrazy\u201d and repeatedly struck the Deceased\u2019s head with the hammer. At no point did Chia attempt to stop Febri from continuing the assault, even though Chia was in a position to do so, since he had recruited Febri solely to assist him and Febri had no interest in the assault other than to act at Chia\u2019s behest. Instead, Chia deliberately refrained from stopping Febri because he was angry at the Deceased (see [67] above). Beyond that, Chia personally participated in the assault asking Febri to hand him the hammer and by striking the Deceased on the forehead with it. Thereafter, Chia returned the weapon to Febri and so enabled him to continue striking the Deceased\u2019s head. The only inference that can be drawn from all of this was that Chia, as mastermind of the plan, wanted and intended for Febri to inflict the craniofacial injuries on the Deceased that he did.",
      "96": "Thus even if, on the basis of Chia\u2019s evidence, his physical involvement in the actual physical assault was less extensive than Febri\u2019s, Chia cannot be considered a \u201csecondary offender\u201d in the sense that he had a less culpable role. Chia, in fact, was the mastermind of the plan who had hired Febri for the very purpose of carrying out the assault. His failure to instruct Febri to stop the assault, coupled with his active participation, amply established that he and Febri shared the common intention to inflict the fatal craniofacial injuries on the Deceased.",
      "97": "For completeness, we note that at various points in Chia\u2019s 11 January statement, he explicitly stated that he wanted the Deceased dead:",
      "98": "In the face of such evidence, the Defence could not seriously maintain the position that Chia\u2019s intention was limited to only causing hurt to the Deceased and that it was Febri who exceeded their commonly-intended course.",
      "99": "For these reasons, we dismissed Chia\u2019s appeal in CCA 41 and upheld the conviction.",
      "100": "We turn to consider the Prosecution\u2019s appeal against sentence in CCA 40, for which we reserved judgment. As noted at the outset, this appeal raises an important issue regarding the relevance of medical evidence to the exercise of the court\u2019s sentencing discretion in cases involving the imposition of the death sentence.",
      "101": "The Prosecution contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the imposition of the death penalty was not warranted simply because there remained a possibility that Febri, and not Chia, had struck the mortal blow. Aside from this, the Prosecution submits that a proper application of the principles as set out in Kho Jabing (2015) ([23] supra) and Micheal Anak Garing ([32] supra) requires a consideration of four points.",
      "102": "The first point concerns the mental state of the offender. The Prosecution submits that two aspects of this must be taken into consideration. First, Chia was the only one with the motive to cause grievous hurt to the Deceased for the reasons we have already covered (see [14] and [22] above). Second, Chia demonstrated a high degree of planning and premeditation. The Prosecution points to the following:\n(a)     Chia knew to wait for the Deceased at the precise location in question \u2013 the multi-storey car park near his house. The only inference was that he knew the Deceased\u2019s movements well; this was consistent with the police report lodged by the Deceased on 12 July 2013, in which the Deceased stated that Chia had parked under his block and was looking at his unit, and that this was the third such incident in just that month.\n(b)     Chia engaged Febri and Chua to assist him in his plan because he knew that the Deceased was bigger in size.\n(c)     Chia borrowed the van for use in the abduction.\n(d)     Chia procured and brought along knives and other paraphernalia for use in the abduction.\n(e)     Chia knew exactly where to dump the Deceased\u2019s body. The SAF live firing area in Lim Chu Kang was a gated and secluded area, and the body would likely have remained undiscovered for a considerable time if not for his leading the police there on 1 January 2014.\n(f)     Chia made plans to bring Febri out of the jurisdiction after the murder in order to avoid Febri being arrested and possibly giving evidence against him.\n(g)     The only argument that the Defence raised against these submissions was that Chia had been forced to call upon his brother-in-law, Goh \u2013 a person he had not originally intended to involve in the plan \u2013 in the middle of the night and seek his assistance in disposing of the body of the Deceased, all of which suggested a chaotic and unplanned state of affairs. As against this, the Prosecution argues that far from demonstrating Chia\u2019s lack of planning, it demonstrates Chia\u2019s complete presence of mind. Chia realised that without Chua, who by then had abandoned the venture, they required help to dispose of the body because the Deceased was a large man weighing around 80kg. Not only was Goh a somewhat heavyset man who could have been useful for this purpose, he was also a family member and so would have been less likely to report Chia\u2019s actions to the police.",
      "103": "Taken together, the Prosecution submits that the highly premeditated nature of Chia\u2019s offence makes him in relative terms more culpable than the accused persons in other cases involving charges under s 300(c) read with s 34 of the PC such as Kho Jabing (2015) where the offence in question was opportunistic in nature.",
      "104": "The second point concerns whether the offender showed a blatant disregard for human life, in accordance with the test laid down in Kho Jabing (2015) (see [23] above). The Prosecution emphasises that Chia was the mastermind of the plan to attack the Deceased, and the forensic evidence made clear that this attack was extremely brutal. The Deceased was restrained while blows were targeted at his head and face, which are vulnerable regions of the body. As a result, the Deceased suffered extensive fractures of almost every single bone from the bottom of his eye socket to his lower jaw. The attack was so severe that one of his teeth was found lodged in his brain. The forensic evidence was that no typical defensive injuries were found on the Deceased\u2019s body; in other words, it was entirely a one-sided assault without resistance. Further, the brutal attack occurred over a prolonged period, beginning with the abduction in the car park and continuing in the cabin of the van, resulting in a \u201cslow, painful death\u201d for the Deceased. The Deceased was also humiliated by being attacked while his limbs were tied up and then being \u201cunceremoniously dumped in the jungle\u201d. The Prosecution also relies on Chia\u2019s 11 January statement where he states that the plan was to abduct the Deceased, hit him, tie him up, bring him to a remote area and for the trio to have their way with him. Chia\u2019s only regret was that the Deceased died too soon and that they did not have sufficient opportunity to further torture him.",
      "105": "The third point concerns the actual role played by the offender in the commission of the offence. The Prosecution emphasises that Chia was the mastermind of the plan. He recruited Febri for the very purpose of severely beating up the Deceased. Unlike the secondary offender in Micheal Anak Garing ([32] supra) who was in no position to direct or instruct the primary offender, Chia could have told Febri to stop \u2013 but he did not. For this reason, it was not a mitigating factor that Chia\u2019s involvement in the actual physical assault (helping to restrain the Deceased\u2019s legs and personally striking the Deceased on the forehead with the hammer once and then again on the thigh area) was less extensive than Febri\u2019s.",
      "106": "Finally, the fourth point concerns the circumstances of the particular offender. The Prosecution submits that there are no mitigating factors at all. On the day of the offence, Chia appeared perfectly normal and even attended a wedding in the morning. He calmly executed the attack that night, even retaining the presence of mind to call Goh for assistance when Chua abandoned the plan. After the murder, Chia set out to evade detection by disposing of the Deceased\u2019s belongings and the hammer. He washed the bloodstains off the van, refuelled it and returned it to Ong while apologising for and promising to replace the missing components (which he had removed during the clean-up). Finally, Chia calmly left for Malaysia with his wife and two daughters for their family trip, taking the opportunity to spirit Febri out of the jurisdiction. The Prosecution also submits that Chia demonstrated no remorse at all. At trial, he tried to avoid liability by fabricating the character \u201cAli\u201d; and when that version of accounts was rejected, Chia tried to blame everything on Febri. Significantly, the only regret that Chia expressed was that the Deceased had died too quickly.",
      "107": "The Defence on the other hand submits that the sentence of life imprisonment is not manifestly inadequate and should be upheld.",
      "108": "First, the Defence argues that Chia\u2019s actions could not be said to be such as would outrage the feelings of the community. Chia\u2019s plan was not to kill or murder the Deceased; it was only to abduct the Deceased and to teach him a lesson. The death that resulted was unplanned and unexpected. Further, the plan was not driven by hatred or revenge for the Deceased, but by love for his wife: Chia wanted to protect Mdm Goh from humiliation by any further dissemination of the recordings. Having regard to this underlying motivation, Chia\u2019s actions could not be said to be so outrageous.",
      "109": "Next, the Defence submits that Chia did not exhibit viciousness or blatant disregard for human life. The Defence submits that the assault in the car park and in the van was not as one-sided as the Prosecution submits. The evidence does not conclusively show that the Deceased had been tied up with the nylon cords before the assault; the possibility remained that he was only tied up after. Further, the Defence emphasises that for the purposes of sentencing, it is necessary to determine the actual role or participation of the particular offender in the attack (see Micheal Anak Garing at [54]). Chia\u2019s actual role was limited to his hitting the Deceased on the forehead once and on the thigh area using the hammer. Again, the Defence makes the point that it was Febri who inflicted the fatal craniofacial injuries on the Deceased.",
      "110": "The Defence also makes the following points in response to the Prosecution\u2019s submissions:\n(a)     Chia did not execute the plan in a calm and calculated manner. The events were chaotic and Chia was forced to make a frantic phone call to Goh at around 3.00am after Chua abandoned the enterprise.\n(b)     Chia did not take deliberate steps to avoid detection. If he did, he would have returned to the car park to remove any evidence that an assault had taken place there. He did not wash the van in order to evade detection, but rather, because he had to return the van to Ong in its original condition so far as this was possible to do.\n(c)     Chia had not allowed Febri to accompany him to Malaysia with the specific intention of helping Febri to escape the jurisdiction. If that was his intention, logically Chia himself should have wanted to flee. Instead, he returned to Singapore.\n(d)     Chia did not display a lack of remorse. At the mitigation stage, he did admit to playing a part in the assault on the Deceased.",
      "111": "Finally, the Defence submits that there are two mitigating factors that warrant the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment instead of the death penalty. First, Chia assisted the police by leading them to the location where the body of the Deceased had been dumped. Second, and more importantly, according to the Lee Report tendered by the Defence, Chia suffered from major depressive disorder (\u201cMDD\u201d) at the material time in 2013, which affected \u201chis perceptions, his emotional responses [and] his behavio[u]ral responses\u201d, and \u201ccontributed much to his disturbed mental state around the time of the offence\u201d [emphasis in original omitted].",
      "112": "The diagnosis in the Lee Report stood in contrast with the report of the Prosecution\u2019s psychiatric expert, Dr Bharat Saluja, dated 4 February 2014, which found that Chia did not suffer from any mental disorder and had normal intelligence adaptive functioning. At trial, Dr Saluja\u2019s opinion was not challenged at all and no suggestion of any mental impairment was advanced by the Defence. Nonetheless, the Defence contends that the Lee Report ought to be preferred because Dr Lee conversed with Chia in Mandarin (which Chia was comfortable in) and not in English, as Dr Saluja did. There was some suggestion that the language barrier had prevented Dr Saluja from fully and accurately comprehending Chia. Further, Dr Lee elicited more personal information from Chia and his family. As a result, Dr Lee had a deeper and more extensive understanding of Chia\u2019s background and mental state leading up to the accident.",
      "113": "The legal principles relating to the imposition of the death penalty are not in dispute. The relevant principles enunciated by this court in Kho Jabing (2015) ([23] supra) and Micheal Anak Garing ([32] supra) can be summarised as follows:\n(a)     The death penalty will be warranted where the actions of the offender outrage the feelings of the community. Capital punishment is appropriate if the offender\u2019s actions are \u201cso grievous an affront to humanity and so abhorrent that the death penalty may ... be the appropriate, if not the only, adequate sentence\u201d (Kho Jabing (2015) at [44]).\n(b)     The actions of the offender would outrage the feelings of the community if the offender had acted in a way which exhibits viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life. The manner in which the offender has acted is a critical inquiry: the number of stabs or blows, the area of the injury, the duration of the attack and the force used are all relevant considerations. For instance, in the case of a violent act causing death, the savagery of the attack would be indicative of the offender\u2019s disregard for human life (Kho Jabing (2015) at [45]).\n(c)     In deciding whether an offender has acted in blatant disregard for human life, two particular factors are relevant: (i) the mental state of the offender at the time of the attack; and (ii) his actual role or participation in the attack (Micheal Anak Garing at [54]). By way of illustration, in Micheal Anak Garing, the inquiry on the first point centred on whether the secondary offender, Tony Anak Imba, only had the intention to inflict a s 300(c) injury without more, or whether his intention went beyond than that \u2013 for instance, whether he knew that the primary offender would in all likelihood use the weapon indiscriminately in attacking the deceased (at [55]\u2013[56]). The inquiry on the second point concerned whether Imba had held the deceased in an armlock for a significant period of time, allowing the primary offender to inflict the fatal injuries (at [57]\u2013[60]). We observed that if there had been more certain evidence that Imba had in fact held onto the deceased as described above or had otherwise egged on the primary offender, the death penalty might have been warranted (at [62]).\n(d)     In any event, all the circumstances must be weighed, including the motive and intention of the offender at the time he committed the offence. While \u201cthe offender\u2019s regard for human life remains at the forefront of the court\u2019s consideration, other factors such as the offender\u2019s age and intelligence could well tilt the balance\u201d (Kho Jabing (2015) at [51(d)]).",
      "114": "We begin by considering the submission of the Defence that Chia\u2019s MDD is a relevant mitigating factor, and take the opportunity to explore whether and how an offender\u2019s mental condition may be relevant to sentencing in cases involving the imposition of the discretionary death sentence under s 302(2) of the PC.",
      "115": "As a matter of general principle, mental conditions are relevant to sentencing if they lessen the offender\u2019s culpability for the offence and therefore justify a reduced sentence. As we stated in Lim Ghim Peow v PP [2014] 4 SLR 1287, the extent of such relevance depends on the circumstances of each case, in particular the nature and severity of the mental condition (at [25]). It is imperative that the sentencing court \u201cexamine the nature and gravity of the offender\u2019s mental disorder and its impact on the commission of the offence before arriving at a sentence that takes into account and balances the relevant sentencing objectives\u201d (at [52]).",
      "116": "In our judgment, the same general principle applies in cases involving the possible imposition of the death penalty. The culpability of the offender is measured by whether his actions outrage the feelings of the community, and this in turn is measured by whether the offender acted viciously or in blatant disregard for human life (see [110] above). Thus the offender\u2019s mental condition is relevant in so far as it bears on the question of whether the offender can be said to have acted viciously or with blatant disregard for human life. By way of illustration, it may be established that an offender\u2019s mental condition significantly diminished his capacity to comprehend his actions or appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct at the material time. This might militate against a finding that the offender acted in blatant disregard of human life (as compared to an offender who acted with full knowledge and appreciation of the gravity of his actions), because the apparent viciousness of the attack would, at least in part, be attributable to the fact that the offender was suffering from that mental condition at the relevant time. In such circumstances, the retributive principle ought to be given less weight, militating against the imposition of the death penalty.",
      "117": "In other words, the proper test in relation to the relevance of medical evidence in the context of cases involving the discretionary death sentence is whether a causal link has been established between the diagnosis of the mental condition and the factors that go towards the imposition of the death penalty. This, of course, presupposes that there is in the first place, a diagnosis of a recognised medical condition that the court is able to accept on the evidence.",
      "118": "If either the diagnosis itself or the causal link is contested, then a Newton hearing should be held. We emphasise that the purpose of a Newton hearing is to enable the court to resolve a difficult question of contested facts that is material to the court\u2019s determination of the appropriate sentence (see Ng Chun Hian v PP [2014] 2 SLR 783 at [24]). It is not an opportunity for either party to supplement its case and introduce new facts which have not already been put before the sentencing court.",
      "119": "In the present case, applying the test set out at [114] above, the key question before us is whether the Lee Report, which contains a diagnosis of MDD, sufficiently establishes a causal link between that diagnosis and the factors that go towards the imposition of the death penalty. If so, Chia\u2019s MDD may be taken into account as a mitigating factor in the sentencing exercise. However, prior to considering the question of the causal link, it is necessary to determine whether there is a proper diagnosis of a recognised medical condition in the first place. It is therefore appropriate to first evaluate the quality of the Lee Report, which is the sole basis for the submission of the Defence that Chia suffered from MDD at the material time.",
      "120": "The principles relating to expert evidence bear emphasis. First and foremost, an expert must be neutral and independent. A useful starting point is O 40A r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe Rules\u201d). While the Rules apply to civil proceedings only, the principles relating to an expert\u2019s duty to the court set out therein are equally applicable to criminal proceedings. As stated in O 40A rr 2(1) and 2(2) of the Rules respectively, the duty of an expert is to assist the court on matters within his expertise and this duty \u201coverrides any obligation to the person from whom he has received instructions or by whom he is paid\u201d. An expert should neither attempt nor be seen to be an advocate of for a party\u2019s cause. That being said, it is \u201centirely permissible for him to propound and press home the opinion he seeks to persuade the court to accept\u201d (see Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 (\u201cPacific Recreation\u201d) at [70], citing Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd v Pang Seng Meng [2004] 4 SLR(R) 162 at [82]\u2013[83]). The court \u201cwill not hesitate, in an appropriate case, to disregard or even draw an adverse inference against expert evidence that exceeds the judicially determined boundaries of coherence, rationality and impartiality\u201d (see Pacific Recreation at [71], citing JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v Teofoongwonglcloong [2007] 4 SLR(R) 460 at [63]).",
      "121": "It is also critical that an expert provides the reasoning behind his conclusions. A report that states conclusions without reasons and which cannot be probed or evaluated is useless and prone to be rejected. In this connection, our observations in Pacific Recreation (at [85]) bear repeating:",
      "122": "Although Pacific Recreation was a case which involved an expert witness on foreign law, there is no reason why the basic principles relating to an expert\u2019s duty to give reasons that were enunciated there should not apply equally in the context of criminal cases where expert medical evidence is provided by psychiatrists. As noted by the High Court in Chong Yee Ka v PP [2017] 4 SLR 309, whether appointed by the Prosecution or the Defence, a psychiatrist \u201cought to do his utmost to assist the court\u201d. He should \u201cstate his opinion as definitively as possible to the best of his ability, avoiding ambiguity and minimising room for subjectivity in interpretation. Otherwise, his opinion may be unhelpful and unreliable\u201d (at [49]). Ultimately, if the psychiatric report appears \u201ccontrived and flimsy\u201d, or the psychiatric report does not show that the offender is \u201csuffering from a clearly diagnosed and recognised psychiatric disorder\u201d, the court will be justified in rejecting the evidence of the offender\u2019s purported mental condition (Kow Keng Siong, Sentencing Principles in Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2009) at para 18.139, citing PP v Goh Lee Yin [2008] 1 SLR(R) 824 at [82]).",
      "123": "Bearing all these principles in mind, we turn to consider the Lee Report proper. For ease of reference, we set out a summary of the main findings of the Lee Report in the paragraphs that follow.",
      "124": "The Lee Report, which spanned 15 pages, was prepared with reference to court papers and interviews conducted with Chia, Mdm Goh and their two daughters between April and May 2017. The Lee Report detailed the development of the relationship between Mdm Goh and the Deceased, what was described as Mdm Goh\u2019s \u201cmental disturbance\u201d in 2013 arising from the Deceased\u2019s refusal to \u201creturn\u201d the recordings, and Chia\u2019s own mood and behavioural changes as a result of \u201cthe sorrow and changes in [Mdm Goh] which he witnessed daily\u201d. The Lee Report reported Chia as saying, among other things, that he felt depressed for most of 2013, stopped going to the coffee shop which he used to enjoy frequenting, contemplated suicide, and had recurrent and persistent thoughts about how he could retrieve the recordings and \u201cprotect [Mdm Goh\u2019s] dignity\u201d.",
      "125": "The main conclusion of the Lee Report was that Chia suffered from MDD around the period of the offence in December 2013. In the section titled \u201cSummary and Opinions\u201d, Dr Lee opined that the following mood and behavioural changes in Chia \u201c[met] the diagnoses of the mental disorder\u201d:\n(a)     Over a period of several months in 2013, Chia experienced depression and a loss of sense of pleasure almost daily, suffered from affected sleep and appetite, and was more easily agitated and had to smoke more to keep his mood under control.\n(b)     Chia had \u201crecurrent ruminating thoughts\u201d about the Deceased and the recordings which were \u201cintrusive and unwarranted\u201d. Dr Lee opined that these thoughts were of sufficient duration and frequency as to be considered \u201cobsessions\u201d, and that this was consistent with the statements of the Deceased that he felt he was being \u201cstalked\u201d.",
      "126": "Dr Lee opined that Chia\u2019s MDD in 2013 had been triggered by stressors that were \u201csevere and persistent\u201d, and which related to his perception of the need to protect his family. These stressors included:\n(a)     Mdm Goh\u2019s unstable mental state in 2013 which affected him daily;\n(b)     Chia\u2019s obsession with the Deceased and the recordings, and his belief that he had received \u201caffirmation\u201d from various mediums and gods that the Deceased had used the recordings to practise black magic or to cast a spell on Mdm Goh;\n(c)     Chia\u2019s \u201cpersistent heightened vigilance to protect his family from further spells\u201d; and\n(d)     Chia\u2019s \u201ccultural tradition to maintain a stoic front\u201d for his family.",
      "127": "Overall, Dr Lee opined that although Chia\u2019s MDD did not qualify for diminished responsibility, it had \u201caffected his perceptions, emotional responses [and] his behavio[u]ral responses\u201d, and \u201ccontributed much to his disturbed mental state around the time of the offence\u201d [emphasis in original omitted]. For present purposes, it is important to note that this portion of the Lee Report did not contain any further explanation or elaboration at all. As we explain below, this was a critical flaw which severely undermined the quality of the Lee Report.",
      "128": "In our assessment, although the Lee Report contains, on its face, a diagnosis of a recognised medical condition, the overall quality of the Lee Report is so lacking that it fails to meet the minimum standards of expert evidence, and must therefore be disregarded. We explain our reasons below.",
      "129": "First, there was no explanation of how the mood and behavioural changes allegedly observed in Chia \u201c[met] the diagnoses of [MDD]\u201d. Other than a cursory reference to the \u201cAmerican Psychiatric Association 2013\u201d, the Lee Report did not provide any definition or explanation of MDD, let alone specify the key symptoms of such a medical condition. Without this key information, it is impossible for us to assess the correctness of the conclusion or the cogency of the reasoning.",
      "130": "Second, the mood and behavioural changes and \u201cstressors\u201d cited by Dr Lee for the basis of his diagnosis of MDD were, in large part, based on self-reported information by Chia, including his version of events. However, some of those were not accepted facts. As the Prosecution rightly points out, the account that the Deceased had gone to Chia\u2019s flat on the first and 15th days of Chinese New Year in 2013 and that the Deceased had shown the recordings to people in Chia\u2019s neighbourhood had never been established in the trial below. It is unclear to us whether Dr Lee\u2019s diagnosis of MDD would be maintained if these disputed facts are disregarded.",
      "131": "Third, the Lee Report omitted or failed to consider certain key materials. The entirety of the section titled \u201c[Chia\u2019s] account of the offence\u201d comprised just three short paragraphs. It provided no detail about what actually occurred during the offence and simply reiterated Chia\u2019s alleged overwhelming desire to retrieve the recordings from the Deceased. Critically, there was no consideration of the narrative of the offence contained in Chia\u2019s statements to the police, in particular his 11 January statement, where Chia admitted to joining Febri in the assault on the Deceased with the hammer, and also explicitly stated at various points that while hitting the Deceased, Chia wanted the Deceased to die.",
      "132": "Fourth, the Lee Report was devoid of reasoning and purely conclusory in nature. As alluded to above, there was no explanation or elaboration in relation to the crucial conclusion that MDD \u201caffected\u201d or \u201ccontributed much to\u201d Chia\u2019s mental state around the time of the offence [emphasis in original omitted]. The language employed in the Lee Report lacked specificity and elaboration, and could lend itself to any number of interpretations. For instance, since Chia\u2019s mood and behaviours were \u201caffected\u201d, it could mean that Chia had impulse control issues or had become more prone to violence. On the other hand, it could also mean that Chia did all that he did, just because he was upset that his wife had had an affair with the Deceased. Simply put, it is impossible to determine from such vague phrasing what the Lee Report really meant and it inevitably raises the question as to whether this was calculatedly so.",
      "133": "Finally, the Lee Report was, in our judgment, partisan and contrived at parts. We refer in this regard to a particularly curious paragraph in the section titled \u201cMental state examination\u201d, which we reproduce below:",
      "134": "This portrayed Chia as a husband who only did what he did because he wanted to protect his wife from humiliation, and who regretted having caused the Deceased\u2019s death because all he wanted to do was to retrieve the recordings. However, it conveniently ignored existing narratives of the offence, and was simply inconsistent with Chia\u2019s own statements to the police. It is difficult to avoid forming the impression that the inclusion of Chia\u2019s \u201cthree wishes\u201d (or more accurately, four wishes) was a calculated attempt to extract sympathy from the court, and in effect, attempting to advocate for Chia rather than seeking to provide real, independent assistance to the court.",
      "135": "Therefore, having regard to the principles set out at [117]\u2013[119] above, we conclude that the Lee Report fails to meet the minimum standards of expert evidence. It is ambiguous, wholly lacking in reasoning and simply states conclusions. It is also partisan and contrived at parts. In the premises, we entirely disregard it.",
      "136": "Even if the Lee Report were to be accepted as it stands, it would not meet the threshold of relevance because there is nothing in it which establishes the necessary causal link between the diagnosis of MDD and the factors that go towards the imposition of the death penalty. The Lee Report only contained vague conclusory statements to the effect that MDD would have \u201caffected\u201d or \u201ccontributed much to\u201d Chia\u2019s mental state around the time of the offence [emphasis in original omitted]. There was no explanation of how Chia\u2019s mental condition bore any relevance to whether he had acted viciously or in blatant disregard for human life, and therefore whether his actions would outrage the feelings of the community.",
      "137": "For completeness, we are satisfied that it is not necessary to convene a Newton hearing to determine whether a diagnosis of MDD may be sustained or the causal link between MDD and the factors that go towards the imposition of the death penalty, given that we disregard the Lee Report entirely, and also because even if it were admitted as it stands, there is nothing in it that would be relevant to the question of sentence, as explained in the preceding paragraph.",
      "138": "Before leaving this point, we wish to briefly address the criticism raised in the Lee Report that Dr Saluja had allegedly:",
      "139": "This was yet another example of an unsubstantiated assertion in the Lee Report. There was simply no elaboration on what \u201ccritical mental health symptoms\u201d or \u201cincongruence\u201d Dr Saluja was expected to pick up on. We digress to note that if any \u201cincongruence\u201d should have been picked up, it would have been the obvious inconsistencies between Chia\u2019s responses in his examination by Dr Lee as compared to his contemporaneous accounts of the offence as provided in the statements to the police. It is also, in our view, most unfair to make these belated allegations against a fellow medical practitioner in circumstances where the medical evidence in question had gone entirely unchallenged at trial.",
      "140": "We turn finally to consider the parties\u2019 remaining submissions on whether Chia\u2019s actions warrant the imposition of the death penalty. In this regard, most of the submissions made by the Defence fall away in view of our findings in CCA 41.",
      "141": "First, we have found that Chia was the mastermind of the plan to abduct the Deceased from the car park and to beat up the Deceased severely (see [62]\u2013[68] above). His operative motive was to exact revenge on the Deceased. On this basis, we reject the submission by the Defence that Chia was motivated by love and that he only wanted to retrieve the recordings from the Deceased.",
      "142": "We also reject the submission of the Defence to the effect that an inquiry into the offender\u2019s \u201cactual role and participation in the attack\u201d (a relevant consideration in determining whether the death penalty should be imposed: see Micheal Anak Garing ([32] supra) at [54], cited at [110(c)] above) necessarily requires the court to attribute each blow to a particular offender. Chia shared a common intention with Febri to inflict the fatal craniofacial injuries on the Deceased (see [89]\u2013[94] above). We reiterate our earlier observation that for this reason, and at least in the context of this case, it is irrelevant that Chia\u2019s actual involvement in the physical assault was more limited than Febri\u2019s, and that it was possible that Febri was the one who inflicted the fatal s 300(c) injuries (see [89] above). We say this because Chia was the mastermind who not only directed but also actively participated in the assault that killed the Deceased. It seems to us that one who hires an assassin to kill another or who otherwise controls a killer, cannot be less culpable than the one who does the killing. If that is correct, still less can it be relevant where the mastermind not only directs but actually participates in the killing.",
      "143": "In this connection, it is apposite to contrast the present case with Micheal Anak Garing. In that case, Imba (the secondary offender), Garing (the primary offender) and two of their friends embarked on their plan to commit robbery. Garing was armed with a parang. Imba initiated the attack against the deceased by knocking him off his bicycle. The group then set upon him. It was undisputed that Garing inflicted the fatal injuries to the deceased\u2019s neck; the critical question was whether Imba had held the deceased in an armlock for a sufficiently long period of time so as to allow Garing to inflict those injuries. We found that there was insufficient evidence to prove this. Overall, having regard to Imba\u2019s mental state (meaning his intention to inflict a s 300(c) injury and his knowledge that Garing would in all likelihood wield the parang indiscriminately) and his actual involvement in the attack on the deceased, we concluded that Imba did not act in blatant disregard for human life and thus the imposition of the death penalty was not warranted (at [57]\u2013[62]). The similarities between Imba and Chia\u2019s circumstances begin and end with the fact that their actual involvement in the physical assault was relatively limited. The critical distinguishing factor is that Chia, unlike Imba, was the mastermind of the plan to attack the victim. Thus even if Febri had inflicted the majority of the blows, Febri had done so pursuant to Chia\u2019s plan. Chia did not at any point in time direct or instruct Febri to stop although he was in a position to do so (see [92] above). In contrast, Imba did not instruct Garing to inflict the fatal neck injuries; neither was Imba in a position to stop Garing from doing so. In the circumstances, Chia cannot be regarded as an ordinary \u201csecondary offender\u201d like Imba, whose actual role and participation in the attack was limited. Chia must bear responsibility for Febri\u2019s actions which were undertaken at his direction and with his active participation.",
      "144": "We also note that as the mastermind, Chia demonstrated a high degree of planning and premeditation. We agree with the Prosecution\u2019s submissions that there is overwhelming evidence which amply demonstrates that this was not an opportunistic crime (see [99] above). This distinguishes the present case from Kho Jabing (2015) ([23] supra), where the offenders were both unarmed when they decided to rob the victim. They made weapons out of the materials around them only as they approached the victim: one of them had armed himself with a belt wrapped around his fist with the metal buckle exposed, while the other had picked up a piece of wood from the ground. The opportunistic and improvised use of weapons in Kho Jabing (2015) stands in stark contrast with the meticulous planning that permeated every aspect of the venture to abduct and harm the Deceased in this case.",
      "145": "Second, the viciousness of the attack cannot be denied. The objective forensic evidence speaks for itself. Bloodstains were found on the ground near the Deceased\u2019s car, on its windows as well as on the ceiling of the car park above the car (see [69]\u2013[70] above). Bloodstains were also found on the ceiling, rear door and both side walls of the cabin of the van; further, a wooden floorboard that was originally in the cabin of the van was stained with blood (see [71] above). This showed that a violent assault against the Deceased had already commenced in the car park where he was abducted, and continued in the cabin of the van. The various blunt force blows were directed at the Deceased\u2019s face, a vulnerable part of his body. As a result of the assault, the Deceased suffered extensive fractures in his skull: almost every bone from the bottom of his eye socket to his lower jaw was fractured (see [101] above).",
      "146": "Third, Chia demonstrated a blatant disregard for the life of the Deceased. We need only refer to various statements that Chia made in his 11 January statement, which we have already cited at [65], [79] and [94] above. Viewed as a whole, the unmistakeable picture that emerges is that Chia desired for the Deceased to suffer as much as possible before dying. The only regret that Chia ever expressed was that the Deceased had died before he could cause the Deceased even more suffering. We also agree with the Prosecution that the evidence showed Chia to have remained calm, collected and deliberate before and throughout the execution of the offence. He remained so even after the killing \u2013 on the very day that he murdered the Deceased and dumped the battered body in a secluded area, Chia was able take a two-day long trip to Malaysia with his wife and two young daughters.",
      "147": "The death sentence is the final and terminal sentence which a convicted person can suffer, and where it is at the discretion of the court, it should only be imposed after the most anxious consideration. Such consideration is to be guided by the jurisprudence of the court, for that is the only assurance that the gravest of judicial tasks is undertaken in accordance with the law. Having regard to all the facts and circumstances, we agree with the Prosecution that Chia\u2019s actions exhibited such viciousness and such a blatant disregard for the life of the Deceased, and are so grievous an affront to humanity and so abhorrent that the death penalty is the appropriate, indeed the only adequate sentence.",
      "148": "For these reasons, we allow the Prosecution\u2019s appeal against sentence in CCA 40, and substitute the sentence of life imprisonment with the sentence of death."

      "1": "On 14 February 2018, the accused (\u201cthe Accused\u201d) was convicted of the charge (\u201cthe Charge\u201d) which was framed under s 307(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cPC\u201d) for attempted murder causing hurt:",
      "2": "The background to the offence has been set out in detail in PP v BPK [2018] SGHC 34 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d) and I will not repeat it here. There, issues relating to the Accused\u2019s capacity to form mens rea at the material time, his factual intention at that time, and the partial defence of provocation have also been discussed. For reasons stated in the Judgment, I found that the Prosecution had proven the Charge beyond a reasonable doubt and that the partial defence of provocation was not made out.",
      "3": "On 30 April 2018, having heard the parties\u2019 submissions, I sentenced the Accused to 14 years\u2019 imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The term of imprisonment was backdated to 21 December 2013. These are my grounds of decision. For ease of reference, I adopt the abbreviations used in the Judgment.",
      "4": "The Prosecution urged the court to impose a sentence of at least 14 years\u2019 imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, based on the following:\n(a)     The paramount sentencing considerations in this case were deterrence, both general and specific, as well as retribution. In particular, general deterrence was needed for offences such as the present which was committed in anger and out of vengeance.\n(b)     There were several aggravating factors including that:\n(i)       the offence was premeditated;\n(ii)       the offence was committed in a public place and caused public disquiet;\n(iii)       the assault was particularly vicious and violent; and\n(iv)       the assault had long-term implications on the Victim\u2019s well-being.\n(c)     As a matter of precedent, the present case warranted a heavier sentence than that imposed in PP v Ravindran Annamalai [2013] SGHC 77 (\u201cRavindran\u201d), which was to date the only case under s 307(1) of the PC since the amendment of the provision in 2007. In this regard, cases under s 304(a) of the PC for culpable homicide not amounting to murder were not appropriate precedents.\n(d)     The sentence urged was justifiable based on the Prosecution\u2019s proposed sentencing framework for attempted murder.",
      "5": "The Defence submitted that the appropriate sentence was no more than eight years\u2019 imprisonment with no caning, or alternatively, not more than two strokes of the cane. The following main arguments were made:\n(a)     Deterrence, whether general or specific, did not have a role in the present case. Retribution had been met by the fact, amongst other things, that the Accused was going to \u201cpay[] very heavily for the sin he was drawn into\u201d. Mercy should therefore be shown to him.\n(b)     The following factors should be taken into account:\n(i)       The assault arose in the context of a relationship between the Accused and the Victim where the Victim was \u201cessentially having fun at [the Accused\u2019s] emotional expense\u201d.\n(ii)       The location of the offence was fortuitous, and there was no evidence of public alarm or threat to public safety.\n(iii)       The Accused was remorseful, had no antecedents, and was of good character.\n(iv)       A long custodial term would cause hardship to the Accused\u2019s parents.\n(v)       The likelihood that the Accused would be repatriated upon his release from prison was itself punishment for him.\n(c)     As for the precedents, the Defence relied on PP v Seng Inn Thye [2003] SGHC 88 (\u201cSeng Inn Thye\u201d) which it argued remained relevant even though this was decided before the 2007 amendments to s 307 of the PC. It further argued that Ravindran, which was the precedent cited by the Prosecution, was factually distinguishable from the present case.",
      "6": "Section 307(1) of the PC provides for the offence of attempted murder:",
      "7": "As I observed in the Judgment at [322], s 307(1) of the PC has two limbs. The first limb provides that for attempted murder simpliciter, the accused \u201cshall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years, and shall also be liable to fine\u201d. The second limb provides that for attempted murder causing hurt, the accused \u201cshall be liable to either imprisonment for life, or to imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to caning or fine or both\u201d. In the present case, the Charge was brought and the Accused was convicted under the second limb of s 307(1) of the PC.",
      "8": "In my judgment, the paramount sentencing considerations in the present case were general deterrence and retribution.",
      "9": "Specific deterrence was not totally irrelevant. The Prosecution submitted that an enhanced sentence accounting for specific deterrence was necessary for the following reasons:\n(a)     It is necessary to remind the Accused that using violence out of anger and for vengeance would not be condoned.\n(b)     The Accused had admitted at several instances in his police statements that he had wanted to kill the Victim.\n(c)     The Accused\u2019s belief that the Victim owed him fidelity \u201cexpose[d] his perverse sense of entitlement\u201d.",
      "10": "I agreed that the first reason was a factor to be taken into account. While it was true that the Accused\u2019s strong feelings had arisen out of his romantic relationship with the Victim, this was not to say that he would never have another romantic relationship or be in a situation where his strong emotions may again be stirred. That said, in so far as the Accused was not a local citizen or permanent resident, he would likely be repatriated at the end of his sentence, and this militated against giving paramount consideration to specific deterrence (see Zhao Zhipeng v PP [2008] 4 SLR(R) 879 at [28]). As for the second reason, the Accused\u2019s admissions in his statements were evidential points with little, if any, relevance to sentencing. I also did not agree that the Accused by desiring fidelity from the Victim (whether rightly or wrongly) could be characterised as having a \u201cperverse sense of entitlement\u201d, or that such entitlement would in itself warrant a sentence for specific deterrence. In the broader context, it was not shown that the Accused was recalcitrant or had a higher propensity for reoffending. Thus, specific deterrence, while relevant, was not a paramount sentencing consideration.",
      "11": "General deterrence was necessary to send the important signal that the law would not condone violence as a solution to problems, however personal they may be, and however angry or justified one might feel. The Defence argued that in Singapore it was \u201cnot a common phenomenon that someone will murder his or her lover whenever there is love failure\u201d. It was not clear that violent crimes arising out of lovers\u2019 disputes were as uncommon as assumed by the Defence. In any event, the focus here was on the law\u2019s expectation of self-restraint even in moments of grave anger and in relation to disputes of a personal nature, and this reminder was relevant to more than just the Accused. As the Court of Appeal in PP v Leong Soon Kheong [2009] 4 SLR(R) 63 stated (at [61]), \u201c[n]o one is entitled to exact violence in order to seek redress for grievances whether real or imagined\u201d.",
      "12": "Retribution was also important to address the Accused\u2019s highly culpable state of mind at the time of the offence, and to vindicate the Victim\u2019s interests given the extensive injuries that she suffered as a result of the assault, some of which were life-threatening and/or permanent. The Defence asked for mercy on the basis that the Accused would \u201cpay[] with his future, the dishonourable name that he has earned for his family and the hardship that had befallen on his parents and dependants\u201d. I was not persuaded. Retributive justice required that, within the limits of proportionality, the punishment imposed must reflect and befit the gravity of one\u2019s crime. None of the factors raised by the Defence was relevant to the Accused\u2019s culpability or the harm caused. As for their significance as offender-specific mitigating factors, I will elaborate more on this later (see [31]\u2013[34] below).",
      "13": "I turn now to explain my consideration of the sentencing factors applicable in this case. In this regard, I will focus first on the offence-specific factors, which relate to the manner and mode in which the offence was committed and which would assist the court in assessing the twin factors of culpability and harm, before turning to the offender-specific factors, which are personal to the offender and relate to his particular personal circumstances (see Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP [2017] 2 SLR 449 at [39]; Logachev Vladislav v PP [2018] 4 SLR 609 (\u201cLogachev\u201d) at [34]\u2013[36]).",
      "14": "In relation to the harm caused by the offence, I noted at the outset that the Victim had suffered extensive injuries as a result of the assault, some of which were life-threatening and/or permanent. These injuries were tabulated in the Judgment ([2] supra) at [285] as follows:",
      "15": "In the present case, it was not disputed that there were serious injuries which were life-threatening. As I noted in the Judgment at [303], Dr Thomas Loh, the specialist involved in the management of the wounds on the Victim\u2019s head and neck, had testified that without medical intervention in the form of haemostasis and ligation, the Victim would have continued to bleed and eventually gone into a life-threatening haemorrhagic shock. The parties also agreed that, at the very least, the Victim\u2019s injuries fell within the definition of grievous hurt under s 320(h) of the PC which provides for \u201cany hurt which endangers life, or which causes the sufferer to be, during the space of 20 days, in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits\u201d. Fortunately, due to the timely intervention by the doctors, the Victim was saved.",
      "16": "Also fortunately, the Victim was not permanently incapacitated. I say this, however, only in an attenuated sense, because while the Victim was able to continue with her job and most other aspects of her life, some of her injuries were permanent. For instance, the assault left multiple scars on the Victim. According to the victim impact statement, this negatively impacted her confidence. In particular, because her occupation required her to tie her hair up, that revealed the scar on her neck to persons who met her and invited probing questions about the traumatising assault. As a result of injuries to her left facial nerve, the Victim also had difficulties smiling, talking, and closing her left eye properly. Emotionally, the Victim has had difficulties sleeping, flashbacks of the incident, irrational fear, and she no longer felt safe being alone. In my view, it was clear that the assault had long-term implications on the Victim\u2019s well-being.",
      "17": "Further, I should add that while the extent of the injuries caused went primarily towards the indicium of harm, it was also indicative of the Accused\u2019s culpability. As Sundaresh Menon CJ explained in Logachev, the categorisation of sentencing factors under the rubric of harm and culpability \u201cis simply intended to provide a convenient framework ... [n]ot too much should be made of the labels ... and the categories may not always be watertight\u201d (at [38]). In this regard, the following passage of the Judgement (at [290]) was relevant:",
      "18": "After bearing in mind the need to avoid double-counting a sentencing factor or giving it undue weight, I was of the view that some weight should still be given to the relentless nature of the Accused\u2019s attack on the Victim in assessing his culpability.",
      "19": "As for the other indicia of the Accused\u2019s culpability, I was of the view that the primary factor was the finding that the Accused had harboured an intention to kill the Victim at the material time. As I explained in the Judgment at [126], drawing from s 300 of the PC providing for the offence of murder, there were four alternative limbs of mens rea under s 307(1) of the PC for attempted murder, which may be summarised as follows:\n(a)     intention to cause death (s 300(a));\n(b)     intention to cause such bodily injury as the accused knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused (s 300(b));\n(c)     intention to cause bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death (s 300(c)); and\n(d)     knowledge that his act is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death (s 300(d)).",
      "20": "The Accused\u2019s intention to kill the Victim at the material time of the offence represented the most culpable of the states of mens rea. This suggested a high degree of culpability which should be reflected in the sentence imposed.",
      "21": "Further, I also considered it aggravating that the Accused had used a deadly weapon and, relatedly, that he had to some extent pre-planned the assault on the Victim. In the Judgment ([2] supra), I held that the Accused did possess the requisite intention to kill the Victim at the material time of the offence. In fact, the night before the offence, the Accused had taken a knife of around 33cm from his kitchen and hidden it in his right sock before subsequently proceeding to look for the Victim at the Block (see the Judgment at [45], [59], [69] and [313]). The Prosecution\u2019s submission was that the Accused had gone to the Block \u201cfor the sole purpose of killing [the Victim]\u201d. On the evidence, it was not clear whether the Accused had formed the intention to kill the Victim at the time he took the knife or sometime later before he assaulted her. Even if it was the latter, I was of the view that he had at least formed an intention to injure the Victim when he took the knife and hid it. As I explained in the Judgment at [308]\u2013[319], I was not persuaded that the Accused had spontaneously committed the offence upon having sight of an allegedly provocative wallpaper on the Victim\u2019s handphone immediately prior to the assault.",
      "22": "On that premise, the fact that the Accused had taken preparatory steps to give effect to his intention to injure the Victim should be considered an aggravating factor, even though the Charge and conviction were on the basis that he had an intention to kill at the material time of the assault. The two states of mind were highly proximate and both involved the use of physical violence against the Victim. Further, the preparatory steps taken evidenced that the Accused had acted with deliberation rather than out of a momentary lapse in judgment.",
      "23": "I also considered relevant the fact that the offence had caused public disquiet. The assault took place at the void deck of the Block. In the Judgment, I noted that a total of 15 first information reports had been lodged on 20 December 2013 by members of the public in relation to the assault (at [54]). These reports illustrated varying degrees of alarm and distress. For instance, one of the unrelated witnesses stated that he had been sleeping in his room when he heard \u201ca female voice screaming hysterically\u201d. The screaming stopped momentarily, and then resumed about ten seconds later. From the window of his flat, the witness could see the Victim lying on the floor of the void deck with \u201cblood all over the upper part of her body\u201d, and the Accused sitting on her body and hitting her.",
      "24": "The Defence submitted that the location of the offence was \u201cnot a usual place of public entertainment\u201d. This submission missed the point. It was not the nature or characterisation of the place itself that was aggravating; it was the fact that members of the public had been alarmed and the peace of the neighbourhood had been disturbed. In this regard, Chao Hick Tin JA stated as follows in PP v Ong Chee Heng [2017] 5 SLR 876 at [45]:",
      "25": "I agreed with the view expressed. In the present case, it was true that fortunately no one else was in an immediate danger of bodily harm except perhaps the Victim\u2019s father, who was not initially present but later rushed down to the scene upon hearing the Victim\u2019s cries for help and pushed the Accused away from her (see Judgment at [42]). However, that did not wholly negate the aggravating aspect of this factor. Indeed, public disquiet was not only a potentiality here; it was a fact supported by the evidence. The Defence\u2019s attempt to characterise the unrelated witnesses as \u201ccurious onlookers\u201d was an understatement. If it was all indeed pure curiosity, why would there have been 15 reports to the police?",
      "26": "In this regard, I also could not accept the Defence\u2019s submission that no aggravating weight should attach to this factor because the location was \u201cjust fortuitous\u201d. As a matter of fact, even though there was no evidence that the Accused had intended to cause public disquiet, it was the Accused himself who had chosen to confront the Victim at the void deck of the Block. This was not a chance encounter or a reverse situation where the Victim had confronted the Accused.",
      "27": "As for the offence-specific mitigating factors, I had found in the Judgment ([2] supra) at [304]\u2013[321] that there was no provocation from the Victim amounting to the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation within the meaning of Exception 1 to s 300 of the PC. I accepted that there was some relationship between the Accused and the Victim in which it could be said that she had led him on somewhat. This the Victim did not deny and in fact candidly admitted to (see Judgment at [15]). However, even if this could in law be mitigating, I did not consider this to be a mitigating factor on the facts. The Victim had made it clear to the Accused that she was ending their relationship sometime before the assault on 20 December 2013. Further, I had expressed doubts in the Judgment at [308]\u2013[319] as to whether, immediately prior to the offence, the Accused had in fact taken the Victim\u2019s handphone from her hand and seen the allegedly provocative wallpaper of the Victim and another man as he claimed. In this context, I was of the view that no conduct on the part of the Victim and nothing in the nature of their relationship could mitigate the Accused\u2019s culpability or the seriousness of the offence.",
      "28": "In so far as the Defence appeared to be suggesting that the \u201cfrenzied\u201d attack by the Accused meant that he had acted in a moment of passion which should \u201cameliorat[e] the harshness of the sentence\u201d, I also did not accept this as a mitigating factor. Even taking the Defence\u2019s argument at face value, it ran against the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in PP v BDB [2018] 1 SLR 127 which held that, as a general rule, the commission of an offence out of anger or strong emotions is not mitigating as the law expects one to be in control of his emotions and conduct even in moments of grave anger.",
      "29": "In the circumstances, I considered that there were the following offence-specific aggravating factors and no offence-specific mitigating factors:\n(a)     the Victim suffered extensive injuries, some of which were life-threatening and/or permanent;\n(b)     the Accused had harboured an intention to kill the Victim at the material time;\n(c)     the Accused had committed the offence using a deadly weapon;\n(d)     the Accused had struck at the Victim repeatedly, relentlessly, and forcefully in a particularly violent and vicious manner;\n(e)     the Accused had to some extent pre-planned the assault on the Victim; and\n(f)     the offence had caused public disquiet.",
      "30": "In relation to the offender-specific sentencing factors, no aggravating factors were identified by the parties and none was apparent to the court.",
      "31": "As for the mitigating factors, the Defence submitted that the Accused\u2019s lack of antecedents and good character were \u201cmitigating\u201d. The Prosecution did not challenge this point. It appeared that the courts\u2019 approach to the effect on sentence of an absence of antecedents had not been entirely consistent (see Benny Tan, \u201cAn Offender\u2019s Lack of Antecedents: A Closer Look at its Role in Sentencing\u201d, Singapore Law Gazette (May 2015)). This may require closer examination on another occasion. In the present case, whether or not the absence of antecedents could itself be considered mitigating, I did not think much credit could be given to the Accused given my finding that there had been some degree of pre-planning in relation to the offence. The Accused thus could not claim to have acted merely in a momentary lapse in judgment. The fact that the Accused\u2019s employer had described him as having \u201cgood character\u201d must also be taken in context: she was testifying as to the Accused\u2019s punctuality and satisfactory work performance (see Judgment at [158] and [234]). These were not relevant factors to be accounted for in sentencing in the present case.",
      "32": "The Defence also stressed that the Accused was remorseful. I accepted that, factually, the Accused had cried after the assault and had consistently stated in his police statements that he was apologetic. However, it is trite that \u201cremorse\u201d is only mitigating if it is motivated by genuine contriteness or regret. In this case, the Accused had to some extent pre-planned the assault, was caught red-handed, faced an overwhelming amount of evidence against him, and did not plead guilty (which was not an aggravating factor but meant that he could not use the guilty plea as evidence of his remorse). In these circumstances, no weight could be given to his apparent expressions of remorse.",
      "33": "Other factors raised by the Defence included the dishonour that the Accused\u2019s parents would suffer in their hometown and the hardship that would be caused to his family members who were financially dependent on him. While the court was not unsympathetic to these concerns, they did not constitute mitigating factors.",
      "34": "The likelihood that the Accused would be repatriated upon his release from prison was a factor I considered in holistically determining whether the sentence needed to be enhanced on account of specific deterrence (see [10] above), but this did not constitute an independent mitigating factor. Whether the Accused would be repatriated or not was an extra-judicial decision which bore no relation to the Accused\u2019s culpability or the harm that the Victim suffered. Neither principle nor precedent supported giving the Accused specific credit for this.",
      "35": "In the circumstances, I was of the view that there was no operative offender-specific factor in the present case, whether of an aggravating or mitigating nature.",
      "36": "Having identified the operative sentencing factors, I turn now to the precedents. In this regard, the Prosecution relied on Ravindran ([4] supra) while the Defence cited Seng Inn Thye ([5] supra). I will discuss them in turn.",
      "37": "Ravindran was a recent decision of the High Court involving the physical and sexual abuse by the offender of a victim who worked as a domestic helper in a neighbouring flat. The brief facts were as follows. The offender switched off the circuit box of the neighbouring flat to lure the victim out of her house. After briefly conversing with the victim, the offender pushed her into the flat and raped her. After the rape, the victim broke free and tried to escape, but she was caught by the offender and raped for the second time. Thereafter, the offender attempted to kill the victim by strangling her with his hands and a raffia string. The offender only stopped when the victim fell unconscious. As a result of the strangulation, the victim suffered bruises and abrasions on her neck, a haemorrhage in the sclera of the right eye, and medial congestion of the left eye. The force of strangulation was so strong that the victim suffered urinary incontinence.",
      "38": "The offender claimed trial to the five charges brought against him, being two counts of rape, one count of attempted murder, one count of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means, and one count of house-trespass with preparation to assault. Chan Seng Onn J convicted the offender on all five charges and sentenced him to an aggregate term of 27 years\u2019 imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. In relation to the sentence for the offence of attempted murder, Chan J sentenced the offender to 12 years\u2019 imprisonment and six strokes of the cane (at [75]):",
      "39": "I should note at the outset that at the time of my decision, Ravindran was apparently the only case involving attempted murder under s 307(1) of the PC since the amendment of the provision in 2007. I will explain the relevant statutory amendments later (see [45]\u2013[48] below).",
      "40": "In my view, there were two main distinguishing factors between Ravindran and the present case. One, the extent of the injuries in the present case was significantly greater in number and severity. Indeed, some of the Victim\u2019s injuries were permanent and could not be concealed. There was no evidence of harm of such a nature or degree in Ravindran. Two, the element of public disquiet caused in the present case at the time of the offence was not operative in Ravindran.",
      "41": "These factors warranted a heavier sentence in the present case than that imposed in Ravindran ([4] supra).",
      "42": "I turn now to Seng Inn Thye ([5] supra) on which the Defence relied. Here, the offender had taken a fruit knife to confront his ex-wife. The ex-wife said \u201cif you want to kill me, you can kill me\u201d and \u201ccome, come\u201d. The offender then stabbed the ex-wife a total of 14 times. Although most of the wounds were superficial, one of them was \u201cpotentially life threatening\u201d. The ex-wife was hospitalised for eight days. The offender was found to be remorseful. He surrendered himself and was diagnosed by a psychiatrist of the Woodbridge Hospital to be suffering from a \u201crecurrent depressive disorder\u201d.",
      "43": "The offender pleaded guilty to one count of attempted murder. Choo Han Teck J sentenced him to five years\u2019 imprisonment and four strokes of the cane, taking into account (a) the severity of the assault and the pain and danger he had put the ex-wife through, (b) his \u201cstruggle against his mental illness\u201d, (c) that he may not have committed the offence \u201cin a cooler hour\u201d, (d) that he did not plan to stalk her with the intention of killing her, and (e) his hitherto unblemished record.",
      "44": "The Defence relied on this case as an analogous precedent. I did not agree. At the outset, I noted that Seng Inn Thye was decided in April 2003. At that time, s 307 had not yet been amended to its current version and the statutory sentencing range was materially different:",
      "45": "In relation to attempted murder causing hurt (as opposed to attempted murder simpliciter), the pre-2007 statutory sentencing range under s 307(1) was mandatory imprisonment for life or up to ten years, and liability for caning. After a comprehensive review of the Penal Code in 2007, s 307(1) was amended by the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007 (Act 51 of 2007) to provide for a statutory sentencing range of mandatory imprisonment for life or up to 20 years, and liability for caning and/or fine (see [6] above). In so far as the imprisonment term, apart from imprisonment for life, was concerned, the maximum statutory sentence was doubled.",
      "46": "I pause to note that although the decision in Seng Inn Thye did not itself clarify, the charge there was presumably brought for attempted murder causing hurt, rather than attempted murder simpliciter, since caning was in fact imposed by the High Court.",
      "47": "In my view, the 2007 legislative change to s 307(1) was a significant development. In this regard, I agreed with the views expressed by Chao Hick Tin JA in the High Court decision in Keeping Mark John v PP [2017] 5 SLR 627 at [28]:",
      "48": "In relation to s 307(1), there was no known contrary Parliamentary intention that, assuming all else remained equal, this increase in the maximum statutory sentence should not be given effect to by generally heavier sentences imposed by the courts.",
      "49": "Furthermore, quite apart from the legislative amendment, the present facts were significantly more serious than those in Seng Inn Thye ([5] supra). First, it appeared that the offender in Seng Inn Thye had reacted spontaneously to the ex-wife\u2019s taunts. In the present case, the Victim did not taunt the Accused and there was in fact some pre-planning by him (see [21] above). Second, there was no mention of any public disquiet caused by the offending conduct in Seng Inn Thye. Third, the ex-wife did not appear to have suffered as extensive or serious injuries as the Victim. Fourth, the offender in Seng Inn Thye pleaded guilty. Fifth, the court had found that the offender there suffered from a \u201crecurrent depressive disorder\u201d, whereas in the present case I had found that the Accused did not suffer from any major psychiatric condition at the material time (see Judgment ([2] supra) at [266]).",
      "50": "Accordingly, taking into account the legislative change to s 307(1) and the distinguishing factors, I was of the view that the term of imprisonment for the Accused should be significantly longer than the five-year sentence imposed in Seng Inn Thye.",
      "51": "As for the number of strokes of the cane, six strokes were imposed in Ravindran ([4] supra) and four strokes in Seng Inn Thye. It was clear to me that in view of the nature of the offence and the aggravating factors, the submission of two strokes by the Defence was too lenient whereas the submission of six strokes by the Prosecution was appropriate and not excessive.",
      "52": "In the circumstances, after considering both precedents, I was of the view that a sentence of 14 years\u2019 imprisonment and six strokes of the cane was appropriate.",
      "53": "In its further submissions, the Prosecution proposed a sentencing framework in relation to the offence of attempted murder under s 307(1) of the PC. It submitted that the court should take note of the maximum statutory penalty and apply its mind to the question of where within the spectrum of punishment devised by Parliament the particular offender\u2019s conduct falls. Further, the court should also have regard to two parameters in determining the seriousness of the crime: the degree of harm caused, and the offender\u2019s culpability. Applying these principles, the Prosecution urged the following sentencing framework:",
      "54": "The Defence made no submissions on the Prosecution\u2019s proposed framework.",
      "55": "I was of the view that it was not desirable at this stage for a single judge sitting as a court of first instance to come to a concluded view as to the appropriate sentencing framework for all attempted murder cases going forward. In addition, I noted the following:\n(a)     Attempted murder cases are factually highly diverse. Unlike other violent crimes, the offence of attempted murder can be committed even in situations where little, if any, harm was caused (see, eg, illustration (d) to s 307(1)). The offender\u2019s culpability may also drastically differ depending on the steps that he had taken and the reasons why the victim was not killed.\n(b)     As the Prosecution itself noted, there was a less than substantial body of jurisprudence on offences committed under s 307(1). Indeed, it appeared that there had only been one decided case under s 307(1) of the PC since the 2007 Penal Code amendments. Nuances in sentences and sentencing considerations may thus not have been as well elucidated as compared to some of the other offences.\n(c)     Furthermore, it was not apparent whether the framework was applicable only to the second limb of s 307(1), or to both the first and the second limbs. If the former, the Prosecution would have to explain how the framework compared to the statutory sentencing range for the first limb as to sufficiently but fairly distinguish between attempted murder cases with and without hurt caused; if the latter, then the Prosecution should clarify how its sentencing framework would account for the two-tiered statutory structure of s 307(1). The relevance of s 307(2), and the option of caning, may also have to be accounted for in the framework. These aspects of the proposed sentencing framework could be refined.\n(d)     Importantly, as would be evident from the tabulated framework above, the Prosecution chose to adopt a uniform \u201cat least X years\u201d expression to describe the indicative sentencing ranges for each function in the harm-culpability matrix. This expression meant that there was no upper limit to the indicative sentencing ranges. This was a curious departure from the usual form of sentencing ranges laid down in cases adopting a similar harm-culpability matrix such as Logachev ([13] supra). While the Prosecution\u2019s approach might not be unjustifiable, it would have an impact on the way the courts identify a starting point within the indicative sentencing range (which was, on the Prosecution\u2019s proposed framework, boundless in its upper end) and take into account the operative offender-specific factors. These difficulties were also not thoroughly explored.",
      "56": "For the foregoing reasons, I sentenced the Accused in respect of the Charge to 14 years\u2019 imprisonment, which was to commence from 21 December 2013 as the date from which he was remanded, and six strokes of the cane."

      "1": "These appeals arose from the decision of the High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) in convicting the appellant (\u201cthe accused\u201d) of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 299, punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). It is, however, material to highlight that the accused was charged and convicted for committing an act by which death was caused with the intention of causing the victim\u2019s death \u2013 the most serious form of mens rea under s 299. The accused was, however, not sentenced to the maximum sentence of life imprisonment under s 304(a). He was instead sentenced to 18 years\u2019 imprisonment.",
      "2": "Several interesting issues have emerged from the appeals. This judgment will examine the treatment of the three different levels of mens rea under s 299 and how each of them would impact on the eventual sentence under s 304. In doing so, we will bear in mind that there are aspects of s 299 which are co-extensive with the offence of murder under s 300(a) and how the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to proceed with a charge under s 299 instead of s 300(a) can impact the Prosecution\u2019s burden in seeking for life imprisonment in relation to an act by which death was caused with the intention to cause the victim\u2019s death. Finally, we will also address the Prosecution\u2019s case that the default position for a conviction under s 304(a) should be life imprisonment and if this is not accepted, indicate when such a sentence would be warranted.",
      "3": "The accused was a family friend of the victim, Mdm Kanne Lactmy. He had come to know the victim through her sons. The victim\u2019s younger son, Sivakumar s/o Chinapan (\u201cMr Sivakumar\u201d), testified below that his elder brother had previously employed the accused.",
      "4": "The victim lived in a flat in Yishun with Mr Sivakumar and his family. On 9 December 2013, the day when she was killed by the accused, Mr Sivakumar and his family were away on holiday; she was all alone in the flat.",
      "5": "The accused lived with his wife, Parameswary A/P Thimparayan (\u201cMdm Parameswary\u201d), in a rented room in a flat in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. On the day of the offence, the accused had asked Mdm Parameswary about the payment schedule for their new flat in Johor Bahru. The accused told her that he would try to convince his employer to lend them some money. He also told her that he would be collecting $2,000 in tontine money that day. With that, he left home at 6.30am. He returned later that afternoon around 1.00pm to 2.00pm. What happened in the interim would have been beyond Mdm Parameswary\u2019s contemplation.",
      "6": "The accused had gone to the victim\u2019s flat in Yishun. He wanted to borrow money from either Mr Sivakumar or the victim. When he reached the flat, the victim invited him in. She offered to make him some coffee. As he was having his coffee, the accused told the victim that he needed to borrow $2,000 to $3,000 to pay the deposit for his new flat. The victim replied that she did not have that much money. The victim then went to the toilet to brush her teeth. While she was there, the accused searched each of the three rooms in the flat for valuables. He found nothing in the first two rooms. He then entered the master bedroom. He forced open the locked cupboard door and found a box containing jewellery. He decided to steal the box of jewellery.",
      "7": "As he was holding the box, the victim entered the master bedroom. The accused placed the box on the bed. He pleaded with the victim to let him keep the jewellery. He promised to repay her the money in instalments. The victim refused. She threatened to call Mr Sivakumar. He pleaded with her not to do so. The victim came closer to him. That was when matters took an unfortunate turn.",
      "8": "The accused shoved the victim hard. She fell onto the floor. He knelt down over her; she struggled and pleaded with him to let her go. He grabbed a pillow lying nearby and covered her face with it. With his left hand, he grabbed her neck at the same time. After about three to four minutes, he released his left hand, as he felt tired. He continued pressing the pillow down on her face. The victim struggled throughout the entire ordeal, which lasted for about ten minutes. The accused only removed the pillow at the end of those ten minutes or so when he noticed that the victim was no longer struggling. He threw the pillow onto the bed. At this moment, he noticed that the victim was gasping for air, eyes open. He took the box of jewellery and left the flat.",
      "9": "When he arrived back in Johor Bahru that day, the accused called Mdm Parameswary and told her that he had collected $2,000 from his employer and another $2,000 in tontine money. He also bought jewellery for her. Over the next few days, he gave his wife various sums of money as well, including RM5,000 to pay the deposit for the new flat.",
      "10": "On 17 December 2013, the couple had a heated argument. Mdm Parameswary insisted on going to Singapore to verify with the accused\u2019s employer that he had really taken a loan. While they were at the Woodlands immigration checkpoint, the accused was placed under arrest.",
      "11": "The accused claimed trial to the following charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, an offence under s 299, punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code:",
      "12": "However, the accused did not deny that he caused the victim\u2019s death. His sole defence at the trial was that he only had the knowledge that he was likely by his act to cause the victim\u2019s death, and that he should therefore be found guilty of a lesser offence within s 299, punishable under s 304(b) of the Penal Code which attracts a sentence of up to ten years\u2019 imprisonment.",
      "13": "At the end of the trial, the accused was convicted on the charge, ie, under s 304(a) of the Penal Code, for having had the intention to cause the victim\u2019s death. He was then sentenced to 18 years\u2019 imprisonment with effect from 17 December 2013, the date he was placed in remand. Since he was more than 50 years old at the time of sentencing, he could not be caned, by virtue of s 325(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). The Judge saw no reason to impose an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning given the substantial length of imprisonment already imposed. The accused appeals against the Judge\u2019s decision on conviction and sentence, while the Prosecution appeals against the Judge\u2019s decision on sentence.",
      "14": "The only issue in the accused\u2019s appeal against conviction is whether the Judge had erred in finding on the evidence that he had acted with an intention to kill the victim. As there is no denial that the accused caused the victim\u2019s death, it is apparent to us that the underlying purpose behind the accused\u2019s appeal against conviction is not to seek an acquittal altogether but ultimately a reduction in the sentence.",
      "15": "On the assumption that the conviction stands, the issue in the two appeals against sentence is whether the Judge erred in imposing an 18-year imprisonment term on the accused. The Prosecution contends that the gravity of the crime justified a term of life imprisonment; the accused contends that even on a conviction under s 304(a) of the Penal Code, the circumstances of this case only warranted a 12-year imprisonment term.",
      "16": "There are three types of mens rea elements under s 299 of the Penal Code for culpable homicide:\n(a)     first, where the act by which death is caused is done \u201cwith the intention of causing death\u201d (\u201cthe first limb\u201d);\n(b)     second, where the act by which death is caused is done \u201cwith the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death\u201d (\u201cthe second limb\u201d); and\n(c)     third, where the act by which death is caused is done \u201cwith the knowledge that [one] is likely by such act to cause death\u201d (\u201cthe third limb\u201d).",
      "17": "Section 304, which is the punishment provision for the offence of culpable homicide, provides for a range of punishments where the accused was convicted on the first and second limbs, and for another range of punishments where the accused was convicted on the third limb:",
      "18": "The legal principles on the ascertainment of an accused\u2019s intention under the first limb are uncontroversial; the inquiry under the first limb is fully subjective: PP v Sutherson, Sujay Solomon [2016] 1 SLR 632 (\u201cSutherson\u201d) at [46(a)]; Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan & Chan Wing Cheong, Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2018) (\u201cYeo, Morgan and Chan\u201d) at para 9.28. Yet, since it is nigh on impossible for a court to tap into the minds of accused persons, it is trite that \u201c[i]ntention is ... pre-eminently a matter for inference\u201d: Tan Joo Cheng v PP [1992] 1 SLR(R) 219 at [12]. The court will ordinarily take into account all relevant and admissible factors that bear upon the accused\u2019s intention, such as the individual characteristics of the accused as well as the objective surrounding circumstances of the crime, including the manner in which the crime was committed, the nature of the acts, the type of weapon used (if any), the location and number of injuries inflicted on the victim, and the way the injuries were inflicted: see Yeo, Morgan and Chan at para 9.30.",
      "19": "The relevant findings of the forensic pathologist, Dr Marian Wang, are summarised by the Judge at [26]\u2013[32] of the Judge\u2019s grounds of decision (PP v P Mageswaran [2017] SGHC 307 (\u201cthe GD\u201d)). We propose only to emphasise a few crucial aspects of that evidence.",
      "20": "First, the bruises found were spread out on the victim\u2019s neck as well as her jawline.",
      "21": "Second, there were significant internal neck injuries including fractures of the hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage, as well as haemorrhaging of the internal neck muscles, tissue surrounding the left vagus nerve and the thyroid gland.",
      "22": "Third, there were two principal mechanisms that had caused the victim\u2019s death by manual strangulation \u2013 compression of the blood vessels and compression of the airway. The former was evidenced by the subconjunctival haemorrhage or petechial haemorrhage in the victim\u2019s eyes, which was usually due to the compression of the blood vessels in the neck resulting in back-damming of the blood from the face. The latter mechanism was evidenced by the fractures of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage. These are bony structures that are not directly beneath the skin, but are buried deep within the throat beneath multiple layers of muscles. Fracturing these structures would require, in Dr Wang\u2019s opinion, \u201csignificant or severe force\u201d.",
      "23": "The Judge rejected the accused\u2019s submission that he only had the knowledge that his acts were likely to cause death, ie, his acts fell within the third limb. Instead, the Judge found that the first limb applied because the accused had in fact intended to cause the death of the victim, and convicted him accordingly. The Judge\u2019s finding on this point was based on three principal factors:\n(a)     First, the nature of the accused\u2019s acts: The accused had not only strangled the victim; he had also suffocated her with a pillow. The implication of this two-pronged approach was that it was likely to have a fatal outcome than if the accused had merely relied on either strangulation or suffocation alone. Dr Wang testified that manual strangulation alone would cause death if the brain were to be deprived of oxygen for about four to five minutes. But if strangulation were to be coupled with suffocation, oxygen would be prevented from getting to the lungs through the nose and mouth in addition to the compression of the neck, which would mean that death would \u201coccur faster\u201d.\n(b)     Second, the duration of the accused\u2019s acts: In his statements, the accused said that he had strangled the victim for three to four minutes, all the while suffocating her. After he stopped strangling the victim, he continued suffocating her, such that the victim was suffocated for a total of ten minutes. Although these were estimates, they were nonetheless considerable periods of time. At the trial, the accused did not dispute the timings he had provided in his statements.\n(c)     Third, the significant degree of force used: This was evidenced by the fractures of the victim\u2019s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage. Further, the accused had himself admitted that he was perspiring when he stopped suffocating the victim, which was testament to the amount of force he must have applied throughout the ten-minute period.",
      "24": "In our judgment, the Judge was correct to find that the accused had the intention of causing the victim\u2019s death.",
      "25": "In reaching this conclusion, we agree with the Judge\u2019s reasons for rejecting the accused\u2019s submission that he had in fact only grabbed the victim\u2019s jaw and pressed against it so as to stop the victim from shouting. We note that the accused did not in any of his statements recorded by the police mention that he had only held on to the victim\u2019s jaw. On the contrary, he stated quite unequivocally in his statements that he had used his left hand to grab the victim\u2019s neck, and had even made it clear at one point that he grabbed \u201cher neck below the jaw\u201d. The submission that he had only held on to the victim\u2019s jaw in an attempt to stop her from shouting only surfaced in the midst of the trial. This submission stemmed from two photographs of an ex post facto re-enactment of the offence, where the accused demonstrated what he did during the recording of his sixth statement on 23 December 2013 at 3.10pm. Counsel for the accused, Mr Derek Kang, submitted below and before us that the photographs clearly showed that the accused\u2019s left hand only made contact with the victim\u2019s jawline without touching her neck.",
      "26": "We do not think that much weight ought to be given to an after-the-fact re-enactment of the offence. This is not to say that re-enactments in general are unhelpful. But considering that this point never came up in any of the accused\u2019s statements and only surfaced very late in the midst of the trial, there is every reason for us to doubt its veracity. Moreover, in the light of all the surrounding evidence in this particular case, we do not think there is any merit in the submission that the accused only held on to the victim\u2019s jaw; the bruises found on the victim\u2019s neck and jaw put paid to that submission. If anything, those bruises indicated that, consistent with how a struggle would typically have unfolded, the accused\u2019s hand must have been positioned and re-positioned throughout as he attempted to hold on to the struggling victim\u2019s neck. Ultimately, the most damning evidence of all, as the Judge found, were the victim\u2019s internal neck injuries, in particular, the fractures of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage. Regardless of whether these fractures resulted from a prolonged period of force being exerted on the neck or from a momentary application of force to that part of the body, the point is that it would require \u201csignificant or severe force\u201d, in Dr Wang\u2019s words, to fracture these bony structures, as they were protected by layers of muscle.",
      "27": "In the circumstances, it is clear to us that the accused had intended to kill the victim. During the appeal hearing, we asked Mr Kang what else the accused could have intended in light of the facts. After all, on the accused\u2019s own case, he had strangled and suffocated the victim so as to silence her and to make a quick exit. It was not even his case that he had tried to incapacitate her temporarily. Indeed, on his own account of the facts, he never made an attempt to muffle the victim\u2019s calls for help using less lethal means; he went straight for the jugular, quite literally. The Judge had considered this and concluded, rightly in our judgment, that in the light of all of the accused\u2019s actions, the accused must have intended to silence the victim by killing her.",
      "28": "The accused also submitted that he did not have the intention to cause the victim\u2019s death because if he did, then he would not have left the flat after noticing that the victim was gasping for air with her eyes open. Instead, if he had intended to cause the victim\u2019s death, he would have \u201cfinished the job\u201d by killing the victim and ensuring that the victim no longer displayed any signs of life.",
      "29": "The Judge did not make a specific finding as to whether the victim had in fact displayed signs of life just before the accused left the flat. Like the Judge, we are nonetheless prepared to accept the accused\u2019s case at its highest and assume that the accused had indeed observed some signs of life in the victim just before he made away with the box of jewellery. But even on that assumption, we agree with the Judge\u2019s finding that the accused had the intention to cause the victim\u2019s death. The inquiry is to ascertain from the objective conduct of the accused at the time when he was suffocating and strangling the victim whether he had the intention to cause her death. The mere fact that the accused did not take further steps to \u201cfinish off\u201d the victim, when she exhibited some signs of life after he stopped the suffocation and strangulation, does not per se create reasonable doubt that he therefore did not intend to cause her death at the relevant time. Here the suffocation and strangulation were over quite a long period of time. The accused only stopped after the victim became motionless. The inference is that the accused wanted to ensure that the victim would not live to identify him especially since she knew him. Indeed, this much was evident from his statement to the police recorded on 22 December 2013 at 1:10pm:",
      "30": "The accused also admitted on the stand that if the victim had remained alive, she would have been able to identify him:",
      "31": "We accordingly agree with the Judge that the accused had formed the relevant intention to kill the victim at the relevant time, and had acted on that intention in those fateful ten minutes on the morning of 9 December 2013.",
      "32": "Having upheld the accused\u2019s conviction under s 304(a) of the Penal Code, it remains for us to consider whether the 18-year imprisonment term the Judge imposed was warranted. The range of sentences under s 304(a) is provided for as follows:",
      "33": "The accused is ineligible for caning due to his age. The Judge decided that, given the substantial length of the imprisonment term, there was no reason to impose a further term of imprisonment in lieu of caning. The Prosecution does not pursue this point in its appeal against sentence. Instead, it submits that this was a case that called for the imposition of a term of life imprisonment, as it was one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304. For reasons that we will explain below, this was an onerous burden that could have been avoided by the Prosecution. Based on the charging decision, to achieve the sentence it now seeks, it is incumbent on the Prosecution to persuade the court that the maximum prescribed sentence under s 304(a) ought to be imposed. Ultimately, we are not so persuaded for the reasons which we explain below.",
      "34": "We begin with a consideration of the relationship between the offences of culpable homicide and murder. Section 299 of the Penal Code lays out the definition of the offence of culpable homicide, while s 300 describes when the offence of culpable homicide becomes the offence of murder:",
      "35": "In Sutherson ([18] supra), the High Court examined the relationship between both s 299 and s 300. We reproduce the relevant portions of that judgment (at [46]\u2013[47]):",
      "36": "The first point to note from the extract reproduced above is that murder is a species or subset of the offence of culpable homicide: see Yeo, Morgan and Chan at para 9.24. It follows that there are distinct forms of culpable homicide that do not amount to murder. In this regard, the Malaysian Federal Court of Criminal Appeal in Tham Kai Yau v PP [1977] 1 MLJ 174 (at 176G\u2013176I) stated that there are two situations in which culpable homicide not amounting to murder may be made out: (a) where the elements of the offence of murder have been proved, but one or more exceptions provided under s 300 apply; or (b) where the necessary degree of mens rea in s 299 has been proved, but not the special degree of mens rea in s 300 (ie, the mens rea requirements under ss 300(b) to 300(d)): see Sutherson at [45]; Yeo, Morgan and Chan at para 9.24.",
      "37": "The other point we note from Sutherson (at [46(a)]) is that the ingredients of the crime under the first limb of s 299 are exactly the same as the ingredients of the crime under s 300(a): see Yeo, Morgan and Chan at para 8.57. This is significant because although the ingredients are the same, the penalties they attract are vastly different. As referenced at [30] above, a conviction on the first limb of the culpable homicide offence attracts, under s 304(a), a maximum sentence of life imprisonment or imprisonment for a term that may extend to 20 years. However, a conviction under s 302(1), which is the punishment provision for the same conduct under s 300(a), attracts the mandatory death penalty:",
      "38": "Of course, where one or more of the exceptions under s 300 applies, a conviction for murder under s 302(1) can be reduced to culpable homicide under the first limb. But because s 299 itself creates a substantive offence, \u201cit is open to the prosecution to charge the accused under s 299 even where they intended to kill, and there may not be any partial defences open to the accused\u201d: Yeo, Morgan and Chan at para 8.57. Indeed, Yeo, Morgan and Chan went on to say (at para 8.57) that \u201c[t]here are at least two recent Singapore cases where this has happened\u201d (ie, where the Prosecution has charged the accused under the first limb of s 299 instead of s 300(a) even though no relevant exceptions under s 300 applied). The two cases cited are Dewi Sukowati v PP [2017] 1 SLR 450 (\u201cDewi Sukowati\u201d) and the present case.",
      "39": "This anomalous situation, where the same ingredients give rise to two different offences attracting different penalties, and where an offender may either be facing the mandatory death penalty or a term of imprisonment depending on what charge the Prosecution prefers, \u201cenhances the importance of prosecutorial decisions and may promote plea negotiation\u201d: Yeo, Morgan and Chan at para 8.56. In a case like the present though, which for starters does not engage any of the exceptions under s 300, and where it is not apparent to us whether there has been any form of plea bargaining, the Prosecution\u2019s decision to prefer a charge under the first limb of the culpable homicide offence instead of under s 300(a) can only lead to one irresistible inference \u2013 having weighed all the relevant circumstances in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, the Prosecution has arrived at the view that the mandatory death penalty for the offence under s 300(a) might not be warranted in the circumstances of this case. We should make it clear that we are not in any way questioning the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in the present case. That is the Prosecution\u2019s prerogative. However, we do wish to state that any exercise of prosecutorial discretion would inevitably have an impact on the outcome and the eventual sentence. This would have been obvious to the Prosecution.",
      "40": "The decision as to what charge to bring against an accused is entirely within the realm of prosecutorial discretion, and is based on a whole host of factors, including what the Prosecution would have thought the accused deserved in the circumstances, as well as what offence the Prosecution itself would have felt confident of being able to prove on the facts. This was accepted by the Prosecution.",
      "41": "Having obtained the conviction under the first limb of the culpable homicide offence, the Prosecution now seeks to secure the maximum sentence of life imprisonment by showing that the present case is one of the worst type of cases under s 299, punishable under s 304. But, as we have indicated, this is a burden that the Prosecution could well have avoided from the outset in its examination of the various charging options. For if the Prosecution\u2019s position is that the present case does not justify the imposition of the death penalty, but is still sufficiently grave to warrant the imposition of life imprisonment, then it may be more sensible to bring a charge under one of the provisions in ss 300(b) to 300(d) punishable under s 302(2). Once it obtains a conviction under one of the provisions in ss 300(b) to 300(d), the Prosecution can then seek to persuade the sentencing court to exercise its discretion and impose life imprisonment instead of the death penalty. Indeed, this is precisely the rationale for the 2012 amendments to the Penal Code, which, by removing the mandatory death penalty for the offences under ss 300(b) to 300(d) punishable under s 302(2), sought \u201cto introduce more judicial discretion in deciding whether the death sentence ought to be imposed for murder\u201d: Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (14 November 2012) vol 89 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law). Having said this, we reiterate that it is the prerogative of the Prosecution to frame the charge as it deems fit based on a multitude of factors. However, whatever charge the Prosecution eventually elects to frame, it must be cognisant of the requisite burden in relation to sentencing which accompanies a conviction on the charge.",
      "42": "Adopting such an approach would obviate the onerous burden on the Prosecution to press for the maximum sentence of life imprisonment for a conviction under s 299 punishable under s 304(a). If the Prosecution was of the view that the facts of the case are sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt a charge on the first limb of the culpable homicide offence (and by corollary, s 300(a) as well), then a fortiori it would have likely taken the view that the facts would also be sufficient to establish at least one if not all of the other offences punishable under s 302(2) (ie, ss 300(b) to 300(d)). This follows from the fact that an \u201cintention of causing death\u201d within the meaning of both s 299 and s 300(a) is the gravest and most severe form of mens rea not just amongst the different mens rea elements under s 300, but also amongst the mens rea elements of all the offences in Singapore\u2019s statute books. As is clear from the parliamentary debates in the lead up to the 2012 amendments to the Penal Code, the view was that the mens rea under s 300(a) is the most serious and therefore justified the retention of the mandatory death penalty in respect of that offence (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (9 July 2012) vol 89 at pp 266\u2013267 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)):",
      "43": "It follows therefore, that the mens rea requirement under the first limb of s 299 likewise concerns the most serious state of mind even when compared with the mens rea requirements under ss 300(b) to 300(d), since the mens rea requirements under the first limb of s 299 and under s 300(a) map onto each other and are co-extensive: Sutherson ([18] supra) at [46(a)] (see [33] above). Logically therefore, establishing the first limb of s 299 would entail proof of the highest threshold of mental intention in comparison with the provisions in ss 300(b) to 300(d). In most cases, proof of the highest threshold (ie, intention to cause death) would typically satisfy one if not all of the other limbs under s 300 but the converse for obvious reasons is not true.",
      "44": "The decision of the High Court in PP v BPK [2018] SGHC 34 is a case in point. The accused there was charged with attempted murder under s 307(1) of the Penal Code. The charge stated that the accused had inflicted multiple stab and slash wounds on the victim\u2019s head, neck, chest, abdomen, back and arms with a knife measuring about 33cm. One issue in that case was whether any of the mens rea requirements of murder under ss 300(a) to 300(d) could be established on the facts to found a conviction for attempted murder. The trial judge found that the accused had the intention to cause death within the meaning of s 300(a). This was because the accused had struck repeatedly, relentlessly and forcefully at several parts of the victim\u2019s body, including vulnerable regions like the head and neck. He had also initiated the attack on the victim while she was standing, and continued to strike at her forcefully with the knife even after she had fallen to the ground (at [290]). Pertinently, the trial judge added (at [301]) that based on the nature and number of the victim\u2019s injuries and the manner of the accused\u2019s attack, even if he was wrong on his conclusion that the accused had the intention to cause death, he would nonetheless have found that the accused had, at the material time, formed and acted on the mens rea requirements under s 300(b) and s 300(d).",
      "45": "Further, although we acknowledge that the court ultimately retains a discretion to sentence an offender to death under s 302(2) notwithstanding the Prosecution\u2019s submission for life imprisonment, that \u2018risk\u2019, if one might term it that, is quite remote. In cases where the mandatory death penalty does not apply to the offence of murder, the death penalty is warranted only where the actions of the offender have outraged the feelings of the community: see PP v Kho Jabing [2015] 2 SLR 112 at [44], [86], [203]. That is a very stringent test. Indeed, even in respect of a conviction under s 302(2), this court has imposed life imprisonment notwithstanding the Prosecution\u2019s submission for the death penalty: see Michael Anak Garing v PP [2017] 1 SLR 748 at [61]\u2013[62]. Additionally, we are not aware of any case since the introduction of the 2012 amendments removing the mandatory death penalty for the offences under ss 300(b) to 300(d) where, despite the Prosecution\u2019s submission for life imprisonment in respect of a conviction under s 302(2), the court has imposed the death penalty instead.",
      "46": "In the instant case, despite the fact that none of the exceptions under s 300 applied, the Prosecution elected to frame a charge on the first limb of the culpable homicide offence against the accused, viz, that the act by which death was caused was committed \u201cwith the intention of causing death\u201d. The maximum sentence prescribed for that offence is a term of life imprisonment. The Prosecution\u2019s submission is that the maximum sentence is warranted since the instant case was one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. We have already expressed our view that the Prosecution could have achieved the sentence it now seeks if it had instead charged the accused under ss 300(b) to 300(d) and sought to persuade the court at the sentencing stage to exercise its discretion to impose the lower minimum sentence of life imprisonment. The eventual sentence that the Prosecution secured in the instant case (which it now regards as unsatisfactory) is in part a product of its own charging decision. This is not to say that life imprisonment is never justified where the Prosecution charges an accused person under the first limb of the culpable homicide offence and obtains a conviction on that basis. But to achieve that outcome, the Prosecution will have to demonstrate that the particular case in question is one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicide. That is, however, not an easy task to discharge.",
      "47": "In this regard, before we proceed further, we sound a note of caution, as we did in Dewi Sukowati ([36] supra at [18]), about reliance on cases prior to the 2008 amendment to s 304(a) in determining whether a term of life imprisonment is appropriate. Prior to the amendment, a sentencing judge could well have been faced with two imperfect options \u2013 a maximum imprisonment term of ten years, which may be insufficient, and a term of life imprisonment, which would be crushing. The courts no longer face this dilemma. Since s 304(a) was amended to increase the sentencing range to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment as an alternative to life imprisonment, greater flexibility in sentencing has been made available to the courts. Indeed, the new sentencing regime ensures that the option is open for courts to sentence \u201cthose who need to be imprisoned for a length of time between 10 and 20 years\u201d (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (22 October 2007) vol 83 (Christopher de Souza, Member of Parliament), without having to choose between a manifestly inadequate sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment or a manifestly excessive one of life imprisonment.",
      "48": "Generally, for any criminal offence in our statute books, when Parliament sets a statutory maximum on the sentence that can be imposed for that particular offence, it signals the gravity with which the public, through Parliament, views that particular offence: see Cheong Siat Fong v PP [2005] SGHC 176 at [23]; R v H (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 at 65. It therefore stands to reason that sentencing judges must take note of the maximum prescribed penalty and then apply their minds to determine precisely where the offender\u2019s conduct falls within the spectrum of punishment devised by Parliament: Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 at [84]. In this regard, the maximum sentence \u201cis not reserved for the worst offence of the kind dealt with it that can be imagined\u201d; instead, the maximum sentence \u201cshould be reserved for the worst type of cases falling within the prohibition\u201d [emphasis added in bold italics]: Bensegger v R [1979] WAR 65 (per Burt CJ), cited with approval by Yong Pung How CJ in Sim Gek Yong v PP [1995] 1 SLR(R) 185 (\u201cSim Gek Yong\u201d) at [12]. What this entails as a matter of practice is the following (see Sim Gek Yong at [13]):",
      "49": "In our view, Yong CJ\u2019s exhortation to examine: (a) the nature of the crime, and (b) the circumstances of the criminal, provides a useful starting point to examine the question whether a particular case is one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicide. Beyond this, it is quite impossible to lay down any more concrete guideline or rule as to when a case of culpable homicide becomes one of the worst type. This is very much for the same reason that the courts have generally shied away from laying down any sentencing benchmark for culpable homicide, viz, that the range of circumstances in which such offences are committed is extremely varied: PP v Tan Kei Loon Allan [1998] 3 SLR(R) 679 at [33], cited in Lim Ghim Peow v PP [2014] 4 SLR 1287 at [55], which in turn was cited in Dewi Sukowati at [15]. Suffice to say, it will almost invariably be the case that in examining the nature of the crime as well as the circumstances of the criminal, one may be able to identify certain mitigating circumstances, which would then render the case as not one of the worst type. To satisfy the criterion of being one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicide would generally entail an absence or at least a lack of material mitigating circumstances. Admittedly it might take a rare case for that criterion to be met. But as one learned commentator noted, \u201c[g]iven that the maximum sentence is reserved only for \u2018a range of conduct which characterizes the most serious instances of the offence in question\u2019, it is not surprising that such a sentence is seldom imposed\u201d: Kow Keng Siong, Sentencing Principles in Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2009) at para 05.019.",
      "50": "In Dewi Sukowati, the 18-year old accused was a domestic helper who had been chided and physically abused by her employer, the deceased. She lost control and struck the deceased, causing the deceased to lose consciousness but not to die. The accused did not know what to do initially but eventually decided to drown the deceased in the swimming pool so that the deceased would not be able to report the initial assault to the police. As the accused was dragging the deceased\u2019s body to the swimming pool, she slammed the deceased\u2019s head on the edge of a step and inflicted further injuries with a view to killing the deceased. The accused was convicted under s 304(a) and sentenced to a term of 18 years\u2019 imprisonment.",
      "51": "Upon close examination of the facts in Dewi Sukowati, it is clear to us that Dewi Sukowati was not one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicide, since there were mitigating factors at play. In relation to the nature of the crime, the level of premeditation was not as significant as in some other cases (at [22]). Further, there were several mitigating factors clustered around the accused\u2019s circumstances, chiefly, the provocation by the deceased, the accused\u2019s mental condition at the time of the offence and her youth (at [22]).",
      "52": "To sum up, in considering whether the maximum penalty of life imprisonment under s 304(a) is warranted, the sentencing court will have to be satisfied that the case before it is one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicides. We note, parenthetically, that life imprisonment is warranted, alternatively, where the Hodgson criteria are satisfied such that the court is of the view that the mentally unstable offender will pose a \u201cserious danger to the public for an indeterminate time\u201d: Sutherson ([18] supra) at [59]. But we are not concerned with the Hodgson criteria in this case. In determining whether a case is one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicides, the sentencing court will have to examine the circumstances of the case from the perspective of: (a) the nature of the crime; and (b) the circumstances of the criminal. It would take an exceptional case, devoid of any mitigating circumstances, for a sentencing court to be satisfied that a case is one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicides warranting the imposition of the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.",
      "53": "In our judgment, the instant case does not fall within that category. The relevant mitigating circumstances in this case clustered around the nature of the crime. The Judge found, and the Prosecution did not dispute, that the offence here was not premeditated. The accused had not gone to the victim\u2019s flat with the intention or plan of robbing and killing her. This is not to downplay the severity or gravity of the crime that eventually occurred; intentional killing is undoubtedly an act that has no place in any civilised society. But one has to adopt a measure of perspective in order to assess whether the killing in this particular case was indeed one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicide. It seems to us that this was not. The accused would probably have made away with the box of jewellery had the victim not caught him red-handed. Even when he was caught with the box of jewellery, the accused did not react violently in an instant; he actually pleaded with the victim to let him have it. Again, here, we must be clear that we are not victim-blaming. But in asking ourselves whether the accused deserved to be locked away for life for having committed one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicide, we have to take a step back to assess the facts. Having done so, we are persuaded that the present case was an unfortunate instance of a theft gone wrong as a result of a wretched confluence of circumstances.",
      "54": "We also reject the Prosecution\u2019s submission that a conviction on the first limb of the culpable homicide offence must result in a \u201cstarting position\u201d of life imprisonment, from which point one calibrates the sentence accordingly. In our view, the fact of conviction on the first limb cannot properly constitute an aggravating circumstance, although it is a relevant consideration. If Parliament had intended for the \u201cstarting position\u201d to be life imprisonment for convictions founded on the first limb, Parliament would have expressed that intention with appropriate language in the provision. Secondly, if the view is correct, as we think it is, that the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder is warranted only in the worst type of cases of that offence, then it makes no sense to say that a conviction on the first limb of that offence attracts as a \u201cstarting position\u201d the maximum penalty of life imprisonment, for the burden is on the Prosecution to show instead why the sentence ought to be calibrated upwards towards the maximum. Finally, it cannot be that Parliament would have intended for a conviction under the first limb of the culpable homicide offence to attract a \u201cstarting position\u201d of life imprisonment, especially since it specifically amended the punishment provision to prescribe a sentence of up to 20 years\u2019 or life imprisonment from the previous position of ten years\u2019 or life imprisonment so as to give the courts greater \u201cflexibility\u201d to sentence \u201cthose who need to be imprisoned for a length of time between 10 and 20 years\u201d (see [44] above).",
      "55": "We note that in imposing an 18-year imprisonment term, the Judge had relied, as a mitigating factor, on her finding that the accused suffered from executive deficits which caused him to act impulsively in deciding to kill the victim. In our judgment however, this point could not properly be relied upon because of the inadequacy of the evidence below. It seems to us that the label \u201cexecutive deficits\u201d was used below to describe a person \u2013 the accused in this case \u2013 who had problems of self-inhibition and decision-making. There was no evidence led to show that \u201cexecutive deficits\u201d themselves are a recognised condition or mental illness in the nature of, for example, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. Nor was the evidence led below conclusive that the accused\u2019s executive deficits, if he suffered from them, stemmed from a recognised mental condition. Instead, the label appears to have been used almost in its lay sense, to describe a person with problems of self-inhibition and decision-making, just like how one would perhaps describe a person as being \u201cslow\u201d or \u201cnot that smart\u201d. This is evident from the 24 October 2016 report of Dr Matthew Woo, a principal consultant clinical psychologist in practice at Adelphi Psych Medicine Clinic, who was called by the accused:",
      "56": "The importance of adducing evidence to show that the alleged executive deficits were a recognised mental condition, or arose from one, cannot be understated. This is because in determining the mitigating value to be attributed to an offender\u2019s mental condition, the court must first ask if the nature of the mental condition was such that the offender retained substantially the mental ability or capacity to control or restrain himself at the time of his criminal acts. If the answer was \u201cyes\u201d but the offender chose not to exercise self-control, the mental condition would be of little or no mitigating value: Chang Kar Meng v PP [2017] 2 SLR 68 at [33]. That an alleged mental condition is a recognised one, or one that arose from a recognised mental condition, although not determinative, lends credence nonetheless to the view that an offender who laboured under that condition did not or could not retain substantially the capacity to restrain himself at the time of his offending. This would accordingly lend mitigating value to the alleged mental condition.",
      "57": "This court\u2019s recent decision in PP v ASR [2019] 1 SLR 941 (\u201cASR\u201d) is a case in point. The accused in that case was afflicted with an intellectual disability. He was a student at a school for children with special needs, and was assessed by the Institute of Mental Health a few months after the commission of the offences to have an intelligence quotient of 61. This court also found on the medical evidence that the accused had a mental age of between eight and ten, even though he was 14 years of age when he committed the offences in question. The Prosecution accepted that the accused\u2019s executive deficits, which impaired his ability to control his impulses, stemmed from his intellectual disability. The issue of whether the accused retained substantially the capacity to restrain himself at the time of offending was therefore not in dispute. Nevertheless, this court went on to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to properly establish, as a fact, that the accused suffered from a lack of impulse control. It answered the question in the affirmative, because the medical evidence was unanimous in linking the accused\u2019s intellectual disability with his executive deficits and lack of impulse control. This consequently lent mitigating value to the accused\u2019s executive deficits.",
      "58": "In the case at hand, it was common ground that the accused had low intellectual ability but not to the extent that he was intellectually disabled like the accused in ASR. More crucially, the evidence below was inconclusive as to whether the accused\u2019s low intellectual ability, or any other mental condition for that matter, was a causal factor for his alleged executive deficits. Dr John Bosco Lee, who was also called by the accused, in his report identified the accused\u2019s frontal lobe dysfunction, low intellectual capacity and alcohol use disorder as causal factors of the accused\u2019s impulsivity and impaired executive functions. The Judge found that the accused\u2019s frontal lobe dysfunction was of no pathological significance (GD ([19] supra) at [80]). Dr Stephen Phang, the Prosecution\u2019s expert witness, on the other hand, gave evidence that even if the accused suffered from executive deficits, his low intellectual capacity and alcohol use disorder would not have contributed to his executive deficits.",
      "59": "The significance of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (\u201cWCST\u201d) administered on the accused by Dr Woo has to be assessed against the aforementioned evidential context. Dr Woo\u2019s assessment that the accused suffered from executive deficits was based entirely on the accused\u2019s poor performance on the WCST, a test that is designed to assess conceptual problem solving and mental flexibility. The WCST was administered on the accused only in October 2016 though, close to three years after the offence. Even assuming that his poor performance on the WCST in October 2016 can be attributed to his executive deficits, all that can be derived from the fact of his poor performance then is that he suffered from executive deficits in October 2016. In order for the conclusions from the accused\u2019s poor performance on the WCST in 2016 to be extrapolated accurately to the state of his mind or other executive functioning at the time of offending in 2013, the evidence must go further to demonstrate that there is an underlying causal factor for his executive deficits that has remained present all this while even during the time of his offence. Thus, just by way of an example, if the accused has low intellectual ability all this time, and the evidence shows that his low intellectual ability is the cause for his executive deficits, then one might be more prepared to conclude that he was labouring under executive deficits at the time of offending just as he was at the time when he took the WCST. But as we have noted, the evidence below on this point was inconclusive. Even Dr Woo seems to proffer a third view, which is that the accused\u2019s executive deficits were independent of his low intellectual capacity, and were only a result of the accused\u2019s alcohol use disorder and his frontal lobe dysfunction. We therefore hold that no proper conclusion about the accused\u2019s mental state at the time of offending can be drawn from the mere fact that the accused had fared poorly on the WCST administered by Dr Woo in October 2016.",
      "60": "In any case, notwithstanding our rejection of the Judge\u2019s finding that the accused was suffering from executive deficits at the relevant time, for the reasons set out above at [50]\u2013[51], we do not think that the sentence of 18 years\u2019 imprisonment was manifestly inadequate such that it should warrant life imprisonment instead. While a sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment may well have been more appropriate given our rejection of the accused\u2019s alleged executive deficits, it bears repeating that an appellate court should only intervene where the sentence imposed by the court below was \u201cmanifestly\u201d inadequate \u2013 that in itself implies a high threshold before intervention is warranted: PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [84]. In this regard, a sentence is only manifestly inadequate where it is \u201cunjustly lenient\u201d and \u201crequires substantial alterations rather than minute corrections to remedy the injustice\u201d: PP v Siew Boon Loong [2005] 1 SLR(R) 611 at [22]. We do not think that a difference of two years, in the context of the already substantial period of imprisonment imposed as well as the facts of this case, merits appellate intervention. This is perhaps in line with the Prosecution\u2019s appeal to substitute the sentence of 18 years\u2019 imprisonment with one of life imprisonment instead of an increase to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.",
      "61": "The accused submits that only a 12-year imprisonment term was warranted in the circumstances. We disagree. Although we have taken the view that this was a case of a robbery gone wrong, that has to be seen in the context of our rejection of the Prosecution\u2019s submission that this was one of the worst type of cases of culpable homicide. We should also add that this view does not change nor does it impact on our agreement with the Judge\u2019s factual finding that the accused had intended to cause the victim\u2019s death. In this regard, we agree generally with the Judge\u2019s reasons found at [113]\u2013[119] of the GD save for those in relation to the issue of executive deficits, ie, with regard to the accused\u2019s antecedents, his conviction under the first limb of s 299, the aggravating factors surrounding the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the accused and the relevant sentencing precedents, and we agree that an 18-year imprisonment term was warranted on the facts of this case. We see no reason to disturb the sentence imposed.",
      "62": "We accordingly dismiss both the Prosecution\u2019s appeal against sentence as well as the accused\u2019s appeal against conviction and sentence."

He found that a sum of money he had kept in his pockets the night before was missing and suspected that the victim, who worked for him and who he believed was the last to leave the lodging house that night, must have taken it. The appellant called the victim and asked him to come to the lodging house. When the latter arrived, the appellant accused him of stealing his money and proceeded to attack him with his bare hands and later with a metal dumbbell rod which he used to inflict several blows to the victim\u2019s head and body. The victim collapsed, bleeding profusely from the head. He was sent to a hospital after some hours, and he passed away there a week later.",
      "2": "The appellant was convicted in the High Court of one count of murder under s 300(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cthe PC\u201d) and sentenced to death under s 302(1) of the PC. He appeals against both the conviction and the sentence.",

      "4": "In the early hours of 14 January 2014, the appellant returned to his lodging house after gambling at a casino. He took some sleeping tablets and went to sleep. When he awoke at about 11.00am, he discovered that a sum of around $6,000, which he had kept in his pockets when he went to bed, was missing. The appellant\u2019s suspicions turned to the victim, who was working for him as a pimp and who, he recalled, had been the last to leave the lodging house the night before. The appellant called the victim and asked him to come to the lodging house.",
      "5": "When the victim arrived at the lodging house, he was confronted by the appellant but denied taking the money. This infuriated the appellant, who slapped the victim, and this in turn led to a fight that started in the living room and ended in one of the bedrooms (\u201cBedroom 1\u201d). At some point during the fight, the appellant took hold of a 40cm-long metal dumbbell rod weighing 1.46kg, with which he hit the victim several times on his head and body. About 15 minutes after the fight had started, the victim was left bleeding on the bed in Bedroom 1.",
      "6": "The appellant then called another member of his staff, Chua Thiam Hock (\u201cChua\u201d), and asked him to come to the lodging house. When he arrived, Chua was similarly accused of stealing the appellant\u2019s money and on denying it, he was attacked with the rod, which fractured his hands. The appellant ordered Chua to go into Bedroom 1 and see for himself what the consequences would be of stealing from him. In Chua\u2019s presence, the appellant then hit the victim with the rod again, save that he did not hit his head. Each time he was hit, the victim would groan faintly. The appellant then confined the victim and Chua in Bedroom 1 by securing the door with some rope.",
      "7": "The appellant was in the living room when he received a call from Aw Teck Huat (\u201cAw\u201d); a member of the Sio Gi Ho secret society of which both the appellant and the victim were members. The appellant told Aw that he had beaten up the victim for stealing his money.",

The appellant told Gan that he had beaten the victim severely for stealing his money, and showed Gan the rod he had used to attack the victim. The appellant then removed the rope securing the door to Bedroom 1 and opened the door. Upon seeing the victim\u2019s condition, Gan called another of the appellant\u2019s staff members, Tan Keok Ling (\u201cTan\u201d), and asked him to come to the lodging house.",
      "9": "Tan arrived at the lodging house at about 3.40pm. The appellant showed Tan the rod he had used on the victim, told Tan that he had beaten the victim for stealing his money, and asked Tan to look at him in Bedroom 1. Tan observed that the victim was unresponsive and breathing heavily.",
      "10": "The appellant then instructed Chua to fetch a pail of water to clean the blood off the victim\u2019s body. Chua, however, was unable to do so because of his fractured hands. The appellant then took a pail of water and splashed it on the victim, shouting vulgarities and accusing the victim of pretending to be dead.",
      "11": "When Tan admonished the appellant for hurting the victim so badly, the appellant was unremorseful and threatened to hit him again when he regained consciousness. Fearing that the appellant would carry out his threat, Tan called Aw hoping that he might prevail upon the appellant not to do so. Tan also told the appellant that an ambulance should be called given the seriousness of the victim\u2019s injuries but the appellant refused and threatened to beat up Tan if he were to do so. The appellant also instructed Gan to dispose of the rod.",
      "12": "At about 5.00pm, Koh Tzer Jiiun (\u201cKoh\u201d), another member of the Sio Gi Ho secret society, who had been called by Aw arrived at the lodging house. He checked on the victim and found him unresponsive and breathing heavily. Koh informed Aw of this and also told him that the victim was in a terrible state such that an ambulance should be called. Aw then called his friend Tan Teng Huat (\u201cT H Tan\u201d) and asked him to bring the victim to the hospital.",
      "13": "When T H Tan arrived at the lodging house, the appellant refused to allow him to bring the victim to the hospital. The appellant told T H Tan that he had beaten the victim for stealing his money, and offered to let T H Tan see him. T H Tan declined and instead called a private ambulance service. When he learnt that a private ambulance was on its way, the appellant instructed Chua and Tan to carry the victim to the front porch of the lodging house to await the private ambulance.",
      "14": "When the paramedic in charge of the ambulance saw the victim, she refused to convey him to the hospital because his injuries were too serious. She instead called for a Singapore Civil Defence Force ambulance, which arrived at 6.34pm, followed shortly thereafter by the police at 6.42pm. When questioned by the police, the appellant claimed that he had found the victim by the roadside and had then called for the ambulance. The appellant also told the police that he brought the victim to his front porch because he was concerned that he might be run over by vehicles had he been left by the roadside.",
      "15": "On arrival at the hospital, the victim was found to be in a coma, bleeding from his head, and with skull fractures. He passed away seven days later on 21 January 2014. The cause of his death was recorded as bronchopneumonia following multiple fractures of the skull.",
      "16": "In the meantime, the appellant had surrendered himself to the police on 16 January 2014. On the following day, he was charged under s 326 of the PC for voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon. When the victim passed away, the charge was amended to one under s 302 of the PC for murder.",
      "17": "We turn to the key facts which were contested on appeal. In the main, the parties disagreed over: (a) the number of blows inflicted by the appellant to the victim\u2019s head; and (b) whether the appellant was aware of the gravity of the victim\u2019s injuries and that these were likely to be fatal.",
      "18": "It is apposite first to explain the terminology used by the parties and the experts. In the context of this case, the term \u201cimpact\u201d is used to refer to an instance of contact with the body. As an illustration, to say that the victim suffered two impacts on his head would be to say that contact was made with the victim\u2019s head two times. In contrast, the term \u201cblow\u201d refers to an act of hitting. To say that the appellant inflicted two blows to the victim\u2019s head would mean that the appellant hit the victim\u2019s head twice. Finally, it should be borne in mind that the number of injuries that result from an impact or a blow does not necessarily equate to the number of impacts or blows received. For example, it is possible for one impact or blow to result in more than one injury.",
      "19": "At trial, the appellant contended that he inflicted only two blows to the victim\u2019s head. The Defence submitted that this was consistent with the evidence of Dr Vincent Ng Yew Poh (\u201cDr Ng\u201d), a consultant at the National Neuroscience Institute who attended to the victim at the hospital.",
      "20": "The Prosecution\u2019s case, on the other hand, was that the appellant had inflicted at least ten blows to the victim\u2019s head. The Prosecution relied on the evidence of Dr Wee Keng Poh (\u201cDr Wee\u201d), a senior consultant forensic pathologist at the Health Sciences Authority, who performed a post-mortem examination of the victim. He initially testified that there had been ten impacts to the victim\u2019s head, and that these were caused by an instrument such as the dumbbell rod. However, he later clarified that one of the ten impacts to the head of the victim was caused by a fall and not by the rod.",
      "21": "On appeal, the parties changed their respective positions following the admission of further expert evidence. The Defence adduced reports from Dr Ong Beng Beng (\u201cDr Ong\u201d), a senior forensic pathologist with the Queensland Health and Scientific Services, whilst the Prosecution adduced reports from Dr Paul Chui (\u201cDr Chui\u201d), a senior consultant forensic pathologist with the Health Sciences Authority.",
      "22": "Both Dr Ong and Dr Chui agreed that Dr Wee had erred somewhat and that the victim had suffered between six and eight impacts on his head. They further agreed that these impacts were of mild to moderate force, save for one, which led to the skull fractures. This was of moderate to severe force and was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.",
      "23": "The only point of divergence between Dr Ong\u2019s and Dr Chui\u2019s opinions was whether all the impacts should be attributed to the appellant.",
      "24": "Dr Ong thought that two of the impacts \u2013 specifically, the two impacts which Dr Ong and Dr Chui agreed led to the three injuries labelled as C3, C4 and C7 \u2013 could have been caused by the victim hitting his head on \u201cintervening objects\u201d. By this, he meant objects other than the rod used by the appellant, for instance, if the victim had fallen and hit his head on the floor. This was because the injuries from these two impacts were located at the side and back of the victim\u2019s head, where it was possible he might have hit it against some other object as he was falling.",
      "25": "Dr Chui, however, thought that injuries C4 and C7 were consistent with the rod having been used as they were linear in appearance. He also thought that injury C3 could have been caused by the rod, although he did not explain this conclusion. Dr Chui further contended that if injury C7 had been caused by an intervening object, there would have been an underlying skull fracture, which there was not. Dr Chui thus disagreed with Dr Ong\u2019s opinion that the two impacts which led to injuries C3, C4 and C7 could have been caused by intervening objects.",
      "26": "In sum, the Prosecution contended that the appellant inflicted between six and eight blows to the victim\u2019s head, while the Defence submitted that he had inflicted between four and six blows. The Defence arrived at the figure of between four and six blows by subtracting the two impacts which it contended were caused by intervening objects from the total of between six and eight impacts which the victim had suffered to his head.",
      "27": "The other key point of contention between the parties relates to the appellant\u2019s knowledge of the gravity of the injuries that had been suffered by the victim, such knowledge being at the time of, and immediately after, the attack. For reasons which we will explain in greater detail later, our conclusion on this point has a bearing on the sentence to be imposed on the appellant.",
      "28": "The Defence submitted that at the time of the attack, the appellant did not realise that the injuries were likely to be fatal. In support of this, the Defence pointed to the following:\n(a)     The appellant testified that he voluntarily surrendered to the police knowing that the victim was badly injured but not that he would die.\n(b)     The victim was conscious even after the attack and did not pass away until seven days later.\n(c)     The external appearance of the victim\u2019s injuries did not alert the appellant to their fatal nature.\n(d)     Had the appellant realised that the victim\u2019s injuries were fatal, he would not have: (i) openly informed several parties that he had beaten the victim; (ii) claimed that the victim was pretending to be dead; or (iii) splashed water on the victim to \u201cwake him up\u201d.",
      "29": "The Prosecution, on the other hand, submitted that the appellant was well aware of the fatal nature of the injuries, and it relied on the following points in particular:\n(a)     The appellant accepted under cross-examination that hitting someone on the head with the rod could kill that person.\n(b)     The victim was objectively very badly hurt, as evidenced by there being \u201cblood everywhere\u201d.\n(c)     The appellant surrendered because the evidence against him was overwhelming.",
      "30": "We turn to the parties\u2019 cases at trial, beginning with the Prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "31": "According to the Prosecution, the appellant became incensed when the victim refused to admit that he stole the money and he then formed the intention on the spur of the moment to kill the victim. To establish that specific intention, the Prosecution relied on the fact that, despite knowing he was bigger and stronger, the appellant took hold of a dangerous weapon to give himself a clear advantage over the victim. He exerted considerable force with the rod, and targeted a vulnerable part of the victim\u2019s body, namely his head. The Prosecution submitted that the appellant\u2019s intention to kill could also be inferred from the one-sided and relentless nature of the attack, as reflected by the relatively minor injuries sustained by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant continued to attack the victim even when he was bleeding, in a weakened state, and had his back to the appellant.",
      "32": "The Prosecution further submitted that the appellant\u2019s conduct subsequent to the attack was consistent with this specific intention. First, the appellant had tried to hit Chua on the head with the rod, suggesting that he must earlier have also targeted the victim\u2019s head. Second, the appellant continued to beat the victim even when he was unconscious, telling Chua that he would break the victim\u2019s arms and legs if he was not dead. The appellant even warned Chua against interfering, saying that it would make no difference if he killed two persons instead of one. Third, the appellant was not at all remorseful about his actions, but instead made an example of the victim to his other staff, warning them that this would be the consequence if they stole from him. Finally, the appellant attempted to evade detection by cleaning the scene, intimidating witnesses against alerting the authorities, and lying to the police about how he came across the victim or where the rod could be found. The Prosecution argued that the appellant\u2019s attempts to distance himself from the victim suggested that he understood the fatal nature of the victim\u2019s injuries.",
      "33": "The Prosecution also submitted that the appellant was not a credible witness because he had lied to the police as to how he came across the victim\u2019s body. There were also material inconsistencies in his evidence pertaining to the quantity of sleeping tablets he had consumed and when he consumed them, where the attack began, and whether the blows to the victim\u2019s head and to Chua\u2019s hands were intentional.",
      "34": "As for the partial defence of sudden fight, the Prosecution submitted that aside from the appellant\u2019s own testimony, which should be disbelieved on account of his lack of credibility, there was no evidence of any fight. Rather, it was an attack in which the appellant exercised an undue advantage over the victim and acted cruelly, in that despite his overwhelming physical advantage, he struck the victim on the head with a metal rod at least ten times, causing bleeding lacerations and extensive skull fractures.",
      "35": "The defence primarily was that the appellant never intended to kill the victim. Instead, he only wanted to teach the victim, whom he regarded as a \u201cyounger brother\u201d, a lesson for stealing from him. The Defence submitted that the lack of any intention to kill was supported by the fact that throughout the attack, he had used only moderate force. Moreover, he never acted to end the victim\u2019s life over the course of the entire day when he had ample opportunity to do so. Further, it was submitted that he did not specifically target the victim\u2019s head, as evidenced by injuries to various other parts of his body. Indeed, the Defence contended that the blows to the victim\u2019s head were accidental. The appellant had intended to hit the victim\u2019s arms and legs but, because of the latter\u2019s sudden movements, the appellant ended up hitting the victim\u2019s head on two occasions. We digress to note that this particular line of argument was not pursued at the appeal.",
      "36": "The Defence too relied on the post-attack conduct of the appellant but submitted that this pointed away from his having an intention to kill. The appellant had tried to revive the victim by pouring water on him, and he later surrendered himself to the police not knowing that the victim would later die.",
      "37": "The Defence further submitted that the appellant\u2019s testimony was credible and that the inconsistencies in his evidence were attributable to difficulties with recollection and were not deliberate lies. The Defence also contended that Chua\u2019s evidence as to what the appellant had said when hitting the victim should not be relied upon because that evidence was inconsistent and changed during trial. In his statement to the police, Chua had alleged that the appellant said that he would hit the victim \u201cuntil he is dead\u201d and if he did not die, the appellant would \u201cbreak his hands and legs\u201d. However, at trial, Chua changed his evidence and alleged that the appellant said that \u201ceven [if the victim is] not dead, [the appellant] would break his hands and legs\u201d.",
      "38": "The Defence also submitted that there was a break in the chain of causation and that the supervening cause of death was bronchopneumonia. This too was not pursued at the appeal. The Defence also sought to rely on the exception of sudden fight, contending that there was no premeditation and the fight had broken out in the heat of passion over the missing money.",
      "39": "The Defence therefore submitted that the appellant should be convicted for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by a dangerous weapon under s 326 of the PC, instead of murder under s 300(a) of the PC.",
      "40": "The learned High Court judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d) who presided over the trial convicted the appellant of one count of murder under s 300(a) of the PC and sentenced him to death under s 302(1) of the PC as she was bound to do in the circumstances: see PP v Chan Lie Sian [2017] SGHC 205 (\u201cGD\u201d).",
      "41": "In relation to the key disputed facts set out above (see [17]\u2013[29(c)]), the Judge found that the appellant inflicted at least nine blows to the victim\u2019s head. She made no specific finding on the appellant\u2019s knowledge as to the gravity of the injuries he had inflicted. On the number of blows to the victim\u2019s head, the Judge essentially preferred the evidence of Dr Wee over the evidence of Dr Ng. She also accepted Dr Wee\u2019s evidence that one of the head injuries could have been caused by either the rod or a fall, and thus held that the Prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that that specific injury was caused by the appellant: GD at [47]\u2013[50].",
      "42": "The Judge held that the appellant caused the victim\u2019s death. She found that the victim would have succumbed to the head injuries inflicted by the appellant even if he did not contract bronchopneumonia, and that bronchopneumonia was, in any case, a foreseeable consequence of the victim\u2019s injuries: GD at [54]\u2013[56].",
      "43": "The Judge also found (GD at [57]) that the appellant had intended to cause the victim\u2019s death because:\n(a)     It was extremely difficult to believe that the appellant accidentally hit the victim\u2019s head nine times.\n(b)     The attack was vicious. The appellant used a metal rod to inflict nine blows to the victim\u2019s head, which is a vulnerable part of the body. This caused blood to splatter onto the ceiling, walls and bed, and resulted in the victim suffering severe skull fractures and extensive head and brain injuries. The cruel nature of the attack strongly indicated that the appellant intended to cause the victim\u2019s death.\n(c)     The attack was one-sided. The victim was considerably smaller than the appellant, who agreed that he had overpowered the victim. The victim was also unarmed throughout the attack, whilst the appellant was armed with a lethal weapon. As a result, the victim suffered extensive and severe injuries while the appellant only had some minor injuries.\n(d)     Despite the one-sided nature of the attack, the appellant persisted in attacking the victim. When the victim was already bleeding from his head and weakened from the fight in the living room, the appellant pursued him into Bedroom 1 and continued to attack him there. He later beat the victim some more in Chua\u2019s presence, when he was lying on the bed groaning and covered in blood. It was telling that the appellant admitted in cross-examination that he was determined to beat the victim until he confessed to stealing the appellant\u2019s money, and did not intend to stop even if he killed the victim.\n(e)     The appellant admitted that he knew that hitting a person on the head with the rod could kill. The necessary conclusion was thus that the appellant intended to cause the victim\u2019s death when he deliberately attacked him on the head with the rod.\n(f)     The appellant\u2019s conduct after the attack also reflected the intention to kill. He continued to beat him in Chua\u2019s presence, remarking that even \u201cif [the victim] did not die, he [would] break [the victim\u2019s] hands and legs\u201d and that it made no difference to him whether he killed one or two persons.",
      "44": "The Judge found that the appellant could not rely on the partial defence of sudden fight as it was clear that the appellant had taken undue advantage of the victim and had acted in a cruel and unusual manner: GD at [61].",
      "45": "Finally, the Judge observed (GD at [62]\u2013[65]) that the appellant was not a credible witness because:\n(a)     His assertion of the blows to the victim\u2019s head being accidental was incredible and contradicted by the objective evidence.\n(b)     Over the course of the investigations, the appellant had lied to the police.\n(c)     Throughout the course of the investigations and in court, the appellant sought to downplay the extent of his attack. Although he initially admitted to hitting the victim\u2019s head in a statement to the police, he later explained that this had been accidental in a further statement. Likewise, in court, the appellant claimed that the victim was not in as critical a condition after the attack as the other witnesses made him out to be.\n(d)     The appellant\u2019s evidence on various aspects was contradicted by the accounts of other witnesses, especially Chua. The Judge found that Chua was a reliable eyewitness and his account of the facts was generally supported by the other witnesses and the medical and scientific evidence.",
      "46": "On appeal, the Defence argued that the Judge erred in finding that the appellant intended to kill the victim. The arguments advanced in support of the appeal were essentially reiterations of the arguments that had been advanced at trial and we do not repeat them here, save to highlight a few points.",
      "47": "First, the Defence submitted that the appellant\u2019s evidence at trial had to be viewed in its proper context. In relation to his assertion that he knew hitting a person on the head with the rod could kill, the Defence contended that the appellant might not have properly understood the question. In any case, knowing that hitting someone on the head with a dumbbell rod could kill that person does not inevitably lead to the conclusion that because he had hit the victim with such a rod, the appellant must have intended to kill him.",
      "48": "Second, it was submitted that if the partial defence of sudden fight was not established, and if the appellant were convicted of murder, then this should be under s 300(c) and the appellant should be sentenced to life imprisonment and not death, as he did not exhibit, in his conduct at the material times, a blatant disregard for human life.",
      "49": "The Prosecution, on the other hand, submitted that the Judge correctly concluded that: (a) the appellant was not a credible witness; (b) the appellant intended to kill the victim; and (c) the partial defence of sudden fight was not applicable. In the alternative to its primary case, the Prosecution maintained that if the conviction for murder under s 300(a) were set aside, the appellant should instead be convicted of murder under s 300(c).",
      "50": "In that event, the Prosecution submitted that he should nonetheless be sentenced to death because he had exhibited a blatant disregard for human life.",
      "51": "The following issues thus arise for consideration:\n(a)     Should the appellant\u2019s conviction under s 300(a) stand?\n(b)     If the appellant\u2019s conviction under s 300(a) is reversed, should the appellant be convicted under s 300(c)?\n(c)     If the appellant is convicted under s 300(c), what is the sentence that we should impose?",
      "52": "We begin by addressing the factual issues raised in the appeal.",
      "53": "To recapitulate, the dispute between the parties relates to whether two of the impacts to the victim\u2019s head \u2013 specifically, the two impacts which led to the three injuries labelled as C3, C4 and C7 \u2013 were caused by intervening objects. In all it appears there were between six and eight impacts (see [22]). The experts were not able to ascertain the precise number of impacts because it was possible, as we have noted at [18] above, for a single impact to cause more than one injury. For the reasons that follow, in our judgment, only four of the impacts to the victim\u2019s head may properly be attributed to the appellant as blows that he delivered for the following reasons.",
      "54": "First, we note that the Prosecution\u2019s own witness, Dr Wee, agreed that injury C3 could have been caused by a fall (see [20]).",
      "55": "Second, Dr Chui did state that injuries C4 and C7 were consistent with having been inflicted using the rod because they were linear in appearance. However, injuries C4 and C7 could equally have been caused by intervening objects that were similar in shape to the rod, such as the edge of the glass table in the living room or the edge of the cabinet in Bedroom 1. We note that the attack continued in both the living room and Bedroom 1 and according to the appellant, the victim had fallen down in both locations. As for injury C3, no reason was given by Dr Chui for his conclusion that injury C3 could have been caused by the rod. Furthermore, Dr Chui\u2019s testimony does not exclude the possibility that injury C3 could instead have been caused by one or more intervening objects.",
      "56": "We also reject Dr Chui\u2019s opinion that injury C7 could not have been caused by an intervening object because it was not accompanied by an underlying skull fracture. As Dr Chui himself noted, there were injuries to the victim\u2019s head that were caused by the use of the rod but which were not accompanied by underlying skull fractures. In these circumstances, we can see no reason why, unlike an impact caused by the use of the rod, an impact with an intervening object would necessarily have been accompanied by a skull fracture, and nothing has been advanced in the evidence to explain this.",
      "57": "The Prosecution relied on a part of Dr Chui\u2019s evidence where he said that, given the curvature of the skull, it would be highly unlikely that an impact by the rod on one side of the head should result in an injury on the diametrically opposite side of the head. The paragraph from Dr Chui\u2019s report that was relied on by the Prosecution reads:",
      "58": "In our judgment, this should be considered in the context of what Dr Ong was saying and to which this was a response. Dr Ong contended that the force from an impact to, for example, the left side of the victim\u2019s head could result in his hitting the right side of his head against an intervening object, thus causing an injury on that side of his head. Dr Chui\u2019s evidence was that, without more, an impact to one part of the head would not result in a laceration on the opposite side of the head. But this says nothing about the possibility of such an injury arising from hitting some other object.",
      "59": "Third, the appellant consistently testified at trial that the victim fell multiple times. We reproduce a few extracts from the appellant\u2019s testimony:",
      "60": "Although the appellant did not explicitly state that the victim hit his head when he fell, this is not surprising since the appellant could well have been too engrossed in the attack to notice such a detail.",
      "61": "For these reasons, we think there is nothing to distinguish the cogency of the parties\u2019 respective cases as to whether two of the impacts could have been caused by intervening objects. As we stated in Tan Chor Jin v PP [2008] 4 SLR(R) 306 at [34] and later affirmed in Eu Lim Hoklai v PP [2011] 3 SLR 167 at [64], the scenario which favours the accused person should be preferred in cases where multiple inferences may be drawn from the same set of facts. We thus accord the appellant the benefit of the doubt and do not attribute to him two of the impacts to the victim\u2019s head (the two impacts which led to the injuries labelled C3, C4 and C7). This leaves us with between four and six impacts for which the appellant might be held responsible. However, it remains the case that the benefit of any reasonable doubt should be given to the appellant. Since on the evidence, it is not possible to resolve the uncertainty as to whether the remaining injuries were caused by four or more impacts to the head of the victim, we proceed on the basis that is most favourable to the appellant and conclude that there were four such impacts that were attributable to the appellant as blows that he inflicted.",
      "62": "We turn to consider whether the appellant was aware that the victim\u2019s injuries were likely to be fatal. On the evidence, we are satisfied that while the appellant knew that the victim was badly injured, he was unaware that the injuries were likely to be fatal.",
      "63": "The appellant consistently testified that he did not know that the injuries were so severe as to be likely to cause the victim\u2019s death. The Prosecution did not challenge the appellant on this part of his testimony, as reflected in the excerpts reproduced below:",
      "64": "It is evident that the Prosecution never directly challenged the appellant\u2019s evidence that he was unaware that the victim\u2019s injuries were likely to be fatal. The closest the Prosecution came to challenging the appellant\u2019s evidence was when the appellant admitted that hitting someone on the head with a dumbbell rod could kill:",
      "65": "As to this, we have two observations. First, while much was made of this testimony, with respect, it seems to us to have been largely irrelevant because while it is self-evident that hitting someone on the head with a dumbbell rod could kill that person, that simply does not mean very much without considering such other critical details as the force of the blow, where exactly it was delivered, precisely what the parties were doing at the time the blow was delivered, and how heavy the rod was. While each of these aspects were discretely dealt with in the evidence, the question that was put to the appellant was largely meaningless without being framed with reference to the underlying premises. Second, and in keeping with what we have just said, the question posed by the Prosecution did not sufficiently challenge the appellant\u2019s evidence that he was unaware of the fatal nature of the victim\u2019s injuries at the time of and in the immediate aftermath of the attack. It was not at all clear that the Prosecution\u2019s question was addressing the specific question of whether the appellant was in fact aware, at the time of and in the immediate aftermath of the actual attack, that the victim\u2019s injuries were likely to be fatal. The Prosecution\u2019s question was instead phrased as a hypothetical, directed at the appellant\u2019s state of knowledge at the time of the trial, as to the potentially fatal nature of such attacks without specific reference to the other premises we have referred to.",
      "66": "As we have held in a line of authorities including Teoh Kah Lin v PP [1994] 3 SLR(R) 859 at [20], Ong Pang Siew v PP [2011] 1 SLR 606 at [81] and AOF v PP [2012] 3 SLR 34 at [221], failure on the part of the cross-examining party to challenge a witness\u2019s testimony may commonly be taken to be acceptance of it. Having failed to challenge the appellant\u2019s testimony that he was unaware of the fatal nature of the victim\u2019s injury, we are satisfied that the Prosecution must be taken not to have controverted this part of the appellant\u2019s evidence.",
      "67": "Further, in our judgment, when regard is had to the totality of the appellant\u2019s conduct, it is simply not possible to conclude that he was aware of the fatal nature of the victim\u2019s injuries at the time of the attack and in its immediate aftermath. After the attack, the appellant: (a) became upset at the victim for feigning death; and (b) said that he would attack the victim again when he regained consciousness. The appellant further surrendered himself to the police precisely because he thought that the victim\u2019s injuries were not fatal, and expected that he would be and was in fact initially charged with an offence under s 326 of the PC. The appellant\u2019s evidence on his reason for surrendering was likewise not challenged by the Prosecution.",
      "68": "We turn to outline the law on s 300(a) of the PC. It is well established that for an accused person to be convicted under s 300(a) of the PC, he must have done the act by which death is caused, with the specific intention to cause death. As we held in Iskandar bin Rahmat v PP [2017] 1 SLR 505 (\u201cIskandar\u201d) at [34], such an intention to cause death need not be premeditated, and can instead be formed on the spur of the moment. But it must be a specific intention to cause the death of that person.",
      "69": "It seems to us that the highest the Prosecution\u2019s case could fairly be put was that an inference could be drawn that the appellant intended to cause the victim\u2019s death if regard were had only to the immediate circumstances of the attack. After all, the appellant delivered at least four blows to the victim\u2019s head, a vulnerable part of his body, using a metal rod weighing 1.46kg. Of these, at least one was delivered with moderate to severe force, causing extensive fractures in the thickest part of the skull bone. That injury was sufficient in itself, in the ordinary course of nature, to cause the death of the victim.",
      "70": "Further, we do not accept that the blows to the head were accidental. Although the appellant mentioned that he had hit the victim\u2019s head in his statements to the police dated 22 and 24 January 2014, it was only in his statement dated 27 January 2014 (which was his fourth statement) that the appellant claimed that the blows were accidental. If those blows had indeed been accidental, one would have expected the appellant to have said this at the earliest opportunity. The fact that he did not, suggests that this assertion was an afterthought. Further, the appellant\u2019s version of events that he accidentally hit the victim on the head twice does not cohere with the medical evidence that there were no less than four blows to the victim\u2019s head. Lastly, we find it incredible that in a short span of 15 minutes, the appellant could have been so unfortunate as to accidentally hit the victim\u2019s head at least four times. In our judgment, counsel for the appellant was right at the hearing of the appeal, to have abandoned the position that the blows to the victim\u2019s head were all accidental.",
      "71": "However, it would be wrong to analyse the evidence having regard only to the events that culminated in the initial attack. In PP v Oh Laye Koh [1994] 2 SLR(R) 120 at [24], we observed that whether the accused person intended to cause death is something to be inferred from the totality of the surrounding circumstances. In our judgment, the totality of the circumstances, including the appellant\u2019s conduct after the attack, negates such an inference being drawn. In undertaking this analysis, it is helpful to first recount our finding at [66] above that the appellant did not, at the material time, appreciate the fatal nature of the victim\u2019s injuries. In that light, his conduct subsequent to the attack is simply incompatible with his having harboured a specific intention to kill the victim, for the following reasons.",
      "72": "First, if the appellant had intended to kill the victim, it would have been entirely incongruous for him to omit to see to it that the victim was killed. He plainly had ample opportunity to do so because the appellant and the victim were alone in the lodging house throughout the initial attack. With no witnesses around and with the victim lying helpless on the bed, the appellant had every opportunity to bring any such intention to kill to fruition. Yet, he did not do so even though the victim was clearly alive. When we put this to the Prosecution, we were told that he could have subsequently had a change of heart. But this was never the case advanced by the Prosecution. Nor is there any reason at all for thinking that there was any reason for the appellant to have had any change in his intentions on that fateful day.",
      "73": "The appellant also eschewed all subsequent opportunities to ensure the victim\u2019s death. Shortly after Chua arrived at the lodging house, the appellant attacked the victim afresh. However, he only targeted the victim\u2019s limbs and not any vulnerable body parts. To add to this, the impacts were only of mild to moderate force when the appellant would have been expected to exert more force had he in fact wished to kill the victim. We note Chua\u2019s evidence that the appellant made statements to the effect that: (a) even if the victim did not die, the appellant would break his hands and legs; and (b) it made no difference whether he killed one or two persons. In our judgment, these utterances were equally consistent with a manifestation of bravado designed to intimidate Chua. Indeed, his express statements to Chua that this was the fate that would befall those who stole from him supports this. Simply put, despite the ample opportunities that were plainly available to him, he did not act to end the victim\u2019s life at a time when he was plainly still alive.",
      "74": "Further, if the appellant had intended to kill the victim, various aspects of his conduct are simply inexplicable. It would have been entirely against his interest for him to have openly admitted to what had transpired to so many others, as he did to Chua, Aw, Gan, Tan, Koh and T H Tan. We note that T H Tan was barely even an acquaintance of the appellant. Indeed, the appellant had asked Chua and Tan to come to the lodging house, thus giving rise to the existence of witnesses where there had been none. The appellant even showed Gan and Tan the weapon he had used. In our judgment, the appellant\u2019s lack of furtiveness points away from his having harboured a specific intention to kill the victim, and incidentally also strengthens our conclusion that the appellant did not appreciate the fatal nature of the victim\u2019s injuries at the material time (see [66]).",
      "75": "We recognise that the appellant did take some initial steps to conceal his involvement in the victim\u2019s injuries. He instructed Gan to dispose of the rod and lied to the police about how he came across the victim. But, in our judgment, these attempts to conceal are equally consistent with his having had a settled intention to severely injure rather than specifically to kill the victim.",
      "76": "Finally, if the appellant had attacked the victim intending to kill him, it would have made no sense for him to have later: (a) tried to revive him by pouring a pail of water on him; (b) accused him of feigning death; or (c) said that he would attack him again when he regained consciousness. In our judgment, the appellant\u2019s conduct, when considered in its totality, suggests that he did not specifically intend to kill the victim.",
      "77": "The Prosecution contended that the appellant\u2019s conduct subsequent to the attack could have been contrived in order to conceal his earlier actions which had been undertaken with the intention to kill the victim. We have no hesitation in rejecting this hypothesis, which in our respectful view, is far-fetched. It would have taken extraordinary presence of mind for the appellant, immediately after attacking the victim intending to kill him, to then have called the witnesses to the lodging house and acted as he did in order to fashion them into witnesses capable of corroborating a lesser intention on the part of the appellant, all while the victim was still alive!",
      "78": "For these reasons, we find that the Judge erred in convicting the appellant under s 300(a) of the PC and we set aside that conviction.",
      "79": "We turn then to consider whether the appellant should be convicted under s 300(c) of the PC.",
      "80": "The ingredients of murder under s 300(c) of the PC are well established. They are that: (a) death has been caused to a person by an act of the accused person; (b) the act resulting in bodily injury was done with the intention of causing that bodily injury to the victim; and (c) the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death: Wang Wenfeng v PP [2012] 4 SLR 590 at [32].",
      "81": "We are satisfied that all three ingredients under s 300(c) of the PC are made out beyond a reasonable doubt. Counsel for the appellant did not seriously challenge this at the appeal.",
      "82": "First, it is no longer disputed that the appellant caused the victim\u2019s death. Second, the appellant intended to cause the relevant bodily injury to the victim. As we explained earlier (at [69]), we wholly reject any suggestion that the blows to the victim\u2019s head were accidental and this, in any case, was not pursued at the appeal by the appellant. Finally, the forensic pathologists were unanimous in concluding that the victim\u2019s skull fractures were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Crucially, the victim\u2019s skull fractures were associated with the injuries labelled C1 and C2, and not the injuries labelled C3, C4 or C7. What this means is that the skull fractures were not caused by intervening objects (see [60]), but by the appellant.",
      "83": "Exception 4 to s 300 of the PC provides that culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. The three elements of the partial defence of sudden fight are: (a) a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel; (b) an absence of premeditation; and (c) an absence of undue advantage or cruel or unusual acts: Iskandar ([67] supra) at [57]. As we held in Tan Chun Seng v PP [2003] 2 SLR(R) 506 at [21(c)], the courts have placed substantial emphasis on the disparity in size or strength as between the victim and accused person in determining whether undue advantage was taken.",
      "84": "We are satisfied that the appellant cannot avail himself of the partial defence of sudden fight. The appellant held an undue advantage over the victim given that he was armed with a lethal weapon and further enjoyed a considerable physical advantage by virtue of his physique. The appellant stood at 174cm, weighed 77kg, and engaged in weight-lifting training. In comparison, the victim stood at 166cm and weighed 50kg, earning him the nickname \u201cWilliam Kia\u201d, which is Hokkien for \u201cWilliam child\u201d or \u201clittle William\u201d. As the appellant admitted, the victim did not have much of a chance of defending himself against the appellant. Moreover, the appellant attacked the victim relentlessly, continuing even when the victim was weakened and had been overpowered, as he admitted at trial. We therefore substitute the appellant\u2019s conviction under s 300(a) of the PC with a conviction under s 300(c) of the PC.",
      "85": "Section 302(2) of the PC affords the courts a discretion to sentence an accused person convicted under s 300(c) of the PC to either life imprisonment and caning, or death. We have held in a line of authorities beginning with PP v Kho Jabing [2015] 2 SLR 112 at [44]\u2013[45] (\u201cKho Jabing\u201d), that the death penalty is warranted where the actions of the offender outrage the feelings of the community, and this would be the case where these actions exhibit viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life (see also Micheal Anak Garing v PP [2017] 1 SLR 748 at [47] and PP v Chia Kee Chen [2018] 2 SLR 249 (\u201cChia Kee Chen\u201d) at [110]).",
      "86": "In Kho Jabing at [45] and Chia Kee Chen at [110], we observed that it is the manner in which the offender acted which takes centre stage. Relevant considerations include the number of stabs or blows inflicted, the area of injury, the duration of the attack, the force used, the mental state of the offender, and the offender\u2019s actual role or participation in the attack.",
      "87": "In this case, we are not satisfied that the manner in which the appellant acted evinces that blatant disregard for human life. The Prosecution argued that the appellant had exhibited such disregard in:\n(a)     preventing others from obtaining medical attention for the victim and shifting his focus to evading detection when medical attention could no longer be avoided;\n(b)     wanting the victim to suffer as much as possible by using the rod even though he was much smaller, weaker and, unlike the appellant, was unarmed; and\n(c)     parading the victim\u2019s bloodied and bruised body before his staff, to show the consequences of offending the appellant.",
      "88": "In our judgment, none of the arguments advanced by the Prosecution establish that the appellant was acting at the material time with a blatant disregard for human life.",
      "89": "First, we have found at [61]\u2013[66] that the appellant was not aware, at the time of the attack or in its immediate aftermath, of the fatal nature of the victim\u2019s injuries. Although we agree with the Prosecution that the victim was objectively in need of medical attention and that his condition would, in the ordinary course of nature, cause death, this is irrelevant to the question of whether the appellant acted with a blatant disregard for human life. An examination of the appellant\u2019s regard for human life must necessarily be informed by the appellant\u2019s knowledge and state of mind at the relevant time. If the appellant honestly believed that the victim\u2019s injuries were not fatal, the fact that the victim\u2019s injuries were objectively fatal would not, in itself, be sufficient to demonstrate that the appellant acted in blatant disregard for human life in preventing the witnesses from obtaining medical attention for the victim and parading the victim\u2019s body to show the consequences of offending the appellant. The most that can be said about the appellant\u2019s conduct is that his actions exhibit a blatant disregard for the victim\u2019s welfare, which does not carry with it the necessary sanction of the death penalty.",
      "90": "Second, we reject the Prosecution\u2019s submission that the appellant wanted the victim to suffer as much as possible. There is no evidence of such an intention. The Prosecution relied on the fact that the appellant armed himself with the rod even though the victim was smaller, weaker and unarmed. While this denies the appellant recourse to the partial defence of sudden fight, we cannot see how it proves an intention to inflict as much suffering as possible. The circumstances in the present case differ greatly from those in Chia Kee Chen ([84] supra), where one of the reasons we found the accused person to have exhibited a blatant disregard for human life was his desire for the victim there to suffer as much as possible before dying. Our finding in Chia Kee Chen was based on the accused person\u2019s many police statements to that effect. Among other things, he had said (Chia Kee Chen at [65]) that he:",
      "91": "This expressed intention was also consistent with the viciousness of the attack, which resulted in the fracture of almost every bone in the victim\u2019s skull from the bottom of his eye socket to his lower jaw: Chia Kee Chen at [1] and [141]. In the present case, the appellant cannot be said to have harboured a comparable desire to inflict such suffering. Had he done so, the principal attack would not have lasted only 15 minutes and the blows to the victim\u2019s head would not have almost entirely resulted in impacts of only mild to moderate force.",
      "92": "Finally, it is apposite to contrast the present case with Kho Jabing ([84] supra). The accused person in Kho Jabing set out to commit robbery together with his co-accused person. The accused person approached the victim from behind and struck him on the head with a piece of wood, causing him to fall to the ground. When the victim turned around to face upwards, the accused person struck him on the head once more. The accused person then proceeded to hit the victim\u2019s head at least two more times even though he was not reacting at all. The majority in Kho Jabing sentenced the respondent to the death penalty, finding that the accused person exhibited a blatant disregard for human life by inflicting completely unnecessary additional blows to the victim\u2019s head: Kho Jabing at [71]\u2013[72].",
      "93": "Here, the evidence of the experts is that the victim would have been incapacitated by the blow which caused the skull fractures. However, unlike Kho Jabing, it is not possible to determine whether the appellant inflicted additional blows to the victim\u2019s head gratuitously after that, because the experts were unable to determine the sequence of these blows. It is therefore not possible to make a finding on whether the incapacitating blow was delivered before the other blows to the victim\u2019s head, in which case the other blows would have been gratuitous, or after, in which case the same could not be said. Furthermore, it is significant that after the principal attack, which lasted about 15 minutes, all the blows that were inflicted by the appellant were not directed at the victim\u2019s head. The somewhat indiscriminate manner in which the attack was effected, with many blows to the body as well, further seems to us to demonstrate that the appellant believed on the whole that the blows he inflicted were not fatal, and that he was essentially intent on wanting to teach the victim a \u201clesson\u201d (albeit in a wholly perverse and misguided manner). This is also consistent with our analysis of the facts set out at [71]\u2013[75] above.",
      "94": "The settled jurisprudence of this court requires that the Prosecution establish the additional element we have set out at [84] above, before the court will impose the death penalty. In undertaking this inquiry, the court should examine the evidence closely and determine the precise findings it has made and it should not be distracted by the gruesomeness of the scene of the crime. Having reviewed the evidence, we are not satisfied that the Prosecution has established that additional element. We therefore allow the appeal and set aside the death penalty and impose a sentence of life imprisonment instead.",
      "95": "For the foregoing reasons, we substitute the appellant\u2019s conviction under s 300(a) of the PC with a conviction under s 300(c) of the PC and sentence him to life imprisonment. The appellant is spared from caning as he is above the age of 50."
