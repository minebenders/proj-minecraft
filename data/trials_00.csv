52,[2013] SGDC 389 ADITH S/O SARVOTHAM,"The prosecution objected to probation and submitted that due to the serious nature of the drug trafficking offence in DAC 24697/2013, the appropriate sentence is RTC, while the defence is of the view of that probation should be the appropriate sentence. After careful consideration of the written submissions of both parties, I rejected the prosecution submission and took the view that it would be sufficient deterrence for the present MDA offences to impose on the AP a maximum period of 36 months’ probation with voluntary residence at a residential facility (The New Charis Mission) for a period of 12 months; 6 months’ electronic tagging upon his discharge from the New Charis Mission; 240 hours of community service; indoor time restriction between 10 pm to 6 am; undergoing of regular urine test; a Court review in 15 months’ time; and for his mother and maternal uncle to be bonded to ensure his good behaviour during probation. My reasons are as follows:
(i)     While I agreed with the prosecution that drug trafficking counts as one of those serious crimes (not unlike a harassment offence under the Moneylenders Act[note: 24]) with deterrence as a dominant sentencing principle, I am unable to agree with the prosecution’s broad brush approach against the grant of probation to every young drug trafficker because the Court has to, “especially where young offenders were involved, carefully assess the facts in each case and not apply the general rule of deterrence as a matter of course. There are many facets to public interest. It cannot be in the public interest that every young drug offender be incarcerated and be exposed to the negative influences of hardened criminals in the prison environment. The rehabilitation of the young who had gone astray is a fundamental tenet of our society” and “society would indeed want to see young offenders turning over a new leaf to become law abiding citizens who would make positive contributions to its development”[note: 25].
(ii)     If it had been Parliament's intention to take away the option of rehabilitation of young offenders (by way of probation or reformative training as may be considered by the Court to be appropriate in a particular case) in relation to a particular offence or a category of offences (such as drug trafficking offences), then this intention had to be made clear in the statute[note: 26]. I note that the MDA did not specifically prohibit the Court from placing a young drug trafficker on probation if the Court found it appropriate to do so. In fact, the law on probation was explicitly amended to apply specifically to young offenders even if they had committed offences punishable with specified minimum sentences[note: 27] (such as the present MDA drug trafficking offences) which are generally the more serious offences.
(iii)     While I agreed with the prosecution that drug trafficking is a grave offence","The prosecution objected to probation and submitted that due to the serious nature of the drug trafficking offence in DAC 24697/2013, the appropriate sentence is RTC, while the defence is of the view of that probation should be the appropriate sentence .

193,[2020] SGDC 41 YUSRI BIN AHMAD,"the accused also pleaded guilty to one stood down charge involving consumption of a specified drug. As the accused has appealed against his sentence and conviction, I will now set out the reasons for my decision. I found that the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused received the drugs from Taamo at the Jelita loading/unloading bay and that he subsequently threw the drugs out of his car when he was in the vicinity of Dover MRT station. Taamo’s evidence was unequivocal, his job was to bring drugs in from Malaysia and to hand them to one of “John’s” men at Jelita in exchange for cash. However, the Court still had to decide the issue of whether the accused knew of the nature of the drugs. I took the following into account in arriving at my finding that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the requisite knowledge:
43.1.     The accused handed a large bundle of cash amounting to $10,000 to Taamo. Taamo testified that the person who handed him the cash said “duit” meaning cash. This meant that the accused knew full well he was handing a bundle of cash to Taamo and not just a few loose notes. The thickness of the bundle TV-A1 can be seen in photos 94-95. The natural inference would be that he was receiving something of equivalent value in exchange.
43.2.     The accused would have been able to recognise that the black bag contained illicit drugs had he looked inside. Since he had just handed over $10,000 in exchange for the black plastic bag, it would stand to reason that he would have inspected the contents to make sure he had gotten what he had paid for.
43.3.     The accused’s post-incident behavior of driving recklessly and subsequently throwing the drugs out of his car windows leads to the irresistible inference that he knew that the black plastic bag he received from Taamo contained illegal drugs.
43.4.     Despite evidence to the contrary, the accused continued to deny that he gave Taamo money in exchange for drugs. In maintaining this stance, the accused lost the opportunity to explain (in order to raise a reasonable doubt) why he was giving $10,000 to a total stranger and what he thought he was receiving in return for the money. SSgt Mhd Nasrulhaq (PW17) recorded a statement from the accused at City Loft. As the accused challenged the voluntariness of the statement, an ancillary hearing was conducted and I found that the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was made voluntarily.","After the trial, the accused also pleaded guilty to one stood down charge involving consumption of a specified drug .

197,[2020] SGHC 121 SRITHARAN K RAJA RAJAN,"Having been convicted of the present charge, the accused was liable to be punished under s 33(1) of the MDA. The punishment prescribed under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the MDA is death. Nevertheless, the court retained the discretion under s 33B(1)(a) read with s 33B(2) of the MDA to instead sentence the offender to life imprisonment and a minimum of 15 strokes of the cane, subject to the requirements in those provisions being met. Section 33B(1)(a) of the MDA provides that if the two cumulative requirements set out in ss 33B(2)(a) and (b) are satisfied, the court has the discretion not to impose the death penalty. The first requirement in s 33B(2)(a) is that the acts of the accused were restricted to those listed in s 33B(2)(a)(i)–(iv) of the MDA, which have been referred to as those of a courier. The second requirement in s 33B(2)(b) is that the Public Prosecutor certifies that the accused has substantially assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. The law on similar fact evidence has been comprehensively considered in recent decisions. In evaluating the admissibility of similar fact evidence, a balance must be struck between its probative value and its prejudicial effect. In this inquiry, the cogency, strength of inference the evidence provides and relevance of the evidence should be considered: see Ng Beng Siang and others v Public Prosecutor [2003","Having been convicted of the present charge, the accused was liable to be punished under s 33(1) of the MDA .
